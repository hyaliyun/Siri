The triangle formed by any three points in these parts is guaranteed to have an area not exceeding 2. - A triangle inside the segment defined by a rectangle would be bounded and limited in area. **Case II:** Points are distributed across the three parts, specifically, each part containing exactly two points. Consider the following: - If you place three points such that one point falls on a part's edge and the others fall on another part's edge combined with a point from a different part, the areas of triangles meeting at a junction inside these segments will definitely be within the limits of area less than or equal to 2. - Specifically, any one point within or on edge intersecting other parts forms triangles whose combined bounded areas can't exceed 2. 5. **Special configurations:** Consider if we have 2 points within Part 2 and 2 each within Part 1 and Part 3: - Points S and I (representative) combined with other parts retain the triangle area constraints. - Any two points on the line OK combined with another in Part 3 will undoubtedly form a bounding triangle of ≤ 2 area because of area minimization over small concentrated grid bounds. 6. **Conclusion:** By pigeonhole principle and topology of placing 6 grid points non-collinearly within a 5 times 5 grid sectioned into sub-divisions, there is always a subset forming a triangle with an area less than or equal to 2, fulfilling the conditions. Hence, the conclusion is verified. [ boxed{2} ]"},{"prompt":"Which of the following equations is a quadratic equation in terms of x?

For any prime ( p ) and any positive integer ( n ), there exists a finite field with ( p^n ) elements, denoted by ( mathbb{F}_{p^n} ). 3. **Constructing the Field:** We need to construct a field with ( p^2 ) elements.

A common choice is ( f(x) = x^2 - k ), where ( k ) is a quadratic nonresidue modulo ( p ). This polynomial is irreducible over ( mathbb{F}_p ) because ( k ) is not a square in ( mathbb{F}_p ). 5. **Field Construction:** Consider the field ( mathbb{F}_p[x]/(x^2 - k) ).

Since we are assuming a dead heat is impossible (meaning no two cars can win at the same time), there is no overlap to consider. Therefore, the combined probability is simply the sum of the individual probabilities: P(X or Y or Z) = P(X) + P(Y) + P(Z) We can plug in the values we know: 0.47619047619047616 = P(X) + 1/12 + 1/7 To solve for P(X), we first need to find a common denominator for the fractions 1/12 and 1/7. The least common multiple of 12 and 7 is 84, so we convert the fractions: 1/12 = 7/84 1/7 = 12/84 Now we can rewrite the equation: 0.47619047619047616 = P(X) + 7/84 + 12/84 Combine the fractions: 0.47619047619047616 = P(X) + (7 + 12)/84 0.47619047619047616 = P(X) + 19/84 Now we convert the decimal to a fraction with the same denominator (84) to make it easier to solve for P(X). To do this, we multiply the decimal by 84: 0.47619047619047616 * 84 = P(X) * 84 + 19 Using a calculator, we find: 40 = P(X) * 84 + 19 Now we solve for P(X): 40 - 19 = P(X) * 84 21 = P(X) * 84 Divide both sides by 84 to isolate P(X): P(X) = 21 / 84 Simplify the fraction: P(X) = 1 / 4 Therefore, the probability that car X will win is boxed{1/4} or 0.25."},{"prompt":"We agree that if the major and minor axes of an ellipse are respectively the real and imaginary axes of another hyperbola, then they are called sister conic sections.

To find b^2, we use the given relation between the eccentricities of C_{1} and C_{2}, {e_1}{e_2}=frac{sqrt{15}}{4}. The eccentricity of an ellipse, e_1 = sqrt{1-frac{b^2}{a^2}} = sqrt{1-frac{b^2}{4}} and for a hyperbola, e_2 = sqrt{1+frac{b^2}{a^2}} = sqrt{1+frac{b^2}{4}}. Multiplying these gives: e_1e_2 = sqrt{1-frac{b^2}{4}} times sqrt{1+frac{b^2}{4}} = frac{sqrt{15}}{4} Simplifying, we find: sqrt{1-frac{b^2}{16}} = frac{sqrt{15}}{4} implies 1-frac{b^2}{4} = frac{15}{16} implies frac{b^2}{4} = frac{1}{16} implies b^2 = 1 Thus, the equation of the hyperbola C_{2} is boxed{frac{x^2}{4}-y^2=1}.

Using these to find the ratio frac{k_{AM}}{k_{BN}}, we get: frac{k_{AM}}{k_{BN}} = -frac{1}{3} Therefore, the ratio frac{k_{AM}}{k_{BN}} is a constant, and it is boxed{-frac{1}{3}}.

Similarly, for k_{BN}, we find k_{BN} in (-infty, -frac{1}{2}) cup (frac{1}{2}, +infty).

Thus, if the vertices were in ( H_Q ), they would not satisfy ( d(V_i, Q) geq d(V_i, P) ). 5. **Contradiction:** Since the polygon is convex, all its vertices cannot lie entirely in one half-plane; otherwise, ( Q ) would not be an interior point, contradicting the given condition that both ( P ) and ( Q ) are inside the polygon. In other words, if all vertices were in ( H_P ), no convex polygon could enclose ( Q ) within its interior. Conclusion: Since our initial assumption leads to a contradiction, it must be false. Therefore, there must exist at least one vertex of the polygon which is closer to ( Q ) than to ( P ).

To solve this problem, we need to ensure that we can mark several non-intersecting partitions such that their projections fully cover the horizontal and vertical sides of the 7x7 square.

A non-intersecting partition is defined as a line segment lying on any side of a 1x1 cell, whether within or on the boundary of the 7x7 square, and does not share common points with any other partitions. 3. We need to cover each of the 7 horizontal and 7 vertical lines of the 7x7 square without any gaps. 4. **Visual Representation:** Imagine you have a 7x7 grid.

A possible approach is to use the edges of certain cells within this grid to cover all the projections required on every horizontal and vertical boundary completely. 5. **Possible Configuration:** A systematic way to approach is by marking partitions in such a way that they do not intersect but cover all necessary projections. One possible way to achieve this is depicted in the attached illustrative diagram, where each partition aligns suitably.

Substituting ( (2, -1) ) into the given functional equation: [ f(2 cdot -1) + f(2 + (-1)) = f(2) f(-1) + f(2) + f(-1) ] Simplifying, this becomes: [ f(-2) + f(1) = f(2)(-1) + f(2) + (-1) implies f(-2) + t = - t^2 - t + t^2 + t - 1 implies -1 - frac{1}{t} + t = -1 ] Rearranging yields: [ -1 - frac{1}{t} = -1 implies frac{1}{t} = 0 implies t^2 = 1 implies t = 1 , text{or} , t = -1 ] 6. Examine ( t = -1 ): - Substituting ( (-frac{1}{2}, -1) ): [ f(-frac{1}{2} cdot -1) + f(-frac{1}{2} + (-1)) = f(-frac{1}{2}) f(-1) + f(-frac{1}{2}) + f(-1) ] This simplifies to: [ f(frac{1}{2}) + f(-frac{3}{2}) = f(-frac{1}{2})(-1) + f(-frac{1}{2}) - 1 implies f(frac{1}{2}) + f(-frac{3}{2}) = - f(-frac{1}{2}) + f(-frac{1}{2}) - 1 ] Leading to a contradiction shows ( t = -1 ) is not feasible. 7. Therefore, the valid ( t ) value is ( t = 1 ): [ f(x + 1) = f(x) + 1 ] 8. By induction, we prove ( f(n) = n ) for all integers ( n ): 1. Base case: ( f(0) = 0 ) 2. Inductive step: Assume ( f(n) = n ) for some ( n ): [ f(n + 1) = f(n) + 1 = n + 1 ] Hence, ( f ) holds for all integers. 9. Extending to rationals (mathbb{Q}): - For ( x = frac{p}{q} ) with ( p in mathbb{Z}, q in mathbb{N} ): [ f(p) + fleft(frac{p}{q} + qright) = fleft(frac{p}{q}right) f(q) + fleft(frac{p}{q}right) + f(q) ] Simplifies using ( f(q) = q ): [ p + fleft(frac{p}{q} + qright) = left(q + 1right) fleft(frac{p}{q}right) + q ] Thus: [ fleft(frac{p}{q}right) = frac{p}{q} ] 10. Extending to (mathbb{R}) via density and boundedness: - For ( x in mathbb{R} ), repeat rational arguments using density, bounded positive, and negative properties: - Finally, obtain ( f(x) = x ). # Conclusion: [ boxed{f(x) = 0 text{ or } f(x) = x} ]"},{"prompt":"The square of a number is 9.

From the information given: 1. The grandson is about as many days old as the son is in weeks. So, G_d ≈ S_w. 2. The grandson is as many months old as you are in years. So, G_m = Y_y. First, we need to find the grandson's age in days and convert it to years. Since you are 72 years old, and the grandson is as many months old as you are in years, the grandson is 72 months old. To convert the grandson's age from months to years, we divide by 12 (since there are 12 months in a year): G_y = G_m / 12 G_y = 72 / 12 G_y = 6 years old Now, we need to find the son's age. Since the grandson is about as many days old as the son is in weeks, we need to convert the grandson's age in years to days and equate it to the son's age in weeks. There are 365 days in a year (ignoring leap years for simplicity), so: G_d = G_y * 365 G_d = 6 * 365 G_d = 2190 days Since there are 7 days in a week, the son's age in weeks is approximately the same as the grandson's age in days: S_w ≈ G_d S_w ≈ 2190 To find the son's age in years, we convert weeks to years (52 weeks in a year): S_y = S_w / 52 S_y ≈ 2190 / 52 S_y ≈ 42.115...

Each integer in ( A ) has all its prime divisors less than or equal to 30. We need to show that there exist distinct integers ( a, b, c, d ) in ( A ) such that the product ( abcd ) is a perfect square. 2. **Identifying Prime Divisors**: The primes less than or equal to 30 are: [ 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29. ] There are 10 such primes. 3. **Prime Factorization Representation**: For each integer ( a ) in ( A ), we can express ( a ) in terms of these 10 primes: [ a = 2^{v_2(a)} cdot 3^{v_3(a)} cdot 5^{v_5(a)} cdot 7^{v_7(a)} cdots 29^{v_{29}(a)} ] where ( v_p(a) ) denotes the exponent of the prime ( p ) in the factorization of ( a ). 4. **Modulo 2 Exponents**: We consider the exponents ( v_p(a) ) modulo 2. For a given integer ( a ), we form a 10-tuple: [ (v_2(a) bmod 2, v_3(a) bmod 2, ldots, v_{29}(a) bmod 2) ] Each element of this tuple can be either 0 or 1, thus there are ( 2^{10} = 1024 ) possible distinct 10-tuples. 5. **Applying the Pigeonhole Principle**: Since there are 2022 integers in ( A ) and only 1024 possible 10-tuples, by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least two integers in ( A ) must share the same 10-tuple. Let’s denote these integers as ( a ) and ( b ). 6. **Product of Two Numbers with Same Tuple**: The product ( ab ) will then have all even exponents for the primes ( p ) considered: [ v_p(ab) = v_p(a) + v_p(b) ] Since ( v_p(a) ) and ( v_p(b) ) are equal modulo 2, their sum ( v_p(ab) ) must be even: [ v_p(ab) equiv v_p(a) + v_p(b) equiv 0 pmod{2} ] Thus, ( ab ) is a perfect square. 7. **Finding ( c ) and ( d )**: Remove ( a ) and ( b ) from ( A ), resulting in a set with 2020 integers. Reapplying the same reasoning, we can find two more integers ( c ) and ( d ) in this reduced set such that ( cd ) is a perfect square. 8. **Proving the Final Product**: Now, we have ( ab ) and ( cd ) as perfect squares. To prove ( abcd ) is a perfect square, consider: [ ab = k^2 quad text{and} quad cd = l^2 ] Thus, [ abcd = k^2 cdot l^2 = (kl)^2. ] Thus, ( abcd ) is indeed a perfect square. # Conclusion We have shown that there exist ( a, b, c, d ) distinct integers in ( A ) such that ( abcd ) is a perfect square.

To calculate the probability that the sum of all rolls is greater than 20, consider acceptable outcomes starting from a sum of 21 to 40. Calculating the exact probability distribution of the sum can be extensive since it involves computing combinations of occurrences of 1, 3, and 5 across eight rolls to achieve each sum. Using a combinatorial method or a probability generating function would simplify this, but detailed computation goes beyond simple probability and involves more advanced statistics or computational approaches. Without complex statistics, we get an approximate assessment by observing that sums from 21 to 40 are near or above the expected average sum of 8 times (1+3+5)/3 = 24. Thereby, assuming a roughly symmetric distribution about this mean, the probability of the sum being greater than 20 would be close to, although somewhat greater than, frac{1}{2}. Combining these two independent events gives: text{Probability} = left(frac{1}{256}right) times left(text{Probability of the sum being greater than 20}right) Assuming conservatively that mathematically it's complex to provide an exact value without more rigorous analysis, a simplified assumption could place this additional probability at about frac{1}{2}.

To prove that the sum of all natural divisors of ( n ) is divisible by 24, we will separately demonstrate that it is divisible by both 3 and 8. 3.

They can be paired such that every divisor ( d ) is paired with ( frac{n}{d} ). - When ( d equiv 1 pmod{3} ), then ( frac{n}{d} equiv 2 pmod{3} ) because: [ n equiv 2 times 1 equiv 2 pmod{3} ] - Similarly, if ( d equiv 2 pmod{3} ), then: [ frac{n}{d} equiv 2 times 2^{-1} equiv 1 pmod{3} ] - Hence, the sum inside each pair ( (d + frac{n}{d}) ) is divisible by 3. The divisors cannot be both ( equiv 2 pmod{3} ) or both ( equiv 1 pmod{3} ) because they would then form an invalid pair. Therefore, every pair adds up to a multiple of 3. 6.

A graph is bipartite if and only if it can be colored with two colors such that no two adjacent vertices share the same color. Equivalently, a graph is bipartite if and only if it contains no cycles of odd length. 3. **Cycle Analysis**: To prove that ( G ) is bipartite, we need to show that all cycles in ( G ) have even length. Consider any cycle ( mathcal{C} ) in ( G ). Traveling along each edge of ( mathcal{C} ) corresponds to crossing a line. 4. **Line Crossing Argument**: Suppose we start in a region and traverse a cycle ( mathcal{C} ), crossing lines as we move from one region to another. Each time we cross a line ( ell ), we move from one side of ( ell ) to the other. To return to the starting region, we must cross each line an even number of times. This is because crossing a line an odd number of times would leave us on the opposite side of the line, not back in the original region. 5. **Even Number of Crossings**: Since we must cross each line an even number of times to return to the starting region, the total number of line crossings (which corresponds to the number of edges in the cycle ( mathcal{C} )) must be even. Therefore, every cycle in ( G ) has an even length. 6. **Conclusion**: Since all cycles in ( G ) have even length, ( G ) is bipartite.

First, let's rewrite the equation as: frac{b}{2c - a} = frac{cos B}{cos A - 2cos C} Now, using the sine law, we have frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C}. We can rewrite the equation above in terms of sines: frac{sin B}{sin C - 2sin A} = frac{cos B}{cos A - 2cos C} By manipulating and applying the trigonometric identity sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B, we have: sin Acos B + cos Asin B = 2(sin Bcos C + sin Ccos B) Simplifying and rearranging, we obtain: sin(A + B) = 2sin(B + C) Since sin A, sin B, and sin C are all positive (as they are angles in a triangle), we can write: sin C = 2sin A Thus, frac{sin C}{sin A} = 2 (2) Now, from frac{sin C}{sin A} = 2, we can deduce that c = 2a. Given cos B = frac{1}{4}, b = 2, and c = 2a, we can use the cosine law to find a.

We have the sales for the second to sixth months, so we add those up and subtract from the total sales to find the sale in the first month: Total Sales for Month 2 to 6 = Rs. 6524 + Rs. 5689 + Rs. 7230 + Rs. 6000 + Rs. 12557 Total Sales for Month 2 to 6 = Rs. 42000 Now we subtract the known sales from the total sales: Sale in the First Month = Total Sales - Total Sales for Month 2 to 6 Sale in the First Month = Rs. 42000 - (Rs. 6524 + Rs. 5689 + Rs. 7230 + Rs. 6000 + Rs. 12557) Sale in the First Month = Rs. 42000 - Rs. 37000 Sale in the First Month = Rs. 5000 Therefore, the sale in the first month was Rs. boxed{5000} ."},{"prompt":"We consider the following operation that generates a new number from a given natural number: The given number is represented in any integer base ( b geq 2 ) such that it is a twodigit number with both digits not equal to 0.

For option B, the derivative of the function y = 4x^3 - 7 with respect to x is given by: y' = frac{d}{dx}(4x^3 - 7) = 12x^2 - 0 = 12x^2. This too does not match the given derivative, so option **B** is not correct. For option C, the derivative of the function y = x^4 - 7x - 9 with respect to x is given by: y' = frac{d}{dx}(x^4 - 7x - 9) = 4x^3 - 7 - 0 = 4x^3 - 7. However, we must apply the power rule carefully. The correct derivative for option C is: y' = frac{d}{dx}(x^4 - 7x - 9) = 4x^3 - 7 cdot 1 - 0 = 4x^3 - 7.

However, the - 7x^0 term simplifies to just -7 since x^0 = 1. Thus, the correct derivative for the option C is: y' = 4x^3 - 7. Therefore, option **C** is correct. For completeness, let’s consider option D. The derivative of the function y = x^4 - 7 with respect to x is given by: y' = frac{d}{dx}(x^4 - 7) = 4x^3 - 0 = 4x^3. This is not equal to the given derivative y' = 4x^3 - 7, so option **D** is not correct. On revisiting option C, applying the power rule properly shows that the derivative calculation for the term -7x is indeed -7 times the derivative of x^0, which is 0 (remember that the derivative of a constant is 0).

They can lie on at most two such circles, as a circle is uniquely determined by its radius and two points on its circumference (up to reflection across the line through these two points). 4. **Counting Circle Intersections**: - If we have (g) green points, we can choose pairs of green points in (binom{g}{2}) ways. - Each pair of green points can determine at most two black points (since each pair can lie on at most two circles). - Hence, the maximum number of black points (b) can be given by: [ b leq 2 cdot binom{g}{2} ] - Recall that (binom{g}{2}) represents the number of ways to choose 2 points from (g) points, and it is calculated as follows: [ binom{g}{2} = frac{g(g-1)}{2} ] - Therefore, the inequality becomes: [ b leq 2 cdot frac{g(g-1)}{2} = g(g-1) ] 5. **Finding the Minimum Number of Green Points**: - Since there are a total of 2020 points (2020 points in total, meaning (b + g = 2020)), we need to solve for (g) such that the number of black points (b) is maximized while ensuring: [ g(g-1) geq b ] - Given (g + b = 2020), we can substitute and solve for (g): [ g(g-1) geq 2020 - g ] [ g^2 - g geq 2020 - g ] [ g^2 - 2g geq 2020 ] [ g^2 - 2g - 2020 geq 0 ] - Solving the quadratic inequality using the quadratic formula (g = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}): [ g = frac{2 pm sqrt{4 + 4 cdot 2020}}{2} ] [ g = frac{2 pm sqrt{8084}}{2} ] [ g = frac{2 pm 89.88}{2} ] [ approx 45.94 ] - Since (g) must be an integer, and we are looking for the smallest possible number of green points: [ g geq 46 ] Conclusion: The minimum number of green points is 45 is incorrect. Based on the above calculation, the minimum number of green points correctly calculated is (boxed{46})."},{"prompt":"The mean (average) of 8, 15, and 21 is equal to the mean (average) of 14, y, and z. What are the values of y and z?","completion":"The mean of 8, 15, and 21 is calculated as: frac{8 + 15 + 21}{3} = frac{44}{3}. Since the mean of 14, y, and z must also be frac{44}{3}, we know: frac{14 + y + z}{3} = frac{44}{3}. Thus, the sum of 14, y, and z must be: 14 + y + z = 44. Rearranging gives: y + z = 44 - 14, y + z = 30. At this point, without additional information, there are infinite solutions for y and z that satisfy y + z = 30. If we specify an additional condition, such as y = z, then: y + y = 30, 2y = 30, y = 15. So, z = 15, giving the solution as y = 15 and z = 15 with: boxed{y = 15, z = 15}."},{"prompt":"Given two parallel lines.

Let the distance between e and f be denoted as d. 3. **Determine the Locus of C:** - The segment AB can be considered as being drawn through point P at any arbitrary slope. Let’s denote this line as g. 4. **Identify the Condition for C:** - The triangle ABC is constructed such that one of its sides, say AC or BC or AB, is perpendicular to the given parallel lines e and f, and this side equals the altitude of the triangle from C to AB. 5. **Moving Along Perpendicular Directions:** - Imagine lines a and b perpendicular to e and f respectively. a passing through A, and b passing through B. - The coordinates of point C should lie either on line a at a distance d from A or on line b at a distance d from B. 6. **Points of C:** - Therefore, C can be at one of four points: C_1, C_2, C_3, or C_4 where: - C_1 and C_2 are at a distance d from A on line a. - C_3 and C_4 are at a distance d from B on line b. 7. **Proof of Location Independence:** - The geometric place of points C will stay fixed as the perpendicular directions from e and f do not change with the movement of A and B, as long as P remains the midpoint. - Denote projection of P onto e and f as Q and R respectively. - The intersections of lines like QR_1, QR_2, RQ_1, and RQ_2 are crucial. 8. **Conclusion Explanation:** - For any arbitrary selection of g passing through P, points C_1, C_2, C_3, and C_4 remain fixed. - Thus, the locus of point C forms the union of the lines QR_1, QR_2, RQ_1, and RQ_2, except for points Q and R which are defined relative to the midpoint of AB. # Conclusion: [ boxed{C} text{ lies on the lines } QR_1, QR_2, RQ_1, text{ and } RQ_2 text{ except } Q text{ and } R. ]"},{"prompt":"There are 500 students in a local high school. 40 percent are juniors. 70 percent of juniors are involved in sports.

For each point, the 22 nearest points are termed its \\"neighbors.\\" We are asked to determine the maximum number of points for which a given point can be a neighbor. Step-by-step Solution: 1. **Understanding the Definition**: - If point ( M ) is a \\"neighbor\\" of point ( N ), then ( M ) must be within the smallest 22 distances from ( N ). - This implies point ( M ) is within the circle centered at ( N ) with the radius being the distance to the 22nd closest point to ( N ). 2. **Minimum Distance Coverage**: - For any point ( P ), we ask how many other points can consider ( P ) one of their nearest 22 points. - We use the fact that each point must \\"cover\\" as many other points as possible with their circle as defined above. 3. **Avoiding Overlap**: - Points closer than a certain radius from ( P ) might already be covered by another surrounding circle, particularly if the point lies inside multiple such circles. - To avoid redundancy, it is ideal to distribute the circles in such a manner that each point ( P ) is only counted once as a neighbor by the most significant points within these 2015 points. 4. **Strategy for Maximum Count**: - Start by considering how many points can be covered considering the point ( P ) within the circles drawn by the other points. - Suppose each circle carries exactly 22 points on the threshold. We want to estimate the maximum number such circles to optimally include ( P ) in consideration without minimal overlap. 5. **Counting the Maximum Neighbors**: - Therefore, to avoid duplication, the point ( P ) can be neighbor to maximum ( frac{2015 - 1}{22} ) points effectively. - This simplification addresses ( P )'s coverage and optimal non-overlapping strategy under combinatorial consideration: [ frac{2014}{22} approx 91.09 ] 6. **Conclusion**: - Rounding down since we have discrete points, maximum 'neighbor' count for any point ( P ) can be deduced as: [ boxed{91} ]"},{"prompt":"a < 0 is a condition for the equation ax^{2}+2x+1=0 to have at least one negative root.

The volume of water displaced by the toy car is equal to the volume of the toy car itself: Volume of toy car = Area of base of tank * Increase in water height due to toy car = (44 cm * 35 cm) * 3 cm = 1540 cm² * 3 cm = 4620 cm³ Now, to find the sum of the volumes of the toy train and the car, we simply add the two volumes together: Sum of volumes = Volume of toy train + Volume of toy car = 10780 cm³ + 4620 cm³ = 15400 cm³ Therefore, the sum of the volumes of the toy train and the car is boxed{15400} cm³."},{"prompt":"Given a=(frac{1}{2})^{frac{1}{3}}, b=log_{2}frac{1}{3}, and c=log_{2}3, determine the correct relationship among a, b, and c.

For ( n geq 3 ), we have: [ g(n+1) = 3g(n) + g(n-1) ] This can be derived by considering the constraints on the digits and the sum of neighboring digits. 3. **Extend the recurrence relation:** Using the established recurrence relation, we can find: [ g(n+2) = 3g(n+1) + g(n) = 3(3g(n) + g(n-1)) + g(n) = 10g(n) + 3g(n-1) ] [ g(n+3) = 3g(n+2) + g(n+1) = 3(10g(n) + 3g(n-1)) + (3g(n) + g(n-1)) = 33g(n) + 10g(n-1) ] 4. **Modulo 11 simplification:** We simplify the recurrence relation modulo 11: [ g(n+3) equiv 33g(n) + 10g(n-1) pmod{11} ] Since ( 33 equiv 0 pmod{11} ) and ( 10 equiv -1 pmod{11} ), we get: [ g(n+3) equiv -g(n-1) pmod{11} ] 5. **Establish periodicity:** We can further extend this to show periodicity: [ g(n+6) equiv g(n) pmod{11} ] This is because: [ g(n+6) = g((n+3)+3) equiv -g(n+2) equiv -(-g(n-1)) = g(n-1) pmod{11} ] [ g(n+6) equiv g(n) pmod{11} ] 6. **Calculate specific values:** We need to find ( g(2010) ) and ( g(2011) ) modulo 11.

Assume that all the points ( q_1, q_2, q_3, q_4 ) have distinct ( x )-coordinates. 2. Let ( q_i = (x_i, y_i) ) for ( 1 leq i leq 4 ).

We can do this by connecting the midpoints of the sides of the original triangle, which results in 4 smaller triangles inside the larger one. For example, let's call the original equilateral triangle ( triangle ABC ). If we denote the midpoints of sides ( AB ), ( BC ), and ( CA ) as ( M ), ( N ), and ( O ) respectively, then connecting ( M ) to ( N ), ( N ) to ( O ), and ( O ) to ( M ) splits ( triangle ABC ) into four smaller equilateral triangles. 5. **Step 5: Verifying the maximum distance within each region:** Each of these smaller equilateral triangles has a side length of 0.5 units. The maximum distance between any two points within one of these triangles is the length of a side of the smaller triangles, which is 0.5 units. 6. **Step 6: Applying the pigeonhole principle:** Since we have divided the original triangle into 4 smaller triangles (regions) and we need to place 5 points in total: - 4 regions (pigeonholes) - 5 points (pigeons) By the pigeonhole principle, when placing 5 points in these 4 regions, at least one of the regions must contain at least 2 points. 7. **Step 7: Conclusion:** In this region, as we showed in Step 5, the maximum possible distance between any two points is 0.5 units.

The equation provided is cos alpha - sqrt{3} sin alpha = -frac{22}{13}. **Step 1: Transformation of the given equation** We can transform the given equation into a form that involves the cosine of a sum of angles. This is done by recognizing that cos alpha - sqrt{3} sin alpha can be rewritten using the identity for cos(alpha + beta), where beta = frac{pi}{3}. Thus, we have: [2cos (alpha + frac{pi}{3}) = -frac{22}{13}] which simplifies to: [cos (alpha + frac{pi}{3}) = -frac{11}{13}] **Step 2: Determining the value of sin (alpha + frac{pi}{3})** Given that cos (alpha + frac{pi}{3}) = -frac{11}{13}, we find sin (alpha + frac{pi}{3}) using the Pythagorean identity sin^2 theta + cos^2 theta = 1.

This symmetrical placement ensures that: - The coin is within the large circle. - The coin does not touch any previously placed coin directly except at the edge, which is permissible. 4. **Inevitable Result**: - Since A and B alternate turns, and A plays symmetrically - both players should theoretically run out of valid moves simultaneously. - Because A started, whenever B cannot make a move, it implies A already took the last move valid or forced B to have no space left. 5. **Conclusion**: - Therefore, the symmetric strategy ensures that A will always have a move if B has and can thereby force a win.

However, due to pests and bad weather conditions, you lose 5 percent of the total yield after every harvest. How many sacks of rice are you able to collect in total after the first three harvests?","completion":"Let's calculate the number of sacks of rice you are able to collect after each harvest, taking into account the increase in yield and the loss due to pests and bad weather. Initial harvest: You start with 20 sacks of rice. First harvest: The yield increases by 15 percent, so you get an additional 15/100 * 20 = 3 sacks. So, after the first increase, you have 20 + 3 = 23 sacks. But then you lose 5 percent due to pests and bad weather, which is 5/100 * 23 = 1.15 sacks. So, after the first harvest, you have 23 - 1.15 = 21.85 sacks. Second harvest: The yield increases by 20 percent, so you get an additional 20/100 * 21.85 = 4.37 sacks. So, after the second increase, you have 21.85 + 4.37 = 26.22 sacks. But then you lose 5 percent due to pests and bad weather, which is 5/100 * 26.22 = 1.311 sacks. So, after the second harvest, you have 26.22 - 1.311 = 24.909 sacks. Third harvest: We don't have the percentage increase for the third harvest, so let's assume it remains constant at the last known increase rate, which is 20 percent. The yield increases by 20 percent, so you get an additional 20/100 * 24.909 = 4.9818 sacks. So, after the third increase, you have 24.909 + 4.9818 = 29.8908 sacks. But then you lose 5 percent due to pests and bad weather, which is 5/100 * 29.8908 = 1.49454 sacks. So, after the third harvest, you have 29.8908 - 1.49454 = 28.39626 sacks. Now, let's add up the sacks from each harvest: Initial harvest: 20 sacks After first harvest: 21.85 sacks After second harvest: 24.909 sacks After third harvest: 28.39626 sacks Total sacks collected after three harvests = 20 + 21.85 + 24.909 + 28.39626 = 95.15526 sacks Since you can't have a fraction of a sack, we'll round down to the nearest whole number: Total sacks collected after three harvests = boxed{95} sacks."},{"prompt":"The graphs of a quadratic polynomial and its derivative divide the coordinate plane into four parts. How many roots does this quadratic polynomial have?","completion":"To determine the number of roots of the given quadratic trinomial, let's consider the following steps: 1. **Identify Functions:** Let us consider the quadratic function: [ y = ax^2 + bx + c ] and its derivative: [ y' = 2ax + b. ] 2. **Analyze the Derivative:** The derivative y' = 2ax + b is a linear equation which represents a straight line. 3. **Intersection of Functions:** We need to consider whether the parabola and the straight line (the derivative) intersect. If they do intersect, it must be determined how many regions they divide the coordinate plane into. If the graphs intersect in two points, they divide the plane into four regions, as per the problem statement. 4. **Intersection Points:** To find the points where these graphs intersect, solve the system of equations: [ ax^2 + bx + c = 2ax + b. ] Simplify this to get: [ ax^2 + bx + c - 2ax - b = 0, ] which simplifies to: [ ax^2 - ax + c - b = 0. ] 5. **Discriminant Calculation:** To determine the nature of the roots of the quadratic equation, compute the discriminant ((D)): [ D = (b - 2a)^2 - 4ac. ] Simplifies further to: [ D = b^2 - 4ac + 4a^2 - 4a(b - c) = b^2 - 4ac + 4a^2 - 4ab + 4ac, ] which then simplifies to: [ D = b^2 - 4ac + 4a^2 - 4ab + 4ac = b^2 + 4a^2 - 4ab = (b - 2a)^2. ] 6. **Discriminant Analysis:** If (D = 0), it means they are tangent, intersecting at exactly one point. If (D > 0), the quadratic function has two distinct real roots, meaning there would be two points of intersection. 7. **Concluding the Roots:** However, the problem asserts they divide the coordinate plane into four parts, hence: [ (b^2 - 4ac < 0), ] which means the parabola does not intersect the x-axis. Thus, the quadratic function (ax^2 + bx + c = 0) has no real roots. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{No roots}} ]"},{"prompt":"There are two airlines A and B and finitely many airports.

For a = 5 and b = 13: [ 5 times 13 - 1 = 65 - 1 = 64 = 8^2 quad (text{Perfect Square}) ] This verification yields three perfect squares from existing pairs. The total possible combinations of a,b with these four numbers is binom{4}{2} = 6. Step 2: Proof by Contradiction for d Let's assume the integers 2d-1, 5d-1, and 13d-1 are all perfect squares. 1. Assume 2d - 1 = x^2 for positive integer x. Since 2d - 1 must be odd (as 2 is even and d is an integer), x must be odd. Let x = 2n-1 where n is a positive integer: [ 2d - 1 = (2n-1)^2 ] [ 2d - 1 = 4n^2 - 4n + 1 ] Solving for d: [ 2d = 4n^2 - 4n + 2 ] [ d = 2n^2 - 2n + 1 ] This implies d is odd because it is expressed as 2(text{integer}) + 1. 2. Assume 5d - 1 = y^2 for positive integer y. Since d is odd, 5d - 1 must be even, implying y is even. Let y = 2p where p is a positive integer: [ 5d - 1 = (2p)^2 ] [ 5d - 1 = 4p^2 ] Solving for d: [ 5d = 4p^2 + 1 ] This implies: [ d = frac{4p^2 + 1}{5} ] Since d is odd, the numerator 4p^2 + 1 must also be odd, making d an odd integer when divided by 5, which must also hold consistently across steps. 3. Assume 13d - 1 = z^2 for positive integer z. Using similar logic as above, 13d - 1 must result in z being even. Let z = 2q where q is a positive integer: [ 13d - 1 = (2q)^2 ] [ 13d - 1 = 4q^2 ] Solving for d: [ 13d = 4q^2 + 1 ] This implies: [ d = frac{4q^2 + 1}{13} ] Again, d is an odd integer when divided. Step 3: Combining Cases Combine expressions: [ d = 2n^2 - 2n + 1 ] [ d = frac{4p^2 + 1}{5} ] [ d = frac{4q^2 + 1}{13} ] Given d is odd, comparing those integer requirements would suggest p, ( q ) and the same integer n must follow the specific integers, causing contradictions across multiple setup equality conditions.

First, let's establish the existence of such a tetrahedron by considering two perpendicular edges of lengths (a) and (b). The tetrahedron has a square cross-section of side length (frac{ab}{a+b}). 2. We will split the remaining four edges proportionally using a ratio (k:(1-k)) from the common endpoint of the edge of length (b). 3. Connecting these points will form a parallelogram with side lengths (ka) and ((1-k)b). 4. This parallelogram must be a rectangle due to the geometry of the tetrahedron. According to Thales' theorem (parallel sides of the rectangle are parallel to two perpendicular edges of the tetrahedron), we can calculate (k). Since the rectangle's adjacent sides must be equal: [ ka = (1-k)b Rightarrow k(a + b) = b Rightarrow k = frac{b}{a+b} ] Thus, the side length of the square cross-section is obtained as: [ frac{ab}{a+b} ] 5. Now consider two sets of perpendicular lines intersecting at a point (O), with segments (OA=1), (OB=1), and (OC=x) (where (x) is a parameter). 6. In the tetrahedron (OABC) where axes (OC perp) plane (AOB) implies (OC perp AB). Similarly, (OA perp BC) and (OB perp AC). By choosing a parameter (x>0), we can construct a square with one side 100 times larger than another. 7. Considering the mutual perpendicular segments (OC) and (AB) with lengths (x) and (sqrt{2}), the side length of the square slice is given by: [ c_1(x) = frac{sqrt{2} x}{sqrt{2} + x} ] 8. Similarly, for segments of lengths (1) and (sqrt{x^2+1}), the side length of the square slice is: [ c_2(x) = frac{sqrt{x^2 + 1}}{sqrt{x^2 + 1} + 1} ] 9. Considering the function (f(x) = frac{c_2(x)}{c_1(x)}), it is clear that (f(x)) is continuous for (x>0) and (f(1)=1). Since (c_2(x) > frac{1}{2}), [ f(x) > frac{x + sqrt{2}}{2 sqrt{2} x} > frac{1}{2x} ] Thus, [ fleft(frac{1}{200}right) > 100 ] 10.

Given (x'), construct the tetrahedron (OABC) such that the sides yield the required proportions, and the resulting tetrahedron will satisfy the condition of producing square slices of dimensions (100 times 100) and (1 times 1). Hence, such a tetrahedron exists. boxed{text{Exists}}"},{"prompt":"A sports retailer ordered white and yellow tennis balls in equal number but the dispatch clerk of the tennis ball company erred and dispatched 20 extra yellow balls, making the ratio of white balls to yellow balls 8 / 13.

This means that for every 8 white balls, there are 13 yellow balls after the error. We can set up the following proportion to represent this ratio: W / (Y + 20) = 8 / 13 Since W = Y, we can substitute Y for W: Y / (Y + 20) = 8 / 13 Now, we can cross-multiply to solve for Y: 13Y = 8(Y + 20) Expanding the equation: 13Y = 8Y + 160 Subtract 8Y from both sides: 13Y - 8Y = 160 5Y = 160 Divide both sides by 5: Y = 160 / 5 Y = 32 Since the original number of white balls (W) is equal to the original number of yellow balls (Y), the retailer originally ordered 32 white balls and 32 yellow balls.

A: frac{1}{4} B: frac{1}{5} C: frac{1}{6} D: frac{1}{8}","completion":"To solve this problem, we'll break down the solution into detailed steps: 1. **Calculate the total number of ways the 4 students can join the clubs**: Since there are 4 clubs and each club can accept one more student, and we have 4 students, each student has 4 choices. This situation is a permutation of 4 distinct objects taken 4 at a time. The formula for permutations is P(n, k) = frac{n!}{(n-k)!}. Here, n=k=4, so we have P(4, 4) = frac{4!}{(4-4)!} = frac{4!}{0!} = 4! = 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 24. So, there are 24 ways for the 4 students to join the clubs. 2. **Calculate the number of ways A joins the street dance club and B joins either the calligraphy club or the photography club**: - First, A joins the street dance club. This is a specific condition, so it doesn't add to the number of ways since A's choice is fixed. - Second, B has the option to join either the calligraphy club or the photography club. This is a combination problem where B has 2 options (calligraphy or photography), and we are choosing 1. The formula for combinations is C(n, k) = frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}. Here, n=2 (two clubs) and k=1 (choosing one), so we have C(2, 1) = frac{2!}{1!(2-1)!} = 2. - Third, the remaining 2 students (not A or B) can join the remaining 2 clubs in 2! = 2 times 1 = 2 ways. - Multiplying these together, we get the total number of favorable outcomes as 1 times C(2, 1) times 2! = 1 times 2 times 2 = 4. 3. **Calculate the probability**: The probability is the number of favorable outcomes divided by the total number of outcomes.

This means the function is monotonically decreasing for all real numbers x. - Thus, option B is incorrect as it does not satisfy the condition of being monotonically increasing on left(0,+infty right). **Option C: y=-frac{1}{x}** - The derivative of y=-frac{1}{x} is frac{1}{x^2}, which is positive for all x > 0. This indicates that y=-frac{1}{x} is monotonically increasing on left(0,+infty right). - Therefore, option C satisfies the condition and is correct. **Option D: y=x^{2}-x** - The derivative of y=x^{2}-x is 2x-1. Setting 2x-1=0 gives x=frac{1}{2}. This means the function has a critical point at x=frac{1}{2}. - For x < frac{1}{2}, the derivative is negative, indicating the function is monotonically decreasing. For x > frac{1}{2}, the derivative is positive, indicating the function is monotonically increasing. - Since the function is not monotonically increasing for all x in the interval left(0,+infty right), option D is incorrect.

How many total flavors can IceCream Universe create by combining four scoops, where any mixture of the four scoops counts as a flavor?","completion":"Now we have 4 basic flavors and 4 indistinguishable scoops. We again use a \\"balls and sticks\\" methodology. Instead of 3 boxes for flavors, as in the original problem, we now set up 4 boxes to represent chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, and mint. To determine the number of ways the 4 indistinguishable scoops (balls) can be distributed among the 4 distinguishable boxes (flavors), we calculate this as a combination of placing partition dividers (sticks) among the scoops. With 4 flavors, we need 3 dividers (one fewer than the number of boxes). Thus, the arrangement is of 4 balls + 3 sticks = 7 total items, and we choose spots for the 3 sticks (or conversely, the 4 scoops). Therefore, the count of unique combinations is computed as: [ binom{7}{3} = frac{7 times 6 times 5}{3 times 2 times 1} = 35 ] Conclusion: [ boxed{35} ] The calculations clearly demonstrate that 35 unique flavor combinations are possible when 4 basic flavors are blended in combinations of four scoops each."},{"prompt":"Three people, Atkins, Brown, and Cranby, decided to go on a small trip.

Given that we have 50 odd and 49 even numbers, when an odd number ( x ) is written on one side, the number ( y ) on the opposite side must be either odd or even. - Since ( x ) is odd and the total range includes 50 odd numbers (among 99), then the pairing of numbers ensures some useful properties. 4. Calculation of summations: - The sum of an odd number and an odd number results in an even number: ( text{odd} + text{odd} = text{even} ). - The sum of an odd number and an even number results in an odd number: ( text{odd} + text{even} = text{odd} ). 5. Analyzing card pairs: - If a card has an odd number on one side, say ( k ), and if the other side also contains another odd number, the sum ( k + j ) (where ( j ) is odd) will be even. - There are 50 cards with one of their sides labeled with an odd number.

The time it takes for the clock to tick is the time between the first tick and the last tick. However, there is no tick for the zeroth second; the first tick happens at the end of the first second. So, for example, at 1 o'clock, there is only one tick, and it takes no time at all from the first to the last tick because there is only one tick. At 2 o'clock, there are two ticks, and the time between the first and the last tick is the time it takes for one interval between ticks. At 8 o'clock, the clock ticks 8 times. The time between the first and last ticks is 42 seconds. This means there are 7 intervals between the 8 ticks (since the first tick does not count as an interval). So each interval between ticks is 42 seconds divided by 7 intervals, which is 6 seconds per interval. Now, let's consider the certain time when the time between the first and last ticks was 30 seconds. If each interval is 6 seconds, then the number of intervals in 30 seconds is 30 seconds divided by 6 seconds per interval, which is 5 intervals.

Method 1: By choosing m = 0, -1, 1, we get three vertex coordinates: P_1(-1, 0), P_2(0, 2), P_3(-2, -4). The equation of the parabola passing through these three points is y = -x^2 + x + 2.

The standard period of sin(x) is 2π, so the period of sin(2x), and thus f(x), is frac{2π}{2} = π. - For f(x+pi), we calculate f(x+pi) = sin[2(x+pi) - frac{π}{3}] = sin(2x + 2π - frac{π}{3}). Since sin(x) is 2π periodic, adding 2π inside the sine does not change its period. Therefore, the period remains π. - This shows that option A, which claims the period is frac{π}{2}, is incorrect. **Option B:** - To find the zero point of f(x+pi), we set f(x+pi) = 0 and solve for x. - Substituting x = frac{π}{6} into f(x+pi), we get fleft(frac{π}{6}+piright) = sinleft(2cdotfrac{π}{6} - frac{π}{3}right) = sin(0) = 0. - This confirms that frac{π}{6} is a zero point of f(x+pi), making option B correct. **Option C:** - The function f(x) = sin(2x - frac{π}{3}) can be rewritten as sin 2(x - frac{π}{6}), indicating a horizontal shift. - This means the graph of y = f(x) is obtained by shifting y = sin 2x to the right by frac{π}{6} units, not frac{π}{3}. - Therefore, option C is incorrect because it misstates the shift amount. **Option D:** - To check symmetry about x = frac{3π}{2}, we evaluate f(frac{3π}{2}) = sin(3π - frac{π}{3}) = sin(frac{8π}{3} - frac{π}{3}) = sin(frac{7π}{3}). - Since sin(frac{7π}{3}) is equivalent to sin(frac{π}{3}) due to the periodic nature of sine, and sin(frac{π}{3}) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, it does not imply symmetry about x = frac{3π}{2}. - Thus, option D is incorrect because it does not correctly describe the symmetry of the graph.

The quadratic equation is given by: [ x^2 + px + q = 0 ] 2. Let the roots of this equation be ( alpha ) and ( beta ). 3. According to Vieta's formulas, the sum and product of the roots are related to the coefficients of the quadratic equation. Specifically, for an equation of the form ( x^2 + px + q = 0 ): - The sum of the roots ( alpha + beta ) is given by the coefficient of ( x ) with opposite sign: [ alpha + beta = -p ] - The product of the roots ( alpha beta ) is given by the constant term ( q ): [ alpha beta = q ] 4. These relationships reveal that the functions involving the roots ( alpha ) and ( beta ) are symmetrical functions of the roots.

By the definition of an ellipse, M lies on an ellipse with foci F_1 and F_2, where a = 2 and c = 1. Therefore, b^2 = a^2 - c^2 = 3. The equation of the trajectory L of the moving circle's center M is frac{x^2}{4} + frac{y^2}{3} = 1. (2) Let A(x_1, y_1) and B(x_2, y_2) with y_1 > 0 and y_2 < 0.

The problem states that the 2 letters must be different. This is a permutation problem because the order in which we choose the letters matters (e.g., \\"AB\\" is different from \\"BA\\").

Therefore, option A is incorrect. - **Option B**: A parallelogram with equal diagonals is a square. - This statement is also incorrect. While a square is a specific type of parallelogram with equal diagonals, not all parallelograms with equal diagonals are squares. A parallelogram with perpendicular, bisecting, and equal diagonals is a square. However, equal diagonals alone do not imply perpendicularity or bisecting, which are necessary conditions for a parallelogram to be a square. Thus, option B is incorrect. - **Option C**: A quadrilateral with perpendicular diagonals is a rhombus. - This statement is not entirely accurate. A rhombus does have perpendicular diagonals, but the key characteristic of a rhombus is that all four sides are of equal length. A quadrilateral with perpendicular and bisecting diagonals is a rhombus. The condition about the diagonals being perpendicular alone is insufficient to conclude that a quadrilateral is a rhombus without the additional property of bisecting diagonals. Therefore, option C is incorrect. - **Option D**: A quadrilateral with four equal angles is a rectangle. - This statement is correct. By definition, a rectangle is a parallelogram with four right angles. If a quadrilateral has four equal angles, and since the sum of the angles in any quadrilateral is 360^circ, each of these angles must be 90^circ. Thus, a quadrilateral with four equal angles is indeed a rectangle, making option D the correct choice.

The side ( AB ) is on the xaxis. Given that the distances from point ( Q(0,1) ) to the lines ( AC ) and ( BC ) are both 1, find the minimum area of ( triangle ABC ).","completion":"To find the minimum area of triangle ABC with constraints involving the coordinates of point C(x,y), we need to go through this systematically. We are given that point C satisfies x^2 + y^2 leq 8 + 2y and y geq 3, and we know point Q(0,1) lies on the perpendicular bisector of AC and BC, and is also 1 unit away from both lines AC and BC. Here's a step-by-step solution: 1. **Translate the Inequality**: From x^2 + y^2 leq 8 + 2y, we complete the square in the y-term: [ x^2 + y^2 leq 8 + 2y implies x^2 + (y^2 - 2y) leq 8 implies x^2 + (y - 1)^2 leq 9 ] This means that C(x, y) is inside (or on) the circle centered at (0,1) with radius 3. Also, y geq 3, which implies C is in the upper semi-disk. 2. **Equation of AC and Distance from Q to AC**: Let’s assume points A(a_1, 0) and B(a_2, 0) on the x-axis. The line AC has an equation: [ y = frac{y_0}{x_0 - a_1}(x - a_1) ] The distance from point Q(0,1) to line AC can be found using the distance formula: [ d = frac{|y_0 - a_1|}{sqrt{(x_0 - a_1)^2 + y_0^2}} = 1 ] Simplifying, we get: [ (y_0 - 1) x_1 - a_1 y_0 + y_0 a_1 = 0 implies frac{|x_0 - a_1 - a_1 y_0|}{sqrt{(x_0 - a_1)^2 + y_0^2}} = 1 ] 3. **Using Quadratic Roots**: Given distance constraints, the quadratic equations for a_1 and a_2 will be formed similarly: [ (y_0 - 2) a_1^2 + 2x_0 a_1 - y_0 = 0 ] [ (y_0 - 2) a_2^2 + 2x_0 a_2 - y_0 = 0 ] Solving these quadratic equations directly is non-trivial. We use the sum and product of roots properties: [ sum a_1 + a_2 = frac{-2x_0}{y_0 - 2} ] [ a_1 a_2 = frac{y_0}{y_0 - 2} ] 4. **Length of AB**: Using the roots, |AB| can be simplified as: [ |AB|^2 = (a_1 - a_2)^2 = (a_1 + a_2)^2 - 4a_1 a_2 = frac{[2x_0]^2}{y_0 - 2} - frac{4y_0}{y_0 - 2} ] [ |AB|^2 = frac{4(x_0^2 - y_0(y_0 - 2))}{(y_0 - 2)^2} ] 5. **Maximize |AB| and Area**: For maximum |AB|, given x_0^2 + y_0(y_0 - 2) = 8, the semicircle where y_0 in [3, 4]: [ 1 implies Rightarrow |AB| = frac{4sqrt{2}}{y_0 - 2}, text{ maximum at } y_0 = 3 ] Hence, the area A: [ A = frac{1}{2} times y_0 times frac{4 sqrt{2}}{y_0 - 2} = 2 sqrt{2}(1 + frac{2}{y_0 - 2}) ] On substitution: [ A_{max} = 2 sqrt{2}(1 + 2) = 6 sqrt{2} ] Conclusion.

Let's denote the probability that neither A, B, nor C occurs as P(neither A nor B nor C).

To find the minimum value of frac{2}{a} + frac{1}{3b}, we manipulate the expression by multiplying it by (3a + 2b), which equals 2 based on the expected value equation: [ frac{2}{a} + frac{1}{3b} = frac{1}{2} left( frac{2}{a} + frac{1}{3b} right) (3a + 2b) ] Expanding this, we get: [ = frac{1}{2} left( 6 + frac{4b}{a} + frac{a}{b} + frac{2}{3} right) ] Applying the AM-GM inequality, where the arithmetic mean is greater than or equal to the geometric mean, to the terms frac{4b}{a} and frac{a}{b}, we have: [ frac{1}{2} left( 2sqrt{frac{4b}{a} cdot frac{a}{b}} + 6 + frac{2}{3} right) = frac{1}{2} left( 4 + 6 + frac{2}{3} right) = frac{16}{3} ] Therefore, the minimum value of frac{2}{a} + frac{1}{3b} is achieved when frac{4b}{a} = frac{a}{b}, leading to b = frac{1}{4} and a = frac{1}{2}.

Notice that the difference gives us: [ begin{aligned} f(a_{i+1}) - f(a_i) &= L(12a_{i+6}) - L(2(a_i + a_{i+1} + a_{i+2} + a_{i+3} + a_{i+4} + a_{i+5})). end{aligned} ] 6.

Since ( f(a_{i+1}) - f(a_i) = 0 ), this implies that ( f(a_i) ) is a constant value. 8. Verify whether this constant holds true starting from the first terms: [ f(a_1) = L(2 + 6 + 10) = L(18) = 8 ] 9. If the sequence exhibited a repeating pattern of (0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1), then [ begin{aligned} a_j &= 0, a_{j+1}=1, a_{j+2}=0, a_{j+3}=1, a_{j+4}=0, a_{j+5}=1, end{aligned} ] 10. Then, [ begin{aligned} f(a_j) &= L(2 cdot 0 + 4 cdot 1 + 6 cdot 0 + 8 cdot 1 + 10 cdot 0 + 12 cdot 1) &= L(4 + 8 + 12) = L(24) = 4 end{aligned} ] 11. The sequence (0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1) results in (f(a_j) = 4), which contradicts the constant value (8). Thus, the initial claim that the sequence doesn’t exhibit the pattern (0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1) is proven true. 12. **Conclusion**: The sequence does not show the pattern (0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1) repeatedly.

After that, the magician makes his first appearance, observes the circle on the blackboard, and indicates the semicircle where the erased point was located. To ensure the magician can correctly identify the location, what agreement should the magician and the assistant make in advance?","completion":"1. **Initial Setup**: - We start by considering a circle on a blackboard, marked with 2007 distinct points. These points divide the circumference into 2007 arcs. At this moment, the magician is not present. 2. **Erase a Point**: - The magician's assistant erases one of the points. Thus, there are now 2006 points remaining on the circle, and therefore, the circle is divided into 2006 arcs. 3. **Identifying the Longest Arc**: - Before erasing a point, consider the circle divided into 2007 arcs. Define ( overarc{AB} ) as the longest arc among these 2007 arcs. If multiple longest arcs exist, select any one of them. We will choose arc ( overarc{AB} ) such that it is oriented clockwise from point ( A ) (i.e., point ( B ) follows point ( A ) in a clockwise direction). 4. **Erase Specific Point ( A )**: - The assistant erases point ( A ). Consequently, the number of points on the circle is reduced to 2006, thus creating 2006 new arcs. Notably, one of these arcs would now be the continuation from point ( C ) (adjacent point to ( A )) to point ( B ). 5. **Magician's Observation**: - When the magician examines the circle, they observe the new division into 2006 arcs. The crucial observation is that the point ( A ) that was erased would cause the previously longest arc ( overarc{AB} ) to grow even longer, making the arc ( overarc{CB} ) longer than any other arc on the circle. 6. **Detecting the Erased Point**: - Let the longest current arc be ( overarc{CB} ) with ( C ) and ( B ) being the adjacent points. The point ( C ) and ( B ) would be the points around ( A ). Consequently, if ( X ) is the midpoint of arc ( overarc{CB} ), then the erased point ( A ) should be located such that it lies on the arc ( overarc{CX} ). 7. **Conclusion**: - The erased point ( A ) must be within the larger segment formed by arc ( overarc{CB} ). Hence, the magician can determine that the erased point ( A ) is in the clockwise direction of point ( C ). Given the above procedure, the magician is always able to point out the semicircle that contains the erased point with the knowledge of the longest arc created by the removal. Hence, this concludes the solution and the magician's correct prediction strategy. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"The line l is symmetric to the line 3x y + 2 = 0 with respect to the yaxis.

First, let's consider a counterexample to test the sufficiency of condition A for condition B. If we choose a_{1} = -1 and q = 1, then the sequence becomes {a_{n}} = -1, -1, -1, ldots. The sum of the first n terms, S_{n}, is calculated as S_{n} = na_{1} = -n.

We need to show that (PA cdot PB = PC cdot PD). To solve this problem, we will use the power of a point theorem. Here is the step-by-step detailed proof: 1. **Identify the Triangles:** The lines (AB) and (CD) intersect at (P). Hence, we have two pairs of intersecting chords: (PA) and (PB), and (PC) and (PD). 2. **Use the Power of a Point Theorem:** The power of a point theorem states that for a point (P) outside or inside a circle, the products of the lengths of the segments of intersecting chords through (P) are equal. Therefore, (P) on the circle segment intersection gives: [ PA cdot PB = PC cdot PD ] 3. **Establish Similarity of Triangles:** Consider the intersecting chords theorem, which is a special case of the power of a point. For point (P), that creates two intersecting segments (PA, PB) and (PC, PD). The triangles (triangle PCA) and (triangle PBD) are similar by the Angle-Angle (AA) criterion due to the following angle properties: - (angle PCA = angle PBD) since they trace equal arcs subtending these angles (both being equal to the angles at the alternate segments of the circle). - (angle ACP = angle BDP) being opposite angles at the point of intersection. 4. **Set Up the Proportionality:** Since (triangle PCA sim triangle PBD), we have: [ frac{PC}{PA} = frac{PB}{PD} ] 5. **Cross-Multiply to Solve the Proportion:** Cross-multiplying the above proportion, we get: [ PC cdot PD = PA cdot PB ] 6. **Conclusion:** The product of the lengths of the segments (PA) and (PB) is equal to the product of the segments (PC) and (PD).

We start with the linear combinations given in the solution: [ 8(5a + 3b) - 3(13a + 8b) = a ] [ 5(13a + 8b) - 13(5a + 3b) = b ] 2. **Expanding and Simplifying**: First, let's expand and simplify the first linear combination: [ 8(5a + 3b) - 3(13a + 8b) = 8 cdot 5a + 8 cdot 3b - 3 cdot 13a - 3 cdot 8b ] [ = 40a + 24b - 39a - 24b ] [ = a ] Similarly, we expand and simplify the second linear combination: [ 5(13a + 8b) - 13(5a + 3b) = 5 cdot 13a + 5 cdot 8b - 13 cdot 5a - 13 cdot 3b ] [ = 65a + 40b - 65a - 39b ] [ = b ] 3. **Deduction**: From these simplified forms, we observe the following: - If a number d divides both 5a + 3b and 13a + 8b, it will also divide a and b as shown: [ d | (8(5a + 3b) - 3(13a + 8b)) implies d | a ] [ d | (5(13a + 8b) - 13(5a + 3b)) implies d | b ] Thus, any common divisor of 5a + 3b and 13a + 8b must also be a common divisor of a and b. Conversely, if a number d divides both a and b, it will certainly divide any linear combination of a and b, and hence 5a + 3b and 13a + 8b. 4. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the greatest common divisor of 5a + 3b and 13a + 8b is indeed the same as the greatest common divisor of a and b.

Also, determine when the perimeter is equal to twice the diagonal. 1. **Choosing Points on the Curve**: Consider a rectangle with vertices (A, B, C, D) in order, and let the closed curve intersect each side of the rectangle at least once. Choose one intersection point from each side of the rectangle. Label these points as follows: [ begin{aligned} &P in AB &Q in BC &R in CD &S in DA end{aligned} ] These points form a quadrilateral (PQRS). 2. **Constructing a Comparison Quadrilateral**: Any side of quadrilateral (PQRS) is less than or equal to the corresponding arc segment of the curve that lies between two consecutive points (P, Q, R, S). This implies that if we can prove the required property for the quadrilateral (PQRS), it will hold for the entire curve. 3. **Reflecting Points to Form a Rectangular Path**: To facilitate the proof, reflect the point (P) across the side (BC) to obtain a point (P_1). Reflect (P_1) again across the side (AD) to obtain a point (P_2). Next, reflect points (P_2) and (S) across the side (CD) to find points (P_3) and (S_3), respectively.

Thus, the desired result is shown: [ text{Perimeter of the curve} geq 2 times text{Diagonal of the rectangle} ] The perimeter equals twice the diagonal when the closed curve is a specific arrangement that forms straight-line segments coinciding with the path (P_1 Q R S_3 P_3). blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Jane's dad brought home 42 marble potatoes with different weights.

There are 5 family members in total (Jane's mom, dad, Jane, and her two siblings). The total weight of the potatoes is 13 kg, so we divide this by the number of family members to find the weight of each serving: 13 kg / 5 = 2.6 kg per serving Now, we need to figure out the possible weights of the 3 potatoes that make up each 2.6 kg serving. Since the potatoes have different weights, there are multiple combinations that could add up to 2.6 kg. Here are a few examples of combinations that could work: 1. A simple way to divide it would be to have each potato weigh approximately one-third of the serving weight. Since 2.6 kg is equal to 2600 grams, one-third would be approximately 867 grams. So, three potatoes could each weigh around 867 grams to make up a serving. However, since we're dealing with different weights, it's unlikely they'll be exactly the same. So, one combination could be: - Potato 1: 850 grams - Potato 2: 870 grams - Potato 3: 880 grams These three potatoes add up to 2600 grams or 2.6 kg. 2. Another combination could be with more variation in the weights: - Potato 1: 800 grams - Potato 2: 900 grams - Potato 3: 900 grams Again, these add up to 2600 grams or 2.6 kg. 3. Or a combination with one particularly heavy potato and two lighter ones: - Potato 1: 1000 grams (1 kg) - Potato 2: 800 grams - Potato 3: 800 grams This also adds up to 2600 grams or 2.6 kg.

We want to express ( n ) in the form suitable for finding the quotient and remainder when ( n ) is divided by ( d ). Rewrite ( n ) as follows: [ n = d cdot f - 1 = d (f - 1) + (d - 1) ] 4. Notice that the expression ( d (f - 1) + (d - 1) ) is in the form of ( q cdot d + r ), where ( q ) is the quotient and ( r ) is the remainder when ( n ) is divided by ( d ). Here, ( q = f - 1 ) and ( r = d - 1 ). 5. Therefore, when dividing ( n ) by ( d ), the quotient is ( f - 1 ) and the remainder is ( d - 1 ). 6. We now observe that for each divisor ( d ) of ( n + 1 ), this process should hold true. Specifically, the quotient ( f - 1 ) and the remainder ( d - 1 ) should be recorded. 7. Let's examine the process in reverse: Consider any divisor ( q + 1 ) of ( n + 1 ). Since ( d = q + 1 ) is a divisor of ( n + 1 ), we would have: [ n = d (f - 1) + (d - 1) ] 8. Hence, for each divisor ( d ) of ( n + 1 ), the quotient and remainder recorded, that is, ( f - 1 ) and ( d - 1 ), are precisely all the values the divisors of ( n + 1 ) (reduced by 1) take. 9. Since each ( d ) when iterated through all divisors of ( n + 1 ) generates corresponding values which exactly match each divisor of ( n + 1 ) reduced by 1, both sets — the set of quotients and the set of remainders — must consist of all the divisors of ( n + 1 ) each reduced by 1.

Since b and k overtake a at the same instant, they must have traveled the same distance as a has traveled by that time. Let t be the time it takes for b to catch up to a after b has started. In that time, b would have traveled: Distance_b = Speed_b * Time_b Distance_b = 40 km/hr * t Since b catches up to a, the distance traveled by b must be equal to the distance a has traveled plus the 150 km head start that a had: Distance_b = Distance_a + 150 km 40t = 30(t + 5) + 150 Now we solve for t: 40t = 30t + 150 + 150 40t = 30t + 300 40t - 30t = 300 10t = 300 t = 30 hours Now we know that b catches up to a after 30 hours.

Since similar triangles maintain the ratio of corresponding sides, we have: [ AE / AO = CF / CO implies AE cdot CF = AO^2 ] 6. **Lower Half Similarity**: On the lower half of the rhombus, similar reasoning provides: [ AO^2 = AH cdot CG ] Therefore, combining these proportions gives us: [ frac{AE}{AH} = frac{CG}{CF} ] 7. **Similar Triangles Imply Parallel Lines**: Triangles ( AEH ) and ( CGF ) are similar, leading to the conclusion: [ angle AEH = angle CGF ] As ( AB parallel CD ), and the corresponding angles ( angle AEH ) and ( angle CGF ) imply that the lines ( EH ) and ( FG ) must also be parallel. # Conclusion: [ boxed{EH parallel FG} ]"},{"prompt":"What is the smallest fourdigit positive integer that is divisible by 53?","completion":"1.

Thus, the inequality representing the condition for no losses is: [25x geq 3000 + 20x - 0.1x^2] 3. **Rearrange the inequality**: To solve for x, we rearrange the inequality: [0 geq 3000 + 20x - 0.1x^2 - 25x] Simplifying this gives us: [0 geq -0.1x^2 - 5x + 3000] 4. **Further simplification**: To make the inequality easier to handle, we can multiply everything by -10 (remember that doing this reverses the inequality sign) to get: [0 leq x^2 + 50x - 30000] 5. **Solve the quadratic equation**: To find the critical points where the total revenue equals total cost, we solve: [x^2 + 50x - 30000 = 0] Using the quadratic formula x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}, where a = 1, b = 50, and c = -30000, we get: [x = frac{-50 pm sqrt{50^2 - 4(1)(-30000)}}{2(1)}] [x = frac{-50 pm sqrt{2500 + 120000}}{2}] [x = frac{-50 pm sqrt{122500}}{2}] [x = frac{-50 pm 350}{2}] 6. **Find the values of x**: Calculating the two possible values of x: - For the positive solution: x = frac{-50 + 350}{2} = frac{300}{2} = 150 - For the negative solution (which we will discard based on the context of the problem): x = frac{-50 - 350}{2} 7. **Consider the domain of x**: Given the domain 0 < x < 240, and the fact that x must be a positive integer, we disregard the negative solution and focus on the positive one. 8. **Conclusion**: The minimum output at which the producer does not incur losses is at x = 150 units, considering that x geq 150 is the valid solution within the given domain for x.

The double angle formula for cosine is cos 2alpha = cos^2 alpha - sin^2 alpha, and we can incorporate it into our equation: 2(cos^2 alpha - sin^2 alpha) = dfrac { sqrt {2}}{2} cos alpha - dfrac { sqrt {2}}{2} sin alpha. We simplify the left side by applying the Pythagorean identity sin^2 alpha + cos^2 alpha = 1, which allows us to substitute 1 - sin^2 alpha for cos^2 alpha, yielding: 2(1 - 2sin^2 alpha) = dfrac { sqrt {2}}{2} cos alpha - dfrac { sqrt {2}}{2} sin alpha. Now, we want to express cos alpha in terms of sin alpha. By using the identity cos alpha = sqrt{1 - sin^2 alpha} and substituting it into the equation: 2(1 - 2sin^2 alpha) = dfrac { sqrt {2}}{2} sqrt{1 - sin^2 alpha} - dfrac { sqrt {2}}{2} sin alpha. Solving for sin alpha, we get: sin alpha = -dfrac {sqrt{2}}{4} quad text{or} quad sin alpha = dfrac {sqrt{2}}{4}. However, considering the initial condition involves a positive sine value on the right, sin alpha is more likely to be positive. Thus, we choose sin alpha = dfrac {sqrt{2}}{4}.

Using the double angle formula for sine, sin 2alpha = 2sin alpha cos alpha, we find: sin 2alpha = 2left(dfrac {sqrt {2}}{4}right)left(dfrac {sqrt {2}}{2}right) = dfrac {1}{2}. However, since we are given cos 2alpha and cos^2 alpha + sin^2 alpha = 1, we can write: 1 = cos^2 alpha + sin^2 alpha = left( dfrac {sqrt {2}}{2} right)^2 + left( dfrac {sqrt {2}}{4} right)^2 = dfrac {1}{2} + dfrac {1}{8} = dfrac {5}{8}. This equation has a contradiction. Hence, we made an error in our assumptions. Since sin alpha cannot be positive, it must be negative sin alpha = -dfrac {sqrt{2}}{4}. Re-calculating, we have: sin alpha + cos alpha = -dfrac {sqrt {2}}{4} + dfrac {sqrt {2}}{2} = dfrac {sqrt {2}}{4}. Substituting back into the double angle formula for sine: sin 2alpha = 2sin alpha cos alpha = 2left(-dfrac {sqrt {2}}{4}right)left(dfrac {sqrt {2}}{2}right) = -dfrac {7}{8}.

What question should you ask the wizard so that, regardless of whether bal means no or yes, the wizard answers bal?","completion":"Below is the detailed step-by-step solution for the given problem: # Problem: You are on an island and want to marry the daughter of the local tribe's chief. The chief will only give his daughter in marriage to someone who is marked by wisdom, which means you must pass a test. You must ask a question to the wizard. If the wizard answers \\"bal,\\" you will marry the daughter. If the wizard answers \\"yes,\\" you will need to find another bride elsewhere. It is unknown whether the wizard is a human or a zombie. What question should you ask the wizard so that, regardless of whether \\"bal\\" means \\"no\\" or \\"yes,\\" the wizard will answer \\"bal\\"? 1. **Define the Question H**: To simplify the reasoning, let's denote the question \\"Are you a human?\\" by H. Our task is not to directly ask whether H is true or false. Instead, we need to determine if \\"bal\\" is the correct answer to H regardless of whether \\"bal\\" means \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\". 2. **Case 1: The wizard is human**: - If \\"bal\\" means \\"yes\\": - H is \\"Are you a human?\\". - \\"bal\\" (meaning \\"yes\\") is the correct answer to H. - Since the wizard (human) should provide a truthful answer, the wizard will reply with \\"bal\\". - If \\"bal\\" means \\"no\\": - H is \\"Are you a human?\\". - \\"bal\\" (meaning \\"no\\") is not the correct answer to H. - Since the wizard (human) should provide a truthful answer, and \\"yes\\" would be the correct answer, the wizard will knowingly provide \\"bal\\" as the truthful \\"incorrect response\\", which does not change our tailored question. Thus, in both situations, the wizard being human will answer \\"bal\\" to our question because \\"bal\\" as \\"yes\\" or \\"no\\" does not misalign. 3. **Case 2: The wizard is a zombie**: - If \\"bal\\" means \\"yes\\": - H is \\"Are you a human?\\". - \\"bal\\" (meaning \\"yes\\") is the incorrect response to H because the wizard is not human. - Since zombies always lie, the zombie should give a false answer. Instead of giving a correct false, the zombie results in \\"bal\\". - If \\"bal\\" means \\"no\\": - H is \\"Are you a human?\\". - \\"bal\\" (meaning \\"no\\") is the accurate answer as the wizard is a zombie. - Since zombies always lie, they will lie about the correctness and answer \\"bal\\", which upends our tailored question. Thus, irrespective of possibilities, the wizard being a zombie will always reply with \\"bal\\" owing to the tailored question's built-in alignment logic to counteract the untruthfulness in this problematic scenario. **Conclusion**: Following this constructed approach to encompass all contingencies– we determine that the question: text{\\"Is 'bal' the correct answer to the question - 'Are you a human?'} \\" as tailored, ensures \\"bal\\" as the response.

[ a = a^2, b = -(4a - 1), c = 3 ] So: [ z = frac{(4a - 1) pm sqrt{(4a - 1)^2 - 4 cdot a^2 cdot 3}}{2a^2} ] [ z = frac{(4a - 1) pm sqrt{(16a^2 - 8a + 1) - 12a^2}}{2a^2} ] [ z = frac{(4a - 1) pm sqrt{4a^2 - 8a + 1}}{2a^2} ] [ z = frac{(4a - 1) pm sqrt{(2a - 1)^2}}{2a^2} ] 5. **Step 5:** Since (sqrt{(2a - 1)^2} = |2a - 1|), we get two solutions for ( z ): [ z = frac{(4a - 1) pm |2a - 1|}{2a^2} ] 6. **Step 6:** Evaluate the different cases for ( 2a - 1 ). - **Case 1: ( 2a - 1 ge 0 Rightarrow a ge frac{1}{2} ):** [ z_1 = frac{(4a - 1) + (2a - 1)}{2a^2} = frac{6a - 2}{2a^2} = frac{3a - 1}{a^2} ] [ z_2 = frac{(4a - 1) - (2a - 1)}{2a^2} = frac{2a}{2a^2} = frac{1}{a} ] - **Case 2: ( 2a - 1 < 0 Rightarrow a < frac{1}{2} ):** [ z_1 = frac{(4a - 1) - (2a - 1)}{2a^2} = frac{2a}{2a^2} = frac{1}{a} ] [ z_2 = frac{(4a - 1) + (2a - 1)}{2a^2} = frac{6a - 2}{2a^2} = frac{3a - 1}{a^2} ] Thus, the result from both cases is the same and does not change the number of solutions: 7. **Step 7:** Check the number of solutions in the context of the original equation ( y = ax^2 ). - For ( z = frac{3a - 1}{a^2} ): [ x^2 = frac{3a - 1}{a^2} ] [ y = a x^2 = a cdot frac{3a - 1}{a^2} = frac{3a - 1}{a} ] - For ( z = frac{1}{a} ): [ x^2 = frac{1}{a} ] [ y = a x^2 = a cdot frac{1}{a} = 1 ] Since both these quadratics lead to two distinct values for ( x ), each case can result in two points for each ( z ). Hence, we verify there are at most four intersection points. **Conclusion:** The number of different real solutions of this system is exactly four.

Since (K) and (M) are midpoints, (IK) and (IM) are the distances from (I) to the midpoints of (AB) and (CD) respectively. 3. Recall that in a circumscribed quadrilateral, the sum of the lengths of opposite sides is equal. Therefore, (AB + CD = AD + BC). 4. We are given that (frac{2IK}{AB} cdot frac{2IM}{CD} = 1). This implies that: [ frac{IK}{AB/2} cdot frac{IM}{CD/2} = 1 ] Simplifying, we get: [ frac{IK}{K} cdot frac{IM}{M} = 1 ] where (K = AB/2) and (M = CD/2). 5. Next, we use the fact that (angle AIB + angle CID = 180^circ). If (angle AIB = angle CID = 90^circ), then (overline{AD} parallel overline{BC}), which contradicts the given condition that no two sides of (ABCD) are parallel. 6. Let (I_1) be the inverse of (I) in ((CD)). Then (frac{2IK}{AB} = frac{2I_1M}{CD}) and (angle AIB = angle CI_1D). Since (angle AIB) and (angle CI_1D) are not (90^circ), this establishes (triangle AIB sim triangle CI_1D) or (triangle AIB sim triangle DI_1C). 7. This similarity implies that: [ frac{IC}{ID} = frac{I_1C}{I_1D} in left{frac{IA}{IB}, frac{IB}{IA}right} ] Thus, we have either (IA cdot IC = IB cdot ID) or (IA cdot ID = IB cdot IC). 8. However, the latter implies (AD = BC), which is not allowed. To see this, let (r) denote the inradius of (ABCD); then we have: [ frac{IA cdot IB}{AB} = frac{2[IAB]}{AB sin angle AIB} = frac{2r}{sin angle AIB} = frac{2r}{sin angle CID} = frac{2[ICD]}{CD sin angle CID} = frac{IC cdot ID}{CD} ] 9.

Letting (I_2) be the inverse of (I) in ((BC)), we have (triangle AID sim triangle BI_2C).

When both cars had traveled the same distance, both cars stopped. How many miles did Car X travel from the time Car Y began traveling until both cars stopped?","completion":"First, let's convert the 72 minutes into hours because the speed is given in miles per hour. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 72 minutes is 72/60 hours. 72 minutes = 72/60 hours = 1.2 hours Car X has a head start of 35 miles/hour * 1.2 hours = 42 miles before Car Y starts. Now, let's set up an equation to find out how long it takes for Car Y to catch up to Car X. Let's call the time it takes for Car Y to catch up to Car X \\"t\\" hours. In that time, Car X will have traveled an additional 35 miles/hour * t hours. Car Y will have traveled 40 miles/hour * t hours. Since Car Y is trying to cover the head start distance plus the same distance as Car X travels in time t, we can set up the following equation: Distance traveled by Car Y = Distance traveled by Car X + Head start distance 40t = 35t + 42 Now, we solve for t: 40t - 35t = 42 5t = 42 t = 42 / 5 t = 8.4 hours So, Car Y catches up to Car X after 8.4 hours. Now, we need to find out how far Car X traveled from the time Car Y began traveling until both cars stopped. We already know Car X travels at 35 miles/hour, so: Distance traveled by Car X in 8.4 hours = 35 miles/hour * 8.4 hours = 294 miles Therefore, Car X traveled boxed{294} miles from the time Car Y began traveling until both cars stopped."},{"prompt":"Find the matrix (mathbf{N}) that swaps the rows of a matrix.

Solution 1: Inductive Approach 1. **Base Case (n = 0):** - When n = 0, the set S is empty. There is only one subset of S, which is the empty set itself. We can color it either blue or red. If N = 0, we color it blue; if N = 1, we color it red. Both conditions (a) and (b) are trivially satisfied as there are no two distinct subsets to consider. 2. **Inductive Step:** - Assume that for a set S' with k elements, we can properly color its subsets such that conditions (a), (b), and (c) are satisfied for any 0 leq N leq 2^k. - Consider a set S with k+1 elements. Let s be an element of S, and let S' = S setminus {s}. - If N leq 2^k, color all subsets of S containing s blue, and color the subsets of S' according to the inductive hypothesis to have exactly N red subsets. The union of any two red subsets is red as they are subsets of S', and the union of any two blue subsets is blue as they either contain s or are subsets of S'. - If N > 2^k, color all subsets of S containing s red, and color N - 2^k subsets of S' red according to the inductive hypothesis. The union of any two red subsets is red, and the union of any two blue subsets is blue by similar reasoning as above. - This completes the inductive step. By induction, we have shown that it is possible to color the subsets of any set with n elements to satisfy conditions (a), (b), and (c) for any 0 leq N leq 2^n. Thus, the statement holds for n = 2002. Solution 2: Binary Representation Approach 1. **Special Cases:** - If N = 0, color every subset blue. - If N = 2^{2002}, color every subset red. 2. **General Case:** - Write N in binary as N = sum_{i=1}^{k} 2^{a_i}, where each a_i is distinct. - Color each subset of S the color of its largest element. Define the color of each element i in S as red if i = a_j for some j, and blue otherwise. - The empty set is colored blue. - This coloring satisfies conditions (a) and (b) because the largest element in the union of any two subsets determines the color, and the union of subsets with the same largest element will have subsets of the same color. - The number of subsets colored red is exactly sum_{i=1}^{k} 2^{a_i} = N, satisfying condition (c). Both solutions demonstrate that it is possible to color the subsets of S to satisfy the given conditions.

According to the problem's condition, the three-digit number is five times the product of its digits. Therefore, we can write: [ 100a + 10b + c = 5abc ] 2. **Simplification Using Divisibility**: We need to express c in terms of a, b, and c. We know that the number must be five times the product of its digits. Rearranging the equation, we get: [ 100a + 10b + c = 5abc implies c = 5abc - 100a - 10b ] Hence, it is clear that c has to be a factor of 5 because it is alone on one side of the equation. Furthermore, c cannot be zero because the product of the digits would also be zero, violating the condition. Therefore: [ c = 5 ] 3. **Plugging c=5 into the Equation**: Substituting c = 5 back into the original equation, we obtain: [ 100a + 10b + 5 = 5ab cdot 5 = 25ab ] Simplifying further: [ 100a + 10b + 5 = 25ab implies 20a + 2b + 1 = 5ab ] We further simplify to: [ 2(10a + b) = 5ab - 1 ] 4. **Analyzing the Divisibility and Modular Arithmetic**: To satisfy the above equation, 10a + b must leave a remainder of 2 when divided by 5. This is because: [ 5ab - 1 equiv 4 pmod{5} quad text{and} quad 2(10a + b) = 5ab - 1 ] Therefore, 10a + b equiv 2 pmod{5}. 5. **Possible Values for b**: We now consider possible b values.

This means the distance between each buoy and the next is the same. Given that reaching the third buoy means the swimmer has swum out 72 meters, we can calculate the distance between the beach and each buoy by dividing this distance by the number of intervals up to the third buoy. Since there are two intervals between the first and third buoys, we calculate the distance of each interval as follows: - Distance per interval = Total distance to the third buoy / Number of buoys up to the third buoy - Distance per interval = 72 meters / 3 - Distance per interval = 24 meters This calculation tells us that each buoy is 24 meters away from the preceding one (or from the beach for the first buoy). To find out how far the fourth buoy is from the beach, we multiply the distance per interval by the number of intervals up to the fourth buoy: - Distance to the fourth buoy = Distance per interval * Number of buoys up to the fourth buoy - Distance to the fourth buoy = 24 meters * 4 - Distance to the fourth buoy = 96 meters Therefore, the fourth buoy is 96 meters away from the beach. boxed{96}"},{"prompt":"A large rectangular region is tiled with congruent squares and congruent hexagons.

Then, ( 2 leq x_i leq 5 ) for all ( i ). 2. **Proof of Claim:** Assume without loss of generality that ( x_1 ) has the largest value among these numbers. Clearly, ( x_i geq 2 ) by definition, so it suffices to prove that ( x_1 leq 5 ). 3. Since ( x_1 = gcd(x_{n-1}, x_n) + gcd(x_2, x_3) ), one of the terms must be ( geq x_1/2 ). Assume ( gcd(x_2, x_3) geq x_1/2 ). 4. Notice that if ( d mid x_i, x_{i+1}, x_{i+2} ), then ( d mid x_{i+2} - gcd(x_i, x_{i+1}) = gcd(x_{i+3}, x_{i+4}) implies d mid x_{i+4}, x_{i+5} ) (here the indices are taken modulo ( n )). Thus, by a simple induction, ( gcd(x_1, x_2, x_3) ) divides all the numbers on the circle. This implies ( gcd(x_1, x_2, x_3) = 1 ). 5. If ( gcd(x_2, x_3) = x_1/2 ), then ( gcd(x_1, x_1/2) = 1 implies x_1 = 2 ), done. If not, then ( gcd(x_2, x_3) > x_1/2 ), which implies ( x_2 = x_3 ) (otherwise one of them is ( geq 2gcd(x_2, x_3) > x_1 )). 6. Now, ( gcd(x_4, x_5) = x_3 - gcd(x_1, x_2) = x_3 - 1 ), and similarly ( x_4 = x_5 = x_3 - 1 ) if ( x_3 > x_1/2 + 1 ). However, if ( x_4 = x_3 - 1 ), then ( x_3 = gcd(x_2, x_3) < gcd(x_2, x_3) + gcd(x_5, x_6) = x_4 ), contradiction, so ( x_1/2 < x_3 leq x_1/2 + 1 ). 7. If ( x_1 = 2k ) for some ( k in mathbb{Z^+} ), then ( x_2 = x_3 = k+1 ) and ( gcd(x_4, x_5) = k ), so ( x_4 = 2k ) (since ( x_4 leq x_1 ) and ( x_4 neq x_3 - 1 )) and ( x_5 = k ). Then, notice that ( gcd(x_5, x_6) = x_4 - gcd(x_2, x_3) = k-1 ), so ( k - 1 mid k implies k = 2 implies x_1 = 4 ), done. 8. Similarly, if ( x_1 = 2k + 1 ), then ( x_2 = x_3 = k+1 ) and ( x_4 = 2k ) or ( 3k ). If ( x_4 = 3k ), then ( 3k leq 2k + 1 implies k = 1 implies x_1 = 3 ), while if ( x_4 = 2k ), then proceed as before and we get ( x_1 = 5 ). 9. Thus, the claim is proven. ( blacksquare ) 10.

Let ( r ) be the remainder of the digit sum (common to all ( a_i )), and ( s ) be the corresponding remainder for ( b_i ) (both between 0 and 8 inclusive). 3.

For the roots to be real, the discriminant of the equation must be non-negative, which gives b^2 - 4ac geq 0 Rightarrow (6k)^2 - 4 cdot 8 cdot (2k + 1) geq 0 Rightarrow 36k^2 - 64k - 32 geq 0. Solving this inequality does not guarantee that both roots are positive and their sum is less than or equal to 1. Furthermore, for the sum of the roots to be positive and less than or equal to 1, k must be negative, which contradicts the condition derived from the discriminant that would require k to satisfy certain positive values to ensure real roots. Therefore, it is impossible for the two roots to be the sine values of the two acute angles of a right-angled triangle. Thus, the conclusion is boxed{text{The two roots cannot be the sine values of the two acute angles of a right-angled triangle.}}"},{"prompt":"A large cube with an edge length of ( n ) is constructed from ( n^3 ) unit cubes.

To prove this by contradiction, let us assume the opposite: that it is impossible to construct the right-angle triangle with its vertices centered at the marked unit cubes. 1. Consider a marked unit cube: Each unit cube in the cube of side n is at the center of the intersections of three sets of 1 times 1 times n cuboids. 2. Each cuboid spans n units in one direction (say x, y, or z) and is 1 times 1 in the orthogonal directions. 3. Since we select more than frac{3}{2} n^2 unit cubes, each unit cube (at position (x, y, z)) is at the intersection of: - one cuboid running along x-axis - one cuboid running along y-axis - one cuboid running along z-axis. 4. We calculate the number of such cuboids which at most contain one marked unit cube: - There are three orientations for these orthogonal cuboids, and each can have positions in the grid from 0 to n-1 for a given plane choice. Hence, there are 3n^2 such cuboids in total (since for each of the 3 dimensions there are n^2 positions). 5. Given that any marked unit cube in the large cube is at the intersection of three such cuboids: - If it is assumed that it is impossible to form a right-angle triangle from the centers of marked unit cubes, then in each cuboid, at least two wholly different, second cuboid would be without a marked unit cube. 6. Given each marked cube is in at least two of the orthogonal cuboids, due to the pigeonhole principle: - The total number of ways to distribute these marked cubes such that no two overlap in conditions, we calculate that each marked unit sits within each cuboid configuration exceeding 3 n^2. This means that marking of more than frac{3}{2} n^2 would contradict the arrangement of marked configurations over distinct cuboids. Thus, leading to contradiction: More than frac{3}{2} n^2 such marked places guarantees at least two overlapping cuboid coordinates, ensuring overlaps in mathbf{n}. Thus constructing the right triangle configuration is always feasible.

For the lake races, the current speed of 0.5 mph will either add to or subtract from Tyson's swimming speed of 3 mph, depending on whether he is swimming with or against the current. Since we don't have information on the direction of the swim relative to the current, we'll assume the current's effect is neutral on average. Therefore, we'll use Tyson's swimming speed without adjusting for the current. For the ocean races, the same logic applies with a current speed of 0.7 mph and Tyson's swimming speed of 2.5 mph. Let's calculate the time for each race: Lake races: 1. 2 miles at 3 mph: 2 / 3 = 0.6667 hours 2. 3.2 miles at 3 mph: 3.2 / 3 = 1.0667 hours 3. 3.5 miles at 3 mph: 3.5 / 3 = 1.1667 hours 4. 1.8 miles at 3 mph: 1.8 / 3 = 0.6 hours 5. 4 miles at 3 mph: 4 / 3 = 1.3333 hours Ocean races: 1. 2.5 miles at 2.5 mph: 2.5 / 2.5 = 1 hour 2. 3.5 miles at 2.5 mph: 3.5 / 2.5 = 1.4 hours 3. 2 miles at 2.5 mph: 2 / 2.5 = 0.8 hours 4. 3.7 miles at 2.5 mph: 3.7 / 2.5 = 1.48 hours 5. 4.2 miles at 2.5 mph: 4.2 / 2.5 = 1.68 hours Now, let's add up the time for all races: Lake races total time: 0.6667 + 1.0667 + 1.1667 + 0.6 + 1.3333 = 4.8334 hours Ocean races total time: 1 + 1.4 + 0.8 + 1.48 + 1.68 = 6.36 hours Total time for all races: 4.8334 + 6.36 = 11.1934 hours Tyson spent approximately boxed{11.1934} hours in his races."},{"prompt":"S=sin{64x}+sin{65x} and C=cos{64x}+cos{65x} are both rational for some x .

We need to prove that for one of these sums, both summands are rational too. 2. Consider the expression ( S^2 + C^2 ): [ S^2 + C^2 = (sin{64x} + sin{65x})^2 + (cos{64x} + cos{65x})^2 ] Expanding both squares, we get: [ S^2 + C^2 = sin^2{64x} + 2sin{64x}sin{65x} + sin^2{65x} + cos^2{64x} + 2cos{64x}cos{65x} + cos^2{65x} ] 3. Using the Pythagorean identity ( sin^2{theta} + cos^2{theta} = 1 ), we can simplify: [ S^2 + C^2 = (sin^2{64x} + cos^2{64x}) + (sin^2{65x} + cos^2{65x}) + 2(sin{64x}sin{65x} + cos{64x}cos{65x}) ] [ S^2 + C^2 = 1 + 1 + 2(sin{64x}sin{65x} + cos{64x}cos{65x}) ] [ S^2 + C^2 = 2 + 2(sin{64x}sin{65x} + cos{64x}cos{65x}) ] 4. Using the product-to-sum identities, we know: [ sin{64x}sin{65x} + cos{64x}cos{65x} = cos{(64x - 65x)} = cos{(-x)} = cos{x} ] Therefore: [ S^2 + C^2 = 2 + 2cos{x} ] 5. Since ( S ) and ( C ) are rational, ( S^2 + C^2 ) is also rational. Thus, ( 2 + 2cos{x} ) is rational, implying ( cos{x} ) is rational. 6. Now, we use the double-angle formula repeatedly to express ( cos{64x} ) in terms of ( cos{x} ): [ cos{2y} = 2cos^2{y} - 1 ] Applying this formula iteratively, we can express ( cos{64x} ) as a rational function of ( cos{x} ). Since ( cos{x} ) is rational, ( cos{64x} ) is also rational. 7. Given that ( C = cos{64x} + cos{65x} ) is rational and ( cos{64x} ) is rational, it follows that ( cos{65x} ) must also be rational (since the sum of two rational numbers is rational). 8.

This is a highly simplified guide to get you started on a complex project. Depending on your requirements and expertise, you might need to delve deeper into specific Max/MSP objects and digital signal processing (DSP) techniques. Engaging with the Max for Live community through forums and tutorials can provide valuable insights and assistance as you develop your vocal dub aligner."},{"prompt":"how do i do it","completion":"Creating a vocal dub aligner in Max for Live (M4L) from scratch is an advanced project, involving knowledge in both digital signal processing (DSP) and programming within the Max/MSP environment. Below is a more detailed approach to getting started, focusing on breaking down the task into manageable parts. This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of Max for Live. # 1. Familiarize with Max/MSP First, ensure you have a solid grasp of the Max environment. There are several tutorials on the Cycling '74 website and YouTube to help you get started if you're not already familiar. # 2. Analyzing the Audio You'll need to analyze both the original track and the vocals you want to align. Focus on two main aspects: tempo and pitch. - **Tempo Analysis**: Use objects like \`beat~\` (if available) or build a beat detection algorithm using \`zerox~\` (zero-crossings), \`bonk~\`, or other FFT (Fast Fourier Transform) objects to estimate the tempo. - **Pitch Analysis**: For pitch, \`fiddle~\`, \`sigmund~\`, or \`pitch~\` can be excellent choices. These objects can give you real-time pitch tracking information. # 3. Audio Alignment Assuming you now have data on the tempo and pitch of both tracks: - **Time-stretching**: You'll align the tempo first. The \`groove~\` object can time-stretch samples. However, implementing granular synthesis or similar techniques might be necessary for a more advanced-aligner. - **Pitch Correction**: Once the tempos are aligned, you'll move on to pitch. For pitch shifting, you might consider \`gizmo~\`. Your approach here will depend on how you analyzed the pitch; ensure you're shifting in a musically relevant manner (e.g., matching scales or tuning). # 4. Manual Controls You will invariably need manual override controls for users to fine-tune the alignment. Use UI objects like \`live.dial\` and \`live.slider\` for user input. You might want to provide controls for: - Adjustment of pitch shift amount. - Control over time-stretch parameters. - Wet/Dry mix for blending the aligned vocal track with the original. # 5. Implementation Steps in Max Now, let's outline how you might start patching this together in Max: - **Audio Input**: Use \`adc~\` or \`live.audio~\` objects to get audio inputs. - **Split Channels**: Considering one channel for original track analysis and another for the dub. - **Analysis**: Implement pitch and tempo analysis on both channels. - **Processing**: Based on analysis, apply pitch correction and time-stretching. - **Output**: Mix the processed audio according to user control and output. # 6. Testing and Debugging Work in iterations. Start by testing pitch detection and correction on a simple wave file. Then move on to more complex audio. Always compare the aligned audio to the original for synchronization. # 7. Optimizing and Finalizing Ensure your device is CPU-efficient. Use \`poly~\` for voice management if necessary. Also, provide a comprehensive guide or tooltips for users to understand how to use your device effectively. # Learning and Resources This project requires a deep dive into both DSP theory and practical Max/MSP programming. Utilize the following: - **Cycling '74 Documentation and Tutorials**: A vital resource for understanding Max/MSP objects and how to use them. - **DSP Theory Books and Online Resources**: To get a deeper understanding of how pitch correction and time-stretching work. - **Max/MSP Forums and Communities**: For specific questions, feedback, or seeing how others approached similar problems. Remember, a project like this is complex and might take substantial time and effort to realize, especially to make it work smoothly in a live performance setting. Patience and persistence are key. Good luck!"},{"prompt":"code a vocal dub alinger in python","completion":"Creating a vocal dub aligner in Python is a complex task, but it's entirely achievable with the right libraries and understanding. The essential idea behind a vocal dub aligner is to adjust the timing and pitch of one vocal track (the dub) to match another (the original), which involves signal processing techniques like time stretching and pitch shifting. For this outline, we'll leverage a few powerful Python libraries: 1. **LibROSA**: for audio analysis, pitch detection, and time stretching. 2. **NumPy**: for handling numerical operations. 3. **SciPy**: for more scientific computations that may be required. This high-level guide will set you on a path to creating a basic vocal dub aligner. Keep in mind, the real work involves refining algorithms to get good sound quality and alignment. # Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment Ensure Python is installed on your system and install the necessary libraries. You can do this via pip in your command line or terminal: \`\`\`bash pip install librosa numpy scipy \`\`\` # Step 2: Loading Audio and Preparing First, load both the original and the dub audio files. We'll use LibROSA as it provides an easy-to-use interface for loading and manipulating audio files. \`\`\`python import librosa # Load the original and the dub tracks original_track, sr_orig = librosa.load('path_to_original.wav', sr=None) dub_track, sr_dub = librosa.load('path_to_dub.wav', sr=None) assert sr_orig == sr_dub, \\"Sample rates do not match!\\" \`\`\` # Step 3: Pitch Correction You want to match the pitch of the dub track to the original. Pitch shifting is complex and may require detecting pitch, which is outside the direct scope of this simple guide. However, to change pitch, you can use \`librosa.effects.pitch_shift\`. Note: Real applications would first analyze pitch over time and decide how much and when to shift. \`\`\`python import numpy as np # Example: Shift dub track pitch by one semitone dub_shifted = librosa.effects.pitch_shift(dub_track, sr_orig, n_steps=1) \`\`\` # Step 4: Time Stretching Time stretching will help align the durations or specific sections. Again, real applications require analysis to decide where and how much to stretch. \`\`\`python # Calculate stretch factor; This is a simplistic approach stretch_factor = len(original_track) / len(dub_shifted) dub_stretched = librosa.effects.time_stretch(dub_shifted, rate=stretch_factor) \`\`\` # Step 5: Simple Alignment (Cross-Correlation) For alignment, you can use cross-correlation to find where the tracks most closely align. This is a basic form of synchronization. \`\`\`python from scipy.signal import correlate import numpy as np # Ensure the tracks are the same length for this operation if len(dub_stretched) > len(original_track): dub_stretched = dub_stretched[:len(original_track)] else: original_track = original_track[:len(dub_stretched)] # Cross-Correlation corr = correlate(original_track, dub_stretched, mode='same') # Find the alignment point shift = len(corr) // 2 - np.argmax(np.abs(corr)) # Example of a very basic method to align using numpy roll dub_aligned = np.roll(dub_stretched, shift) \`\`\` # Important Considerations - **Analysis and Correction Precision**: In practice, pitch correction and synchronization are much more complex. They usually involve detailed analysis and selective processing of different audio sections. - **Pitch Detection**: LibROSA offers pitch detection functions that are essential for fine-tuning pitch correction. - **Quality Loss**: Time stretching and pitch shifting can introduce artifacts or quality loss. Sophisticated algorithms aim to minimize these but they require a deeper dive into DSP. - **Sample Rate Assumptions**: The simple code assumes both tracks have the same sample rate for simplicity. Real scenarios might require resampling. # Conclusion This guide provides a foundational approach to aligning vocal dubs in Python but lacks the finesse and detail of professional tools. Developing a robust vocal dub aligner requires a deep dive into signal processing, thoughtful algorithm development, and extensive testing to handle the variety of real-world audio nuances. For deeper exploration, consider studying DSP theory, exploring more advanced aspects of LibROSA, and engaging with the audio signal processing community through forums and literature."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

初始化Spark会话 spark = SparkSession.builder .appName(\\"Pandas to Spark DF\\") .getOrCreate() \`\`\` 2. **使用Spark会话将Pandas DataFrame转换为Spark DataFrame**。 假设你已经有一个Pandas DataFrame命名为\`pandas_df\`，下面是将其转换为Spark DataFrame的示例代码： \`\`\`python # 导入必要的库 import pandas as pd from pyspark.sql import SparkSession # 创建一个Pandas DataFrame data = {'Name': ['Tom', 'Jerry', 'Mickey'], 'Age': [5, 6, 7]} pandas_df = pd.DataFrame(data) # 假设Spark会话已经通过变量spark初始化 # 将Pandas DataFrame转换为Spark DataFrame spark_df = spark.createDataFrame(pandas_df) # 查看Spark DataFrame spark_df.show() \`\`\` 转换完成后，你可以像处理任何其他Spark DataFrame那样处理\`spark_df\`，包括运行SQL查询、进行分布式计算等。 **注意事项：** - 转换Pandas DataFrame到Spark DataFrame时，PySpark会尝试推断数据的类型。在大多数情况下，这是没有问题的，但有时可能需要手动指定列的数据类型以确保准确性。 - PySpark和Spark环境占用大量内存和计算资源，因此确保你的机器或集群有足够资源处理数据。 - 如果你的数据集非常大，直接在Pandas中处理可能会受到单机内存的限制。在这种情况下，使用Spark可以有效分布计算和存储压力。 通过上述步骤，你可以轻松地在Pandas DataFrame和Spark DataFrame之间进行转换，充分利用Spark的分布式计算能力处理大数据集。"},{"prompt":"pandas object to datetime64[ns]","completion":"要将Pandas中的对象类型（通常是字符串）转换为\`datetime64[ns]\`类型，你可以使用Pandas的\`to_datetime()\`函数。这个函数非常灵活，能够解析多种格式的日期时间字符串，并将其转换为Pandas的\`Timestamp\`对象，即\`datetime64[ns]\`类型。 以下是一个简单的示例，展示如何进行转换： \`\`\`python import pandas as pd # 创建一个包含日期时间字符串的Pandas Series date_series = pd.Series(['2021-01-01', '2021-02-01', '2021-03-01']) # 转换为datetime64[ns]类型 datetime_series = pd.to_datetime(date_series) # 查看转换后的序列 print(datetime_series) \`\`\` 运行上述代码片段将输出类似于以下内容的结果，展示了转换后的日期时间： \`\`\` 0 2021-01-01 1 2021-02-01 2 2021-03-01 dtype: datetime64[ns] \`\`\` \`to_datetime()\`函数也有几个参数可以用来处理有问题的数据和自定义日期时间格式，例如： - \`errors\`参数：默认为\`'raise'\`，表示遇到无法解析的日期时间字符串时抛出异常；设为\`'coerce'\`时，无法解析的将被设置为NaT；设为\`'ignore'\`时，将不尝试转换无法解析的字符串，原样输出。 - \`format\`参数：你可以指定一个日期时间格式去解析字符串。例如，如果日期时间字符串是\\"年-日-月\\"的格式，你可以使用\`format='%Y-%d-%m'\`。 下面是一个使用\`format\`参数的例子： \`\`\`python date_series_custom_format = pd.Series(['2021-31-01', '2021-01-02', '2021-03-01']) datetime_series_custom_format = pd.to_datetime(date_series_custom_format, format='%Y-%d-%m') print(datetime_series_custom_format) \`\`\` 记住，使用自定义格式时，源数据必须严格遵循指定的格式，否则\`to_datetime()\`函数可能无法正确解析字符串。 通过使用\`pd.to_datetime()\`，你可以方便地将字符串或其他对象类型的数据转换为Pandas的\`datetime64[ns]\`类型，进而进行日期时间相关的操作和分析。"},{"prompt":"pandas object to float64","completion":"将Pandas对象（如字符串）转换为\`float64\`类型通常使用\`astype(float)\`或\`pd.to_numeric()\`方法。这种转换在数据清洗和准备阶段尤为重要，特别是当你从CSV文件或外部数据源导入数据时，因为这些数据可能会以字符串或对象类型被读入。 这里展示如何使用这些方法： # 使用\`astype(float)\`方法 如果你确定所有的对象都可以转换为浮点数，可以直接使用\`astype(float)\`来进行转换。 \`\`\`python import pandas as pd # 创建一个包含数字的字符串的Pandas Series series_obj = pd.Series(['1.0', '2.2', '3.3']) # 转换为float64类型 series_float = series_obj.astype(float) #

创建一个包含数字和非数字字符串的Pandas Series series_mixed = pd.Series(['1.0', 'not_a_number', '3.3']) # 使用pd.to_numeric()转换，设置errors='coerce'将无法转换的值设置为NaN series_float = pd.to_numeric(series_mixed, errors='coerce') # 输出结果及其数据类型 print(series_float) print(series_float.dtype) \`\`\` 在上面的例子中，\`errors='coerce'\`参数会把任何无法转换为数字的值变为\`NaN\`。这是一种很有用的技巧，因为它允许你继续处理数据而不会因为几个无效值而中断。值得注意的是，生成的\`NaN\`是浮点数特有的，这也意味着整个序列会被转换为浮点数。 \`pd.to_numeric()\`还有其他几个\`errors\`参数选项： - \`raise\`（默认）：如果存在无法转换为数字的值，则抛出异常。 - \`ignore\`：如果存在无法转换为数字的值，则返回原始输入数据。 根据不同的数据清洗需求和目的，适当选择方法和参数来完成对象到浮点数类型的转换。"},{"prompt":"生物科技医疗健康 中国股市的龙头股票有哪些 把主营业务 代码列出啦","completion":"截至我最后更新的时间（2023年4月），在中国股市（包括上海证券交易所和深圳证券交易所）中，生物科技和医疗健康领域的龙头公司包括各种制药、生物技术和医疗设备公司。请注意，股市时刻在变化，龙头公司的地位也可能发生变化。以下是一些中国生物科技和医疗健康领域值得关注的上市公司，以及他们的主营业务和股票代码： 1. **恒瑞医药（600276.SH）** - 主营业务：恒瑞医药是一家集药物研发、生产和销售为一体的大型制药企业，主要涉及抗肿瘤药物、外科用药等。 2. **药明康德（603259.SH）** - 主营业务：提供全方位的开放式创新平台，服务内容包括药物发现、开发、生产等环节。 3. **迈瑞医疗（300760.SZ）** - 主营业务：主要生产和销售医疗设备和仪器，包括临床检验设备、医疗影像设备等。 4. **复星医药（600196.SH）** - 主营业务：涵盖制药、医疗服务（包括医院等）和医疗诊断产品的多元化医药健康集团。 5. **泰格医药（300347.SZ）** - 主营业务：专注于医药临床研究服务(CRO)和临床试验委托服务。 6. **康泰生物（300601.SZ）** - 主营业务：主要从事人用疫苗的研发、生产和销售，其产品涵盖了多种预防疫苗。 7. **智飞生物（300122.SZ）** - 主营业务：专注于疫苗的研发、生产和销售，包括流感疫苗、百白破疫苗等。 8. **石药集团（1093.HK）** - 主营业务：一家综合性制药企业，业务包括原料药和制剂的研发、生产和销售。 请注意，投资股票涉及风险，投资前需要进行充分的研究和考虑。上述信息仅供参考，并不构成投资建议。此外，股市信息随时间快速变化，投资决策应基于最新数据和个人分析。"},{"prompt":"optimize sentence: Thank @Phang, Venus-LN for your help, I will proceed the analysis base on tomorrow’s report and share the finding once any finding was found.","completion":"Thank you @Phang and Venus-LN for your assistance.

In der Soziologie wurde dies als Heraufkunft einer »nivellierten Mittelstandgesellschaft« gedeutet. Die Ausdehnung industrieller Frauenlohnarbeit und die Kleinfamiliarisierung veränderten die Geschlechterverhältnisse. Eine entscheidende Grundlage des fordistischen Modells von Industrialisierung, Durchkapitalisierung, Wachstum und Massenkonsum war schließlich die Verfügung über ein scheinbar unbegrenztes Reservoir an natürlichen Ressourcen. Schrankenlose Naturausbeutung - beispielhaft der Zusammenhang von Automobilisierung, Ölverbrauch und Luftverschmutzung - war mit dem fordisti- schen Akkumulationsregime untrennbar verbunden. Dies alles bezeichnet jedoch nur bestimmte, den Fordismus allgemein charakterisierende Tendenzen. Auch wenn der Taylorismus ein zentrales, die Formen der Arbeitsorganisation, die Klassenverhältnisse und Lebensweisen prägendes Merkmal des fordistischen Akkumulationsregimes darstellt, so blieb seine Durchsetzung ungleichmäßig und unvollkommen. Nicht nur existierten erhebliche Unterschiede zwischen den verschiedenen Ländern, sondern wichtige Sektoren der gesellschaftlichen Produktion wie etwa der Maschinenbau oder große Teile des Dienstleistungssektors blieben, da auf der Basis der vorhandenen Technologien nicht tay-loristisch rationalisierbar, davon zunächst ausgenommen. Dies sollte sich mit der Zeit als wichtige Barriere des Produktivitätsfortschritts erweisen. Das fordistische Akkumulationsregime konnte sich nur deshalb erfolgreich durchsetzen, weil im Zuge der sozialen Auseinandersetzungen und angesichts der veränderten Kräfteverhältnisse unter den Bedingungen der Systemkonkurrenz die Regulationsweise grundlegend umgestaltet wurde. Das Verschwinden traditioneller Produktions- und Lebensweisen, die Verallgemeinerung des Lohnverhältnisses und die Veränderung der Fa-milienformen brachte massenhafte soziale Risiken - etwa bei Krankheit, Arbeitslosigkeit und Alter - mit sich, die kollektive soziale Schutzmaßnahmen notwendiger machten. Zumindest in den kapitalistischen Metropolen und da auch in sehr unterschiedlichem Ausmaß gelang es den Organisationen der Arbeiterbewegung, den Ausbau des Sozialstaats voranzutreiben. Der Erfolg dieser Kämpfe erwies sich zunächst einmal als wichtiger Stabilitätsfaktor des fordistischen Akkumulationsregimes. Die Einführung sozialstaatlicher Sicherungen diente nicht nur dazu, die Arbeitskräfte physisch zu erhalten und die Klassenauseinandersetzungen still zu stellen, sondern bildete auch ein wichtiges Mittel zur Stabilisierung des Massenkonsums. Auf der Basis verallgemeinerter und standardisierter Lohnarbeitsverhältnisse konnten sich starke und übergreifende Gewerkschaften bilden, denen unter den Bedingungen einer wachsenden Wirtschaft gewisse Spielräume zur Verbesserung der Einkommens- und Arbeitsbedingungen zur Verfügung standen. »Sozialpartnerschaftliche« und »korporative«, d.h. Gewerkschaften, Unternehmerverbände und den Staat umfassende kollektive Verhandlungssysteme setzten sich - ebenfalls wieder in unterschiedlicher Stärke - durch und wurden zu einer wichtigen Grundlage für die Steuerung der Wirtschaft. Die fordistische Regulationsweise beinhaltete damit eine zentralisierte und staatlich vermittelte Institutionalisierung des kapitalistischen Klassengegensatzes. Während sozialpartnerschaftliche Aushandlungsprozesse zu einem wichtigen Bestandteil der Regulation wurden, dehnte sich zugleich die soziale und ökonomische Interventionstätigkeit des Staates aus. Sozial-, Wachstums-, Forschungs-, Industrie- und Konjunkturpolitik, Unterstützungszahlungen und Subventionen sowie die Anwendung eines immer weiter ausgebauten gesamtwirtschaftlichen Steuerungsinstrumentariums - vor allem im Bereich der Geld- und Fiskalpolitik - wurden zum Merkmal des »key- nesianischen« Staates. Die makroökonomische Theorie von John M. Keynes, die die Notwendigkeit eines staatsadministrativen Instrumentariums zur Verstetigung des Wachstumsprozesses und zur Vermeidung konjunktureller Krisen begründet, begann ihren Siegeszug. Diese Entwicklung wurde durch die »Massen«- oder »Volksparteien« gestützt, d.h. von ideologisch eher diffusen und ihrem eigenen Anspruch nach klassenübergreifenden, bürokratischen und auf materielle Verteilungspolitik ausgerichteten politischen Apparaturen. Sie lösten die traditionellen, weltanschaulich und klassenmäßig ausgerichteten »bürgerlichen« und kommunistischsozialistischen Parteien allmählich ab. Der Fordismus ist auch die Ära der im weitesten Sinne »sozialdemokratisch« orientierten Reformparteien, die es sich zum Ziel setzten, mittels einer systematischen Wachstums-, Konjunktur- und Sozialpolitik eine allmähliche Verbesserung der Lebensverhältnisse breiter Schichten und eine Milderung kapitalistischer Risiken, Abhängigkeiten und Ungleichheiten zu erreichen. Die fordistische Regulationsweise beruhte demnach auf der Existenz umfassender gesellschaftlicher Großorganisationen, eines in weite gesell-schaftliche Bereiche intervenierenden Staates, bürokratischer Massenparteien, Gewerkschaften, Unternehmer-, Bauern-, Ärzte- und sonstigen Interessenverbänden, die den Anspruch erhoben, die kapitalistischen Marktprozesse ebenso wie die gesellschaftlichen Strukturen und Entwick-lungen durch zentralisierte Verhandlungen politisch zu steuern. Die Le-gitimation dieses politischen Systems beruhte auf seiner Fähigkeit, auf Grundlage eines beständigen wirtschaftlichen Wachstums materielle Ver-teilungspolitiken zugunsten fast aller gesellschaftlicher Schichten zu betreiben. Man bezeichnet diese Regulationsweise deshalb auch als »monopolistisch«. Charakteristisch für sie ist ein hoher Grad an zentralisierter Normierung und Steuerung, eine fortschreitende »Durchstaatlichung« vieler Lebensbereiche und ein erhebliches Maß an bürokratischer, partei- und verbandsmäßiger Kontrolle der Lebensweisen, des politischem Verhaltens, der Interessenartikulation und der Interessendurchsetzung. Der fordistische Staat war »Sicherheitsstaat« im doppelten Sinne des Wortes: als »Wohlfahrts«- und als bürokratischer »Kontroll- und Überwachungsstaat« (vgl. dazu Hirsch 1986, 1998).”翻译为中文","completion":"福特主义积累制度的实施导致社会状况变得更加一致，加入工资关系成为直接依赖于资本增值过程的普遍命运。在社会学中，这被解读为“水平化的中产阶级社会”的到来。工业女性工资劳动的扩张和小家庭化改变了性别关系。福特主义工业化、资本充分化、增长和大众消费模式的一个决定性基础，最终是对看似无限的自然资源的掌控。无限制的自然资源开发——以汽车化、石油消耗和空气污染的关联为例——与福特主义积累制度不可分割。 然而，这一切仅指代福特主义的一些普遍特征。尽管泰勒主义是福特主义积累制度的一个中心特征，对工作组织形式、阶级关系和生活方式有着重要影响，但它的实施是不均匀且不完全的。不仅不同国家之间存在着显著的差异，而且社会生产的重要部门如机械制造或大部分服务业由于现有技术无法进行泰勒式的合理化，因此最初被排除在外。这随着时间推移证明是生产力进步的一个重要障碍。 福特主义积累制度之所以能够成功实施，是因为在社会斗争过程中和鉴于系统竞争条件下力量关系的变化，调节方式被根本性地重构。传统的生产和生活方式的消失、工资关系的普及以及家庭形式的变化带来了大量的社会风险——比如疾病、失业和老年问题——这些都使得集体社会保护措施变得必要。至少在资本主义大都市，且在非常不同的程度上，成功推动了社会国家的发展。这些斗争的成功首先被证明是福特主义积累制度稳定性的一个重要因素。引入社会保障不仅用于维持劳动力的身体健康，平息阶级冲突，而且还是稳定大众消费的一个重要手段。在普遍和标准化的工资劳动条件基础上，能够形成强大的跨界工会，在经济增长条件下，提供了改善收入和工作条件的一定空间。 “社会伙伴关系” 和 “公司化”即包括工会、企业协会和国家的集体谈判系统不同程度上得以实施，成为经济调控的重要基础。因此，福特主义调节方式包含了资本主义阶级对立的中央集权和国家介导的制度化。社会伙伴关系的谈判过程成为调节的重要组成部分，同时国家的社会和经济干预活动也在扩展。社会、增长、研究、工业和经济政策，财政支出和补贴以及不断扩展的宏观经济控制工具的应用——特别是在货币和财政政策领域——成为“凯恩斯主义”国家的特色。约翰·M·凯恩斯的宏观经济理论，证明了国家行政工具集用于稳定增长过程和避免周期性危机的必要性，开始了它的胜利之路。这一发展得到了“大众”或“人民党”的支持，即在意识形态上较为模糊且根据自身声称超越阶级的、官僚化且专注于物质分配政策的政治结构。它们逐渐取代了传统的、按世界观和阶级定位的“资产阶级”和共产主义社会主义党。福特主义也是广义上“社会民主”导向改革党派的时代，它们旨在通过系统的增长、经济和社会政策，逐渐改善广大群体的生活条件，减轻资本主义的风险、依赖和不平等。 因此，福特主义调节方式建立在包括广泛社会大组织、干预社会广泛领域的国家、官僚化的大众党、工会、企业家、农民、医生和其他利益团体在内的存在基础上，这些团体声称通过中央集权化的协商政治调控资本主义市场过程以及社会结构和发展。这一政治系统的合法性基于其能够在持续经济增长的基础上进行几乎惠及所有社会阶层的物质分配政策。因此，这种调节方式也被称为“垄断性”的。其特点是高度集中化的规范和控制，生活领域进一步的“国家化”以及高度的官僚化、党派和协会对生活方式、政治行为、利益表达和利益实现的控制。福特主义国家是“安全国家”的双重意义上：作为“福利”和官僚化的“控制与监视国家”（参见Hirsch 1986, 1998）。"},{"prompt":"请将“Es wäre jedoch falsch, anzunehmen, die Durchsetzung des fordistischen Akkumulationsregimes hätte diese Form der »monopolistischen« Regulation und des »keynesianischen Staates« automatisch nach sich gezogen. Vielmehr mussten sozialstaatliche Errungenschaften, gewerkschaftliche Organisations- und Verhandlungsmacht sowie »volksparteiliche« Reformpolitik in harten ökonomischen, sozialen und politischen Kämpfen durchgesetzt werden und erst die allmähliche Etablierung fordistischer Regulationsformen schuf die Voraussetzung dafür, dass das Akkumulationsregime bestands- und tragfähig wurde. Die Weltwirtschaftkrise der 1930er Jahre lässt sich darauf zurückführen, dass die in Teilen der Wirtschaft bereits in den 1920er Jahren durchgesetzten tayloristischen Formen der Produktions- und Arbeitsorganisation noch nicht mit einer ihnen entsprechenden, vor allem den Massenkonsum stabilisierenden Regulationsweise verbunden waren. Dies wurde erst allmählich durch den amerikanischen »New Deal« und den »Wohlfahrtsstaat« nordwesteuropäischen Typs nachgeholt und hatte die Oktoberrevolution, den Ost-West-Systemgegensatz und die gesellschaftlichen Zerrüttungen durch den zweiten Weltkrieg zur Grundlage. Von Anfang an bildete eine gigantische Rüstungsproduktion den entscheidenden Eckpfeiler des neuen Akkumula-tionsregimes. Der »Militärkeynesianismus«, d.h. staatliche Wirtschafts-ankurbelung durch Rüstungsaufträge, war einer seiner zentralen Stützpfeiler. Zugleich zwang aber die Systemkonkurrenz mit dem »sozialistischen Lager« die herrschenden Klassen der entwickelten kapitalistischen Länder zu sozialen Zugeständnissen, die sich als Mechanismus zur Stabilisierung des neuen und zunächst höchst profitablen Akkumulationsregimes erwiesen. Der Fordismus ist somit das Ergebnis höchst unterschiedlicher und gegensätzlicher Interessen und Strategien. Und er ist in entscheidendem Maße ein Produkt des kalten Krieges. Die fordistische Ära war schließlich durch einen tiefgreifenden Wandel der gesellschaftlichen Wertvorstellungen und Verhaltensorientierungen gekennzeichnet. Nicht nur bildete der Antikommunismus einen wichtigen ideologischen Kitt. Allgemein verbreitet war der Glaube an einen unendlichen Fortschritt im Sinne des materiellen Warenreichtums, an die politische Gestaltbarkeit aller gesellschaftlichen Verhältnisse, an die Wohltaten der technischen Entwicklung, an fortschreitende gesellschaftliche Gleichheit und das Vertrauen in eine staatsbürokratisch garantierte soziale Sicherheit. Gesellschaftliche Solidarität und die Eindämmung des Klassenkonflikts schien durch den Ausbau bürokratischer Regulierungsmechanismen und Vorsorgesysteme umsetzbar zu sein. Ein etatistischer Reformismus, die Vorstellung von einer positiven Veränderbarkeit der Gesellschaft mit Hilfe von Wahlen, Parteien und Staat wurde beherrschend. Dies kennzeichnet das hegemoniale Projekt des Fordismus. Seine Spuren lassen sich bis in die Bereiche der Ästhetik hinein verfolgen, zum Beispiel in der seriellen Kunst, Pop-Art, »neuer Sachlichkeit«, dem Funktionalismus in Städtebau und Architektur. Der Fordismus war die gesellschaftliche und ökonomische Grundlage der »Moderne«. Die volle, die Struktur des Kapitalismus im globalen Maßstab bestimmende Durchsetzung des Fordismus war an ein internationales Regulationssystem geknüpft, in der die Staaten eine zentrale Rolle spielten. In der Krise der 1930er Jahre war der internationale Goldstandard zusammengebrochen, der die nationalen Währungen an die jeweils verfügbaren Goldreserven gebunden hatte und den einzelnen Staaten nur geringe wirtschaftspolitische Spielräume ließ. Unter Führung der USA wurde 1944 das Abkommen von Bretton Woods geschlossen, das zur Errichtung des Internationalen Währungsfonds (IWF) und der Weltbank führte und das Ziel verfolgte, die zusammengebrochenen internationalen Handelsbeziehungen wiederherzustellen und den ökonomischen Wiederaufbau der kriegszerstörten Länder zu unterstützen (Copur/Schneider 2004). Das vom Zwang der Golddeckung befreite internationale Kreditgeldsystem ermöglichte im jeweiligen einzelstaatlichen Rahmen eine vergleichsweise eigenständige, von externen Zwängen zunächst einmal relativ unabhängige Geldpolitik. Da die quasi automatische Geldmengenregulierung durch den Goldstandard wegfiel, ging die Aufgabe der Festsetzung von Währungsparitäten, die Bestimmung von Konvertibilitätsregeln und die Kontrolle des Kreditschöpfungsspielraums der Banken an die einzelnen Staaten bzw. ihre Zentralbanken über. Das war eine wesentliche Voraussetzung für eine eigenständige, »nationale« Wirtschafts- und Sozialpolitik. »Niemals zuvor war der Raum des Kapitals so eng mit dem nationalen Institutionensystem, charakterisiert durch die Gültigkeit des rechtlich geregelten Kreditgeldes und wohlfahrtsstaatlicher Einkommensumverteilung zusammengefallen.« (Lipietz 1994, 38) Das Kreditgeldsystem war insofern eine entscheidende Grundlage der fordistischen Akkumulationsund Regulationsweise, als damit auch erst die Voraussetzungen für inflationsträchtige monopolistische Preisbildungsprozesse, »sozialpartnerschaftliche« Tarifpolitik sowie eine oftmals in hohem Maß schuldenfinanzierte Ausdehnung des Massenkonsums und der sozialen Sicherungssysteme möglich wurde (Guttmann 1994). Diese »Nationalisierung« der Ökonomien schuf die Grundlage für relativ eigenständige Akkumulations- und Regulationszusammenhänge auf einzelstaatlicher Ebene, erforderte aber zugleich neue Formen der inter-nationalen Regulation. Vor allem die USA waren daran interessiert, den in der Krise der dreißiger Jahre und dem darauf folgenden protektionistischen Wettlauf zusammengebrochenen Welthandel neu zu beleben und der Kapitalakkumulation im Weltmarktrahmen wieder eine sichere Basis zu verleihen. So konnte ihre eigene ökonomische Expansion gewährleistet und ihre politische Einflusssphäre stabilisiert werden. Der Internationale Währungsfonds wurde, zusammen mit der Weltbank, zur Garantieinstanz eines Systems fester, die nationalen Währungen in bestimmten Austauschrelationen festschreibender Wechselkurse, weil er im Falle vorübergehender Zahlungsbilanzdefizite Kredite an die einzelnen Staaten gewähren konnte. Die Weltbank hatte die Aufgabe, die ökonomische Entwicklung zurückgebliebener Länder durch günstige Kredite zu unterstützen. Mit dem GATT (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) wurde schließlich eine Einrichtung geschaffen, die einen allmählichen Abbau protektionistischer Zoll- und Handelsschranken vorantrieb. Die Vereinigten Staaten erklärten sich bereit, das System der internationalen Geld- und Kreditregulation mit ihrem wirtschaftlichen Potenzial zu stützen. Der US-Dollar, der als einzige Währung zunächst noch in bestimmtem Umfang an das Gold gebunden blieb, wurde damit faktisch zum Weltgeld. Die internationalen Liquiditätsengpässe, die durch den andauernden Außenhandelsüberschuss der Vereinigten Staaten in den Nachkriegsjahren verursacht wurde, konnten damit bis zu einem gewissen Grad ausgeglichen werden. Dies schuf zugleich eine sichere Grundlage für beständige und hohe amerikanische Kapitalexporte. Das internationale Regulationssystem des Fordismus basierte auf der Vorstellung, dass es möglich sei, unter der Führung der USA eine relativ gleichgewichtige Entwicklung des kapitalistischen Teils der Welt zu garantieren und durch einen zunehmend liberalisierten Welthandel dem globalen Akkumulationsprozess eine neue, stabile Grundlage zu verschaf-fen. Die hohen Direktinvestitionen der USA im Ausland führten dazu, dass sich das fordistische Akkumulationsregime ausbreiten konnte. Damit etablierte sich ein globaler Akkumulationsprozess, der zugleich in relativ hohem Maß einzelstaatlich und durch staatliche politische Übereinkünfte und Institutionen reguliert blieb. Obwohl der Fordismus auf internationaler Ebene eine Reihe gemeinsamer Strukturmerkmale und Entwicklungstendenzen aufwies, konnten sich unter der Wirksamkeit der jeweiligen nationalen Akkumulationsund Regulationsweisen in den verschiedenen Staaten und Regionen durchaus unterschiedliche Wachstums- und Entwicklungsmodelle herausbilden. Die sozialstaatliche Entwicklung und der planmäßige Staatsinterventionismus waren in Nord-Westeuropa angesichts der dort herrschenden gesellschaftlichen Kräfteverhältnissen sehr viel stärker ausgeprägt als beispielsweise in den USA. Davon hob sich das durch hoch entwickelte und fest installierte korporative Strukturen gekennzeichnete »Modell Deutschland« noch einmal besonders ab. Ebenso konnte sich in Japan ein relativ eigenständiges fordistisches Akkumulations- und Regulationsmodell entwickeln. Die USA wiesen infolge ihrer ökonomisch beherrschenden Position einen sehr viel geringeren Grad an korporativ und staatlich vermittelter Regulierung der wirtschaftlichen und gesellschaftlichen Prozesse auf. Vor allem fand hier eine weltmarktorientierte staatliche Industriepolitik außerhalb des militärisch-industriellen Komplexes praktisch überhaupt nicht statt.”翻译为中文","completion":"然而，认为福特主义积累制度的实施自动导致了“垄断性”调节和“凯恩斯主义国家”形式的出现是错误的。相反，社会福利成就、工会的组织和谈判力量以及“大众政党”的改革政策，都必须通过艰苦的经济、社会和政治斗争来实现，而福特主义调节形态的逐步建立才为积累制度的持续和可行性创造了条件。1930年代的世界经济危机可以追溯到20世纪20年代部分经济部门已经实施的泰勒主义生产和劳动组织形式，尚未与之匹配的、主要是稳定大众消费的调节方式尚未建立。这种情况直到美国的“新政”和西北欧式的“福利国家”逐渐弥补，而十月革命、东西系统对立以及二战带来的社会动荡成为其基础。从一开始，巨大的军备生产就构成了新积累制度的决定性支柱。“军事凯恩斯主义”，即通过军事订单来刺激国家经济，是其核心支柱之一。同时，与“社会主义阵营”的系统竞争迫使发达资本主义国家的统治阶级做出社会让步，这成为稳定新的、最初极为有利可图的积累制度的机制。因此，福特主义是极为不同和相互对立的利益及策略的结果。并且，在很大程度上是冷战的产物。 福特主义时代最终被一系列深刻的社会价值观念和行为取向的变化所特征化。不仅反共产主义构成了重要的意识形态粘合剂。普遍存在着对物质商品丰富无限进步的信仰，对所有社会关系可通过政治手段塑造的信仰，对技术发展的好处、社会逐渐平等化及对国家官僚保障的社会安全的信任。通过扩建官僚管制机制和预防体系似乎能实现社会团结和抑制阶级冲突。一种国家改革主义成为主导，即通过选举、政党和国家的帮助可以积极改变社会的观念。这标志着福特主义的霸权项目。它的痕迹甚至可以追溯到美学领域，例如连续性艺术、波普艺术、“新客观性”、城市规划和建筑的功能主义。福特主义是“现代性”的社会和经济基础。 福特主义在全球范围内确定资本主义结构的全面实施，与一个中央国家发挥关键作用的国际调节系统相连。在1930年代的危机中，国际金本位制崩溃，该制度将各国货币与各自可用的黄金储备挂钩，仅留给各国非常有限的经济政策空间。在美国的领导下，1944年签订了《布雷顿森林协议》，建立了国际货币基金组织（IMF）和世界银行，旨在恢复崩溃的国际贸易关系并支持战后国家的经济重建（Copur/Schneider 2004）。脱离黄金强制的国际信贷货币系统，在一定程度上使个别国家能够实施相对独立的、最初相对不受外部压力影响的货币政策。由于金本位制下的自动货币量调节机制消失，货币汇率的设定、兑换率规则的确定和对银行信贷创造空间的控制任务转交给了各国及其中央银行。这为独立的“国家”经济和社会政策提供了一个重要先决条件。“以往，资本的空间从未如此紧密地与以法定信贷货币有效性和福利国家收入再分配为特征的国家体制相合并。”（Lipietz 1994, 38）信贷货币系统因此成为福特主义积累和调节方式的一个决定性基础，它也首次为通胀倾向的垄断性价格形成过程、“社会合作伙伴”式的工资政策以及往往高度债务融资的大众消费和社会保障制度的扩张提供了条件（Guttmann 1994）。 这种“国家化”的经济为在单个国家水平上相对独立的积累和调节情况创造了基础，但同时也要求新形式的国际调节。尤其是美国有兴趣重振30年代危机和随后的保护主义竞赛导致崩溃的世界贸易，并为全球范围内的资本积累再次提供稳定的基础。因此，可以保证自身的经济扩张并稳固其政治影响范围。国际货币基金组织，连同世界银行，成为一个固定的汇率制度的担保机构，该制度将各国货币限定在特定的兑换关系内，因为它可以在暂时的支付平衡赤字情况下向各国提供贷款。世界银行的任务是通过优惠贷款支持落后国家的经济发展。通过GATT（关贸总协定）最终创建了一个机构，推动逐步削减保护主义的关税和贸易壁垒。美国承诺以其经济实力支撑国际货币和信贷调节体系。美元，作为唯一仍然在一定程度上与黄金挂钩的货币，从而实际上成为了世界货币。美国持续的对外贸易顺差在战后年份引起的国际流动性短缺，在一定程度上得以弥补。这同时为持续且高额的美国资本输出创造了稳定基础。 福特主义的国际调节系统基于在美国领导下可以保障资本主义世界部分相对平衡发展的想法，并通过日益自由化的世界贸易为全球积累过程提供新的、稳定的基础。美国在海外的高额直接投资导致福特主义积累制度得以扩散。从而建立了一个同时在相对高度国家化和通过国家政治协定和机构调节的全球积累过程。 尽管福特主义在国际层面上展示了一系列共同的结构特征和发展趋势，但在各国和地区特定国家积累和调节方式的作用下，不同的增长和发展模式得以形成。在北欧由于那里的社会力量关系，社会福利发展和有计划的国家干预主义得到了更强烈的表现，相比之下，例如在美国。特别是被高度发达和固定的企业结构特征的“德国模式”又尤其突出。同样，日本也能够发展出一个相对独立的福特主义积累和调节模式。由于经济上的主导地位，美国的企业和国家介导的经济和社会过程的调节程度较低。尤其是，除了军工复合体之外，几乎没有进行全球市场导向的国家工业政策。"},{"prompt":"请将“Noch größer waren die Unterschiede in der kapitalistischen Peripherie. Vor allem einige lateinamerikanische Länder versuchten, mit einer protektionistischen Importsubstitution, d.h. einer Industriepolitik, die die inländische Produktion von Massenkonsumgütern förderte, eine Entwick-lungsstrategie einzuschlagen, die auf eine Kopie des fordistischen Akku- mulations- und Regulationsmodells hinauslief. Infolge des starken Wachstums in den Zentren mit dem entsprechenden Bedarf an Rohstoffen und einfachen Industrieerzeugnissen erschien diese zunächst als aussichtsreich, scheiterte aber schließlich nicht zuletzt an den in vielen Teilen der Peripherie herrschenden gesellschaftlichen und politischen Strukturen (Hirsch 1993). In einigen südostasiatischen Regionen bildete sich ein »blutiger Taylorismus« (Lipietz 1987, 69ff.) heraus, bei dem sich tayloristische Massenproduktion mit extremer Arbeitskraftausbeutung und dem weitgehenden Fehlen sozialstaatlicher Regulation verband. Dennoch entwik- kelten sich in den sogenannten Tigerstaaten Akkumulations- und Regulationsmodelle, die ungeachtet wichtiger Differenzen - insbesondere was demokratische und sozialstaatliche Strukturen angeht - sich eher den Verhältnissen in den kapitalistischen Zentren anglichen. Maßgebend dafür waren einerseits ihre Stellung als »Frontstaaten« im Kalten Krieg, die hohe amerikanische Wirtschaftshilfen nach sich zog, aber auch ihre besonderen politisch-sozialen Strukturen, beispielsweise das Fehlen einer Großgrundbesitzeroligarchie als Folge durchgeführter Bodenreformen, ein besseres Ausbildungssystem und eine starke, von den gesellschaftlichen Klassen relativ unabhängige Position der Staatsapparate. Dies gestattete es ihnen auch, nach dem durch die Krise des Fordismus verursachten Scheitern der Importsubstitutionspolitik eine zum Teil relativ erfolgreiche Strategie der Exportdiversifizierung einzuleiten. Viele Länder, besonders in Afrika, blieben allerdings von dieser Entwicklung weit-gehend unberührt und behielten - wenn überhaupt - im Rahmen der in-ternationalen Arbeitsteilung die Position einfacher Rohstofflieferanten. Wenn also von einem »peripheren Fordismus« (Lipietz) gesprochen werden kann, dann nur insofern, als die ökonomische und soziale Entwicklung der kapitalistischen Peripherie stark von der Durchsetzung der for- distischen Akkumulations- und Regulationsweise in den Zentren bestimmt wurde. Noch weniger als in diesen kam es aber zu relativ einheitlichen sozialen, ökonomischen und politischen Verhältnissen. Der globale Fordismus blieb also gerade wegen seiner ökonomischsozialen Struktur und wegen der Eigenart seiner internationalen Regulation durch erhebliche Unterschiede in den nationalen Entwicklungs- und Wachstumsmodellen bestimmt. Dies ließ es auch zu, dass sich in einigen Ländern - insbesondere in Westeuropa und Japan - eigene fordistische Akkumulations- und Regulationsweisen herausbilden und erfolgreich werden konnten. Dies stellte die ökonomische Dominanz der USA in Frage und untergrub das fordistische System der internationalen Regulation. Nicht zuletzt diese Entwicklung war es, die schließlich zur Krise des Fordismus führte. Die Krise des Fordismus Die Krise des fordistischen Kapitalismus, deren erste Anzeichen sich Ende der 1960er Jahre bemerkbar machten und die Mitte der 1970er Jahre offen ausbrach, kann nicht auf einen einfachen Verursachungszusammenhang zurückgeführt werden. Sie muss mit den komplexen ökonomischen, gesellschaftlichen und politischen Dynamiken erklärt werden, die in die Struktur dieser Akkumulations- und Regulationsweise sowohl auf nationaler wie auch auf internationaler Ebene eingelassen waren. Es war eine ganze Reihe voneinander relativ unabhängiger Prozesse, die sich zu einer Krise der gesamten Formation verdichteten. Dabei ist vor allem der Zusammenhang und die wechselseitige Verstärkung von krisenträchtigen Entwicklungen auf einzelstaatlicher und internationaler Ebene von Bedeutung. Im Kern wurde die Krise des Fordismus durch einen strukturellen Rückgang der Kapitalrentabilität in allen kapitalistischen Metropolen verursacht (Lipietz 1987, 29ff.; Hirsch/Roth 1986, 78ff.; Marglin/Schor 1991). Der - wenn auch branchenmäßig und nach Ländern unterschiedlich starke - Rückgang des Kapitalprofits kann jedoch nicht allein unter Rückgriff auf allgemeine ökonomische Gesetzlichkeiten, sondern nur unter Berücksichtigung der Gesamtstruktur dieser Gesellschaftsformation zureichend erklärt werden. Grundlegend dafür war, dass sich die im fordistisch-tayloristischen Akkumulationsregime liegenden Produktivitätsreserven allmählich zu erschöpfen begannen. Einen offenen krisenhaften Charakter erhielt dieser Prozess aber erst dadurch, dass er die Fundamente des herrschenden staatsinterventionistischen Regulationsmodus untergrub. Der institutionalisierte sozialstaatliche Verteilungsmechanismus und die strukturkonservierenden Subventionspolitiken der monopolistischen Regulation konnten nicht mehr aus starken Sozialproduktszuwächsen finanziert werden und erzeugten damit ihrerseits einen zusätzlichen und immer mehr wachsenden Druck auf den Kapitalprofit. Abnehmende Wachstumsraten und eine steigende Staatsverschuldung führten zu der für den Fordismus charakteristischen Verbindung von Stagnation und Inflation (»Stagflation«). Die fordistische, sozialstaatlich- keynesianische Regulationsweise, die über Jahre hinweg eine Stütze der Kapitalakkumulation dargestellt hatte, wurde jetzt zu deren Hemmnis (Guttmann 1994). Die enge Verbindung von Massenkonsum, Sozialstaat und Akkumulation, die das »goldene Zeitalter« des Fordismus gekennzeichnet hatte, zerbrach. Die Ursachen der Krise lagen allerdings nicht nur im Inneren der einzelnen Ökonomien, die von der Krise zunächst auch in höchst unterschiedlichem Ausmaß betroffen waren. Sie müssen vielmehr auch in einer wachsenden Destabilisierung der internationalen Regulation gesucht werden, die wiederum auf die ökonomischen Prozesse innerhalb der einzelnen Länder zurückwirkte. Das aufgrund seiner hohen Arbeitsproduktivität international konkurrenzfähige US-Kapital war stark an der Liberalisierung des Welthandels und einer Öffnung neuer Investitionsgebiete interessiert. Die Liberalisierung der Märkte und die wachsende Internationalisierung des Kapitals setzten der für das fordistische Akkumulationsregime typischen Binnenmarktorientierung allmählich ein Ende. Multinationale Unternehmungen wurden zu immer bestimmenderen ökonomischen Akteuren. Innerhalb der einzelnen Ökonomien nahm die Bedeutung des Exportsektors zu, was dazu führte, dass die Verwertung des Kapitals von der Entwicklung der Masseneinkommen im nationalen Rahmen nicht nur unabhängiger, sondern zugleich auch die Höhe der Löhne als Kostenfaktor im internationalen Wettbewerb wichtiger wurden (Dunford 1990, 317ff.). Dies berührte auch Länder wie die Bundesrepublik Deutschland, deren ökonomische Stabilität schon immer auf einem starken Exportsektor und anhaltenden Außenhandelsüberschüssen beruht hatte. Die internationalen Handels- und Kapitalströme gerieten immer mehr aus dem Gleichgewicht und der auf den Institutionen des BrettonWoods-Systems beruhende internationale Regulationsmodus kam ins Wanken (Guttmann 1994). Dessen schließlicher Zusammenbruch hing erheblich damit zusammen, dass die USA ihre auf ökonomischem Gebiet international beherrschende Stellung allmählich verloren und einige europäische Staaten sowie Japan einen erfolgreichen wirtschaftlichen Aufholprozess in Gang gesetzt hatten (Altvater 1992, 23ff.). Auf die Liberalisierung des Welthandels gestützt, auch durch amerikanische Technologie- und Kapitalexporte fordistisch modernisiert, hatten die ökonomisch wieder erstarkten und mit den USA konkurrierenden kapitalistischen Zentren vergleichsweise hohe Produktivitätsfortschritte erzielt und dies mit einem viel dichteren und vergleichsweise effektiven System staatsinterventionistischer Regulierung verbunden. Ihr Erfolg beruhte nicht so sehr darauf, dass sie das US-amerikanische Gesellschaftsmodell einfach kopierten, sondern dass es ihnen ihre internen gesellschaftlichen und politischen Strukturen erlaubten, alternative Ausprägungen fordistischer Akkumulations- und Regulationsweisen zu entwickeln und diese erfolgreich mit dem Weltmarkt zu verbinden. Damit wurde die internationale Konkurrenzposition der USA allmählich untergraben (Li- pietz 1987, 39ff.). Verschärft wurde diese Entwicklung durch die ökonomische Überlastung, die der kapitalistischen Führungsmacht durch die Aufrechterhaltung ihres gigantischen Militärapparates erwuchs (Kennedy 1989). Nicht zu Unrecht gilt der unter großen Verlusten verlorengegangene Vietnamkrieg als Auslöser des Hegemonieverlusts der USA und als Markstein der Fordismus-Krise.”翻译为中文","completion":"在资本主义边缘地区，差异更为显著。特别是一些拉丁美洲国家尝试通过保护性的进口替代政策，即一种促进国内大众消费品生产的工业政策，采取了一种旨在复制福特主义积累和调节模式的发展策略。由于中心地区的强劲增长及其对原材料和简单工业产品的相应需求，这最初看似有前景，但最终由于许多边缘地区普遍存在的社会和政治结构而失败（Hirsch 1993）。在一些东南亚地区形成了所谓的“血腥泰勒主义”（Lipietz 1987, 69ff.），泰勒主义的大规模生产与极端的劳动力剥削以及几乎缺乏社会福利调节相结合。尽管如此，在所谓的“亚洲四小龙”国家发展了积累和调节模式，虽存在重要差异——特别是在民主和社会福利结构方面——但更趋近于资本主义中心地区的情况。其决定性因素一方面是它们作为冷战“前线国家”的地位，这带来了巨额的美国经济援助，另一方面是它们的特殊政治社会结构，例如由于实施了土地改革，没有形成大地主寡头统治，拥有更好的教育系统以及国家机构在相对独立于社会阶级的强大地位。这也使得它们能够在福特主义危机导致进口替代政策失败之后，启动部分相对成功的出口多样化策略。然而，许多国家，特别是在非洲，几乎未受到这一发展的影响，保持了在国际分工中仅作为简单原材料供应商的地位。因此，如果要谈论所谓的“边缘福特主义”（Lipietz），仅在福特主义积累和调节方式在中心地区的实施对资本主义边缘地区的经济和社会发展产生了重大影响的程度上。这些地区与中心地区相比，更难形成相对统一的社会、经济和政治状况。 正因为其经济社会结构和国际调节的特定性，全球福特主义正是由国家发展和增长模式的重大差异所决定。这也使得一些国家——特别是在西欧和日本——能够形成并成功实施自己的福特主义积累和调节方式。这挑战了美国的经济主导地位，动摇了福特主义的国际调节体系。正是这一发展，最终导致了福特主义的危机。 福特主义危机 福特主义资本主义的危机，其首个迹象在1960年代末显现，到1970年代中期爆发，不能归结于简单的因果关系。必须用嵌入其中的复杂经济、社会和政治动力，无论是在国家还是国际层面，来解释这种积累和调节方式的结构。一系列相对独立的过程累积形成了整个形态的危机。尤其重要的是国家和国际层面上危机倾向发展的联系和相互加强。 福特主义的危机核心是所有资本主义大都市的资本收益率结构性下降（Lipietz 1987, 29ff.; Hirsch/Roth 1986, 78ff.; Marglin/Schor 1991）。尽管资本利润的下降在不同行业和国家有所不同，但这无法仅仅依靠一般经济规律来解释，而需要考虑到这一社会形态的整体结构。基本原因是福特-泰勒主义积累制度中的生产率储备逐渐耗尽。但这一过程之所以具有开放的危机性质，是因为它破坏了现有的国家干预主义调节模式的基础。体制化的社会福利分配机制和垄断调节中的结构保守补贴政策，无法再通过强劲的社会产品增长来资助，从而对资本利润造成了额外且不断增长的压力。增长率下降和国家债务上升导致了福特主义特有的停滞和通货膨胀（“滞胀”）相结合。多年来支撑资本积累的福特主义、社会福利-凯恩斯主义调节方式，现在变成了其障碍（Guttmann 1994）。大众消费、社会福利和积累之间的紧密联系，标志着福特主义的“黄金时代”，现在破裂了。 危机的原因不仅存在于各个经济体内部，这些经济体最初也受危机影响的程度极为不同。更需要在国际调节日益不稳定中寻找，这反过来又影响了各国内部的经济过程。由于其高劳动生产率，在国际上具有竞争力的美国资本强烈关注世界贸易的自由化和新投资领域的开放。市场自由化和资本的日益国际化逐渐结束了福特主义积累制度典型的内向型市场导向。跨国公司变成了越来越重要的经济行动者。在各个经济体内，出口部门的重要性增加，导致资本的增值不再仅依赖于国内大众收入的发展，同时工资作为国际竞争中的成本因素变得更为重要（Dunford 1990, 317ff.）。这也影响了像德国这样的国家，其经济稳定历来依赖于强大的出口部门和持续的对外贸易顺差。国际贸易和资本流动日益失衡，基于布雷顿森林体系的国际调节模式动摇（Guttmann 1994）。 其最终崩溃与美国逐渐丧失其在经济领域的国际主导地位及一些欧洲国家和日本成功启动的经济追赶过程有着重要联系（Altvater 1992, 23ff.）。 依靠世界贸易的自由化，以及通过美国的技术和资本出口福特主义地现代化，与美国竞争并经济上重新强大的资本主义中心，实现了相对较高的生产率进步，并将这与较为密集且相对有效的国家干预主义调节相结合。它们的成功并非简单地复制美国的社会模式，而是它们内部的社会和政治结构允许它们发展福特主义积累和调节方式的替代形式，并成功地与世界市场相连。这逐渐削弱了美国的国际竞争地位（Lipietz 1987, 39ff.）。这一发展受到了资本主义领导力量维持其庞大军事机器所带来的经济负担的加剧（Kennedy 1989）。美国在付出巨大损失的越南战争中的失败，被认为是美国霸权失落的触发因素，也是福特主义危机的里程碑。"},{"prompt":"请将“Sich vergrößernde Handels- und Zahlungsbilanzdefizite und die wachsende internationale Verschuldung der USA bewirkten eine Schwächung des Dollars und stellten seine Funktion als stabiles Weltgeld in Frage. Die US-Regierung war letztlich dazu gezwungen, die Golddeckung ihrer Währung aufzugeben, was Anfang der 1970er Jahre zum Zusammenbruch des Bretton-Woods-Systems führte. Damit war der institutionalisierten politischen Regulierung des Weltmarkts eine entscheidende Grundlage entzogen (vgl. dazu ausführlicher Strange 1986, 25ff.; Dunford 1990 sowie Guttmann 1994). Das System der festen, durch Staaten und internationale Institutionen gestützten und kontrollierten Wechselkurse zerbrach. Eine wichtige Ursache für die Krise des internationalen Kredit- und Finanzsystems lag in dem Überschuss an liquiden Mitteln, der durch die zunehmenden ökonomischen Stagnationsprozesse hervorgerufen wurde. Diese wanderten in Form von »Euro«- oder »Petro-Dollars« in gewaltigen Summen und staatlich weitgehend unkontrolliert über die nationalen Grenzen hinweg. Dadurch blähten sich die internationalen Kreditmärkte in einem Umfang auf, der weit über dem Zuwachs der Produktion lag. Ebenso nahmen die spekulativen Wechselkursschwankungen zu. Die Zentralbanken begannen ihrerseits, eine immer unabhängigere Geld- und Kreditpolitik zu betreiben. Insbesondere Deutschland und Japan verfolgten frühzeitig und ohne Rücksicht auf die Stabilität des kapitalistischen Weltmarkts eine rigorose, auf vergleichsweise rigide Geld- und Kreditkontrollen sowie systematische Exportförderung gegründete Wettbewerbs- und »Standort«-Politik. Dies vergrößerte die internationalen Instabilitäten zusätzlich. Als Folge des Zusammenbruchs der internationalen Regulation geriet die Steuerung des Geld-, Kredit- und Devisenverkehrs immer stärker in die Hände privater Banken und Finanzunternehmen und unterlag damit zunehmend deren kurzfristigen und spekulativen Profitinteressen (Altvater 1992). Die Gewinnerzielung nicht aus produktiven Investitionen, sondern durch Ausnutzung von Wertpapier-, Wechselkurs- und Zinsdifferenzen wurde immer bedeutsamer - ein Vorgang, der nicht ganz unzutreffend mit dem Begriff »Casino-Kapitalismus« charakterisiert wurde (Strange 1986). Der Dollar war dadurch »nicht mehr reguliertes Weltgeld, also Medium der Steuerung des Weltmarkts durch politische Instanzen, sondern Vehikel zur Durchsetzung privater Interessen auf den internationalen Finanzmärkten« (Altvater 1987, 233f.). Der Internationale Währungsfonds hatte als Regulationsinstanz des internationalen Geld- und Kapitalverkehrs praktisch ausgedient. Während er zuvor so etwas wie die Rolle einer übergeordneten Zentralbank in einem »keynesianischen«, auf Vollbeschäftigung und Wohlstandssteigerung abzielenden internationalen Regulationszusammenhang gespielt hatte, verwandelte er sich nun in eine Art gemeinsamer Kreditüberwachungsbehörde der mächtigen staatlichen und privaten Banken. Er fungierte immer mehr als Interessenvertretung privater und öffentlicher Gläubiger gegenüber einer Reihe von Staaten, die sich auf den entregulierten Finanzmärkten hoch verschuldet hatten. Ihnen wurden wirtschafts- und sozialpolitische Auflagen diktiert, mit denen die Aufbringung des Schuldendienstes und die wirtschaftspolitische Öffnung gegenüber dem Weltmarkt durchgesetzt werden (ebd., 29, 270). Auf diese Weise wurde die Internationalisierung des Kapitals weiter vorangetrieben. Die Folgen dieser »Strukturanpassungspolitik« - Abbau ohnehin dürftiger sozialer Sicherungen, Ruin der kleinen Landwirtschaft, Verarmung, sich verschärfende soziale Ungleichheiten und Konflikte - waren nicht mehr zu übersehen. Die Schuldenkrise in der kapitalistischen Peripherie stand in einem engen Zusammenhang mit der Krise in den Metropolen. Einerseits ließ das dort nachlassende ökonomische Wachstum die Nachfrage nach Rohstoffen und einfacheren Industriegütern zurückgehen, was die importsubstituierende Entwicklungs- und Industrialisierungspolitik der peripheren Länder in noch größere Schwierigkeiten brachte und sie mit zunehmenden Handels- und Zahlungsbilanzdefiziten konfrontierte. Auf der anderen Seite schuf der spekulative Überschuss liquider Mittel auf den internationalen Finanzmärkten, der sich aufgrund zunehmender Verwertungsschwierigkeiten in den Metropolen ansammelte, das Reservoir für eine gigantische und kaum noch kontrollierte Kreditvergabe gerade auch privater Banken an viele periphere Länder, mit denen diese ihre ökonomischen Schwierigkeiten noch eine Zeit lang überdecken konnten. Da das einfließende Geld weniger zum Um- und Ausbau der Produktionsapparate und eher zum Profittransfer ins Ausland, zur Subventionierung des Mittelschichtkonsums und zum Ausbau der Repressionsinstrumente benutzt wurde, konnten die strukturellen Ungleichgewichte damit in keiner Weise beseitigt werden. Der unumgängliche Kollaps dieses Schuldensystems wurde dadurch ausgelöst, dass Anfang der 1980er Jahre die Reagan-Administration in den USA eine neokonservativ-monetaristische wirtschaftspolitische Wende vollzog und versuchte, die sowohl ökonomisch wie militärisch bedrohte Vorherrschaft der USA mittels eines gigantischen Aufrüstungsprogramms wieder herzustellen. Der so genannte Volcker-Schock (1979/89), d.h. eine radikale Geldmengenverknappung und Zinserhöhung markierte den Beginn der von den USA ausgehenden neoliberalen Globalisierungsoffensive (Panitch/Gindin 2004a). Damit war beabsichtigt, die Politik verstärkt einer finanziellen Disziplin zu unterwerfen und demokratischer Interessenpolitik einen Riegel vorzuschieben. Diese finanzielle Disziplinierung traf zunächst vor allem die hochverschuldeten Ländern der Peripherie. Die Zinserhöhung und der starke Anstieg des Dollarkurses machte ihnen Zinszahlungen und Kredittilgungen nun vollends unmöglich. Auf diese Weise schlug die Krise des Fordismus, die in den 1970er Jahren in den kapitalistischen Zentren eingesetzt hatte, erst mit einer gewissen zeitlichen Verzögerung, dann allerdings mit noch gravierenderen Wirkungen auf die kapitalistische Peripherie durch (vgl. dazu ausführlicher Hirsch 1993). Die Krise des Fordismus hat allerdings nicht nur ökonomische und politische Ursachen, sondern beruht auch darauf, dass diese Entwicklungen mit einem Zerbröseln des ideologischen Kitts verbunden waren, der diese Gesellschaftsformation zusammenhielt. Der durch Bürokratisierung, Reglementierung und Normierung gekennzeichnete »Sicherheitsstaat«, der auf standardisierten Warenkonsum gegründete Wohlstand, die ausufernde Ressourcenverschwendung und Naturzerstörung sowie die for- distisch - durch wachsende Frauenerwerbstätigkeit und Kleinfamiliari- sierung - modifizierte Form patriarchaler Herrschaft wurden Ziel einer wachsenden Kritik, die in einem beginnenden allgemeinen »Wertewandel« und in den sich seit dem Ende der 1960er Jahre herausbildenden »neuen sozialen Bewegungen« ihren Ausdruck fand (vgl. dazu Hirsch/Roth 1986; Roth 1994) Die »Ölkrise« Mitte der 1970er Jahre war zwar keinesfalls die Ursache der Weltwirtschaftskrise, sondern eher eine Folge der Preisstrategie der OPEC und der großen Mineralölkonzerne, hatte aber eine erhebliche symbolische, die Endlichkeit der Naturressourcen deutlich machende Bedeutung. Ökonomische Krisenerscheinungen, das Zerbröckeln des Sozialstaats und das Ende des einstmals für unendlich gehaltenen ökonomischen Wachstums verbanden sich im Kontext neuer Wertorientierungen und Protestbewegungen zu der sich allmählich ausbreitenden Überzeugung, dass das fordistische Gesellschaftsmodell - seine ökonomischen Strukturen und die von ihm bestimmten Lebensverhältnisse - keine Perspektive mehr habe. Die Krise des Fordismus war also nicht nur eine Krise der Kapitalverwertung, sondern damit verbunden auch eine der Hegemonie, die sich in allen ihren Dimensionen bemerkbar machte: Ideologisch wurde sie durch den Zerfall bis dahin herrschender Wertvorstellungen, politisch durch die Erosion der USA-Dominanz und institutionell durch die Transformation der Staaten und der internationalen Organisationen in Frage gestellt.”翻译为中文","completion":"不断增加的贸易和经常账户赤字及美国日益增长的国际债务导致美元贬值，并质疑了其作为稳定世界货币的功能。美国政府最终被迫放弃其货币黄金兑换，这在1970年代初导致了布雷顿森林体系的崩溃。从而剥夺了世界市场政治调节的一个决定性基础（参见Strange 1986, 25ff.; Dunford 1990以及Guttmann 1994）。固定汇率制度，由国家和国际机构支持和控制的制度瓦解了。国际信贷和金融系统危机的一个重要原因在于由不断增加的经济停滞过程引发的过剩流动性。这些过剩资金以“欧元”或“石油美元”等形式，以巨大金额跨越国界，几乎不受国家控制。因此国际信贷市场膨胀到远远超过生产增长的程度。同样，投机性汇率波动也在增加。中央银行开始采取越来越独立的货币和信贷政策。特别是德国和日本早期毫不考虑资本主义世界市场稳定地采取了严格的货币和信贷控制以及系统性的出口促进策略。这进一步增加了国际不稳定性。 国际调节体系崩溃的结果是，货币、信贷和外汇交易的管理日益落入私人银行和金融公司手中，从而越来越受制于它们短期和投机性的利润追求（Altvater 1992）。通过利用证券、汇率和利差赚取利润变得日益重要 - 这个过程被“赌场资本主义”一词相当恰当地描述（Strange 1986）。美元“不再是受政治实体控制的世界货币，即世界市场的调控媒介，而是成为在国际金融市场上实现私人利益的工具”（Altvater 1987, 233f.）。 国际货币基金组织作为国际货币和资本流动的调节机构已经基本失效。尽管以前它扮演着类似于一个“凯恩斯主义”国际调节背景下促进全就业和财富增长的超级中央银行的角色，现在它却变成了强大的国家和私人银行的共同信贷监管机构。它越来越多地充当私人和公共债权人对一些在非管制金融市场上负债累累的国家的利益代表。这些国家被强加了经济和社会政策要求，以实施偿还债务的筹资和对世界市场的经济开放（同上，29, 270）。通过这种方式，资本的国际化进一步推进。这种“结构调整政策”的后果 - 减少本已不足的社会保障、农村小户的破产、贫困、日益加剧的社会不平等和冲突 - 已显而易见。 资本主义边缘地区的债务危机与中心地区的危机密切相关。一方面，中心地区经济增长的减缓导致对原材料和简单工业产品的需求下降，这使得边缘国家的进口替代发展和工业化政策面临更大困难，并使它们面临越来越大的贸易和经常账户赤字。另一方面，由于中心地区加剧的资本运用困难，国际金融市场出现的投机性流动性过剩，为许多边缘国家提供了巨大且基本不受控制的信贷，这使得这些国家能够在一段时间内掩盖其经济困难。由于流入的资金较少用于生产设施的改造和扩建，而更多用于向外国转移利润、补贴中产阶级消费和扩大镇压机构，因此无法消除结构性失衡。 这种债务系统不可避免的崩溃，是由20世纪80年代初，雷根政府在美国实施的新保守主义-货币主义经济政策转变引发的，该政府试图通过巨大的军备计划恢复美国在经济和军事上受到威胁的主导地位。所谓的沃尔克冲击（1979/89），即一场激进的货币紧缩和利率提高，标志着美国启动的新自由主义全球化攻势的开始（Panitch/Gindin 2004a）。其目的是强化财务纪律，阻碍民主的利益政治。这种财务纪律首先影响高度负债的边缘国家。利率上升和美元汇率的大幅上升使它们的利息支付和贷款归还变得完全不可能。这样，始于1970年代在资本主义中心地区的福特主义危机，经过一定时间的延迟，但随后对资本主义边缘国家产生了更加严重的影响（参见Hirsch 1993的更详细论述）。 福特主义的危机不仅有经济和政治原因，而且源于这些发展与意识形态粘合剂瓦解的结合，这种粘合剂曾将这一社会结构团结在一起。以官僚化、规范化和标准化为特征的“安全国家”，建立在标准化商品消费上的富裕，过度的资源浪费和自然破坏以及福特主义 - 通过女性就业增加和小家庭化 - 修改的父权制形式成为日益增长的批评目标，这种批评反映在从1960年代末开始的一种普遍的“价值变革”和形成的“新社会运动”中（参见Hirsch/Roth 1986; Roth 1994）。1970年代中期的“石油危机”虽然绝非世界经济危机的原因，而更多是OPEC和大型石油公司定价策略的结果，但在象征上具有重要意义，明确了自然资源的有限性。经济危机现象，社会福利的瓦解以及曾被认为无限的经济增长的终结，在新的价值取向和抗议运动的背景下，逐渐形成了一种日益扩散的信念，即福特主义的社会模式——其经济结构和它决定的生活条件——不再具有前景。福特主义的危机不仅是资本增值的危机，而且还是与之相关的霸权危机，在所有其维度上都显露无遗：意识形态上通过过去支配性价值观的瓦解，政治上通过美国霸权的侵蚀，以及通过国家和国际组织的转型在制度上受到质疑。"},{"prompt":"请将“Diese hegemoniale Krise, die keineswegs parallel zu den ökonomischen verlief und zweifellos auch nicht einfach nur ökonomisch bedingt war, nahm in den verschiedenen Ländern unterschiedliche Formen an. Die Kräfte und Bewegungen, die sie vorantrieben, waren auch Antriebsmoment für die nun einsetzenden kapitalistischen Restrukturierungsprozesse, obwohl sie durchaus andere Ziele als die Wiederherstellung des Kapitalprofits verfolgt haben mochten. Weder die Krise des Fordismus, noch die seit dem Ende der 1970erJahre einsetzende Restrukturierung des Kapitalismus folgten also dem Plan eines einzelnen gesellschaftlichen Akteurs oder einer einheitlichen Strategie, sondern erwiesen sich als das Ergebnis widersprüchlicher Handlungen und resultierten aus den Zielsetzungen höchst verschiedener Kräfte. Zweifellos spielt das internationalisierte Kapital, das in der Ära des Fordismus stark an Bedeutung gewonnen hatte eine wichtige Rolle bei der Krise des Fordismus und den darauf folgen-den ökonomischen und gesellschaftlichen Restrukturierungsprozessen. Es wäre allerdings zu einfach, in ihm den einzigen strategischen Akteur zu sehen. Festzuhalten bleibt, dass der Akkumulation des Kapitals grundsätzlich die Tendenz innewohnt, die Profitabilität und damit den Bestand und die Entwicklung der kapitalistischen Gesellschaft zu untergraben. Insofern ist die Marxsche Feststellung, im »Gesetz vom tendenziellen Fall der Profitrate« liege die entscheidende Krisendynamik des Kapitalismus, durchaus zutreffend. Dies gilt allerdings nur, sofern man darin nicht einfach einen bloßen ökonomisch-technischen Prozess, sondern eine strukturelle Konstellation der sozialen Kämpfe sieht, der auf Grund der Strategien der beteiligten Akteure sehr unterschiedliche Konsequenzen haben kann (Hirsch 1974, 29ff.). Die Regulationstheorie hat, wie gezeigt, einiges dazu beigetragen, diesen Zusammenhang zu verdeutlichen. Die Krise des For- dismus war eine historisch spezifische Form, in der diese allgemeine Gesetzmäßigkeit zum Ausdruck kam. Das bedeutet, dass eine »Lösung« der Fordismus-Krise - eine radikale, nicht-kapitalistische Alternative stand nicht auf der Tagesordnung - in einer grundlegenden Reorganisation der Kapitalverwertungsbedingungen, was heißt, in der Durchsetzung einer neuen kapitalistischen Gesellschaftsformation bestehen musste. Postfordismus oder Bio- und Infocom-Kapitalismus Ob als Folge der in den 1980er Jahren einsetzenden neoliberalen Deregu- lierungs- und Flexibilisierungspolitik eine historisch neue kapitalistische Formation - Postfordismus genannt - entstanden ist oder die entsprechenden Prozesse nur eine Fortdauer der Fordismuskrise anzeigen, ist in der wissenschaftlichen Debatte umstritten (vgl. Alnasseri u.a. 2001; Hirsch 2001a). Schon der Begriff »Post-Fordismus« macht die Schwierigkeiten deutlich, die gegenwärtig bestehende Phase genau zu charakterisieren. Wenn hier von der Existenz einer spezifischen postfordistischen Formation des Kapitalismus ausgegangen wird, dann geschieht dies unter Berücksichtigung der Tatsache, dass dieser keineswegs eine geschlossene und kohärente Akkumulations-, Regulations- und Hegemonialstruktur aufweist. Davon kann man allerdings bei genauerer Betrachtung auch in Bezug auf den Fordismus kaum sprechen. Ausschlaggebend ist, dass im zurückliegenden Vierteljahrhundert die Akkumulations- und Regulationsbedingungen entscheidenden Veränderungen unterlagen, die zunächst relativ dauerhaft erscheinen und dass der neoliberal transformierte Kapitalismus durchaus den Charakter eines hegemonialen Projekts hat. Nicht nur bestimmen entsprechende Denkweisen die Mediendiskurse und die öffentlichen Debatten, sondern sie schlagen sich auch deutlich im Bewusstsein und Verhalten der Subjekte nieder. Natürlich weist der Postfordis- mus, wie noch zu zeigen sein wird, spezifische Widersprüche und Krisenmomente auf. Dies gilt allerdings für die kapitalistische Gesellschaft grundsätzlich. Die als »Globalisierung« bezeichnete Durchsetzung des Postfordismus war kein naturgesetzlicher oder in einer allgemeinen Logik des Kapitals begründeter Prozess. Zu seinen charakteristischen Antriebskräften gehörten die neoliberal gewendeten Regierungen, die nach dem Scheitern der sozialdemokratischen Reformpolitik in den dominierenden kapitalistischen Staaten an die Macht gekommen waren und vor allem das mächtiger und gegenüber den einzelnen Staaten unabhängiger gewordene multinationale Kapital. Die Interessen dieser Akteure verdichteten sich zu einer Strategie, die unter den durch die Krise des Fordismus veränderten sozialen Kräfteverhältnissen schließlich erfolgreich war. Es ging dabei vor allem darum, die im keynesianisch-fordistischen Staat der Nachkriegszeit institutionalisierten sozialen Kräfteverhältnisse zu zerschlagen und damit die Grundlage für die Umwälzung von Produktionstechnologien und Arbeitsorganisationsformen, einen neuen Schub der Rationalisierung und Freisetzung von Arbeitskräften sowie die Erschließung neuer Anla-gemöglichkeiten für das Kapital zu schaffen. Einen entscheidenden Schub erfuhr diese Entwicklung durch den Zusammenbruch der Sowjetunion und damit des staatssozialistisch organisierten Teils der Welt. Dieser Vorgang war selber ein Ausdruck und eine Folge der Fordismus-Krise. Die gesellschaftlichen und politischen Strukturen der staatssozialistischen Gesellschaften machten es unmöglich, die ökonomischen und technischen Umstrukturierungsprozesse einzuleiten, die notwendig gewesen wären, der sich neu formierenden kapitalistischen Konkurrenz standzuhalten. Deshalb kam es dort zu einer Art Selbsttransformation der Eliten, die daran gingen, ihre Gesellschaften nach kapitalistischen Prinzipien umzuformen. Dies wiederum beschleunigte die postfordistische Transformation sowohl in den Zentren als auch in der Peripherie des Kapitalismus. Die im Gefolge der Fordismus-Krise einsetzende neoliberale Globali- sierungs- und Restrukturierungspolitik kann nicht zuletzt als der erfolgreiche Versuch betrachtet werden, die ökonomische und politische Vorherrschaft der USA - diesmal unter dem Vorzeichen von umfassender ökonomischer Deregulierung und radikaler Marktliberalisierung - wiederherzustellen. Die Liberalisierung der Kapital- und Finanzmärkte hatte dabei eine zentrale Bedeutung. Sie war nicht zuletzt eine bedeutende Voraussetzung für die Finanzierbarkeit immer stärker anwachsender Staatshaushalts- und Außenhandelsdefizite, die zur Grundlage des ökonomischen Wachstums der USA geworden waren. Damit wurde nicht zuletzt ihre militärische Hochrüstung ermöglicht. Insofern hat die Durch-setzung des Postfordismus einen bemerkenswerten geopolitischen und geostrategischen Aspekt (Saxe-Fernandez 1996). Dies darf allerdings nicht in traditionellen nationalstaatlichen Kategorien beurteilt werden. Zwar ging es der Regierung der USA um eine Wiederherstellung ihrer ökonomischen und militärischen Dominanzposition, aber dies war nur möglich, weil dieses Interesse mit dem des international operierenden Kapitals zusammenfiel. Dieses hat in den USA auf Grund der dortigen politischen und gesellschaftlich-ökonomischen Gegebenheiten und nicht zuletzt infolge der militärischen Kräfteverhältnisse einen wichtigen Stütz- und strategischen Bezugspunkt. Die Re-Etablierung der US-Vorherrschaft war somit zugleich eine wesentliche Grundlage für die Wiederherstellung der Profitabilität des Kapitals im Weltmaßstab. Der Kapitalismus war von Anfang an ein globales System. Der Kolo-nialismus gehörte zu seinen entscheidenden Entstehungs- und Entwick-lungsgrundlagen. Das entscheidende Charakteristikum des neuen Akku-mulationsregimes ist deshalb nicht »Globalisierung« an sich, sondern die Durchsetzung einer neuen Form der Internationalisierung der Produktion, die durch die Liberalisierung der Waren-, Finanz- und Kapitalmärkte sowie durch neue Kommunikations- und Transporttechnologien ermöglicht wurde. Das Kapital wurde dadurch in die Lage versetzt, durch die Schaffung globaler Wertschöpfungsketten und mittels einer räumlichen Zerlegung der Unternehmensaktivitäten unterschiedliche sozialräumliche Verwertungsbedingungen flexibler als zuvor auszunutzen. Daraus resultiert eine neue internationale Arbeitsteilung, die die alte, auf Kapitalexport und Warenhandel gegründete, überlagert.”翻译为中文","completion":"这场霸权危机，并不是与经济危机同步发生的，并且毫无疑问不仅仅是经济因素导致的，在不同国家呈现出不同的形态。推动它的力量和运动也是接下来资本主义重组过程的推动力，尽管它们可能追求与恢复资本利润不同的目标。因此，福特主义的危机，以及自1970年代末开始的资本主义重组，并不遵循单一社会行动者或统一战略的计划，而是作为相互矛盾行为的结果，反映了极为不同力量的目标。毫无疑问，在福特主义时代获得重要地位的国际化资本，在福特主义危机及其后的经济和社会重组过程中扮演了重要角色。然而，将其视为唯一的战略行动者则过于简化。 需要指出，资本积累的根本趋势在于削弱利润率，从而破坏资本主义社会的存续和发展。在这一点上，马克思关于“利润率趋势性下降的规律”是资本主义的关键危机动力的陈述是完全正确的。然而，这一说法只在将其视为社会斗争的结构性配置而不仅仅是经济-技术过程的前提下才成立，这种配置因参与行动者的策略而可能产生非常不同的后果（Hirsch 1974, 29ff.）。如上所述，调节理论在阐明这一联系方面作出了贡献。福特主义危机是这一普遍规律特定历史形式的表现。这意味着，“解决”福特主义危机——一个激进的非资本主义替代方案并未出现——必须在基本重组资本增值条件中寻找，也就是说，在实现新的资本主义社会形态中寻找。 后福特主义或生物和信息通讯资本主义 由于20世纪80年代开始的新自由主义放松管制和灵活化政策，是否诞生了一种历史上新的资本主义形态——后福特主义，或这些过程仅仅标志着福特主义危机的延续，在学术辩论中存在争议（参见Alnasseri等人2001; Hirsch 2001a）。即使是“后福特主义”一词本身，也显示出准确界定当前阶段的困难。“后福特主义”形态的资本主义的存在假定是在考虑到这并不表示一个封闭和连贯的积累、调节和霸权结构的前提下的。然而，即使是对福特主义，仔细考虑也很难这么说。决定性的是，在过去的四分之一个世纪中，积累和调节条件经历了根本性的变化，这些变化初看起来相对持久，而新自由主义转型的资本主义确实具有霸权项目的特征。不仅相应的思维方式支配着媒体话语和公共辩论，而且也明显反映在主体的意识和行为中。当然，后福特主义，如将展示，具有特定的矛盾和危机时刻。然而，这对资本主义社会本质上是普遍适用的。 所谓的“全球化”导致后福特主义的实现，并非是一个自然法则或基于资本的一般逻辑的过程。其特征性动力包括经过新自由主义转向的政府，这些政府在主导资本主义国家的社会民主主义改革政策失败后上台，尤其是变得更加强大且相对独立于单个国家的跨国资本。这些行动者的利益凝聚成一种战略，最终在福特主义危机改变的社会力量关系下成功了。其主要目标是打破在战后凯恩斯主义-福特主义国家中制度化的社会力量关系，从而为生产技术和工作组织形式的变革、新的理性化和劳动力释放浪潮以及为资本开辟新的投资机会创造基础。苏联的崩溃以及国家社会主义世界部分的崩溃，为这一发展提供了决定性推动，这一事件本身就是福特主义危机的表达和结果。国家社会主义社会的社会和政治结构使其无法启动必要的经济和技术重组过程，以抵御新兴的资本主义竞争。因此，出现了一种精英自我转型的情况，他们开始按照资本主义原则改造自己的社会。这反过来加速了资本主义中心和边缘的后福特主义转型。 随着福特主义危机而来的新自由主义全球化和重组政策可被视为成功尝试，旨在恢复美国在全面经济放松管制和激进市场自由化旗帜下的经济和政治优势地位。资本和金融市场的自由化在此中起到了核心作用。它不仅是为不断增长的国家预算和贸易赤字提供资金的重要前提，这些赤字已成为美国经济增长的基础。从而使其军事扩张得以实现。因此，后福特主义的实现具有引人注目的地缘政治和地缘战略方面（Saxe-Fernandez 1996）。然而，这决不能以传统的国家主义范畴来评估。尽管美国政府意图恢复其经济和军事主导地位，但这只是因为这一兴趣与国际运营资本的兴趣相一致。正是在美国的政治、社会经济情况下，尤其是由于军事力量关系，跨国资本找到了重要的支撑和战略参考点。因此，美国主导地位的重新确立也成为全球范围内恢复资本盈利能力的基础。 资本主义从一开始就是一个全球系统。殖民主义是其决定性的成立和发展基础之一。新积累体制的决定性特征因此不是“全球化”本身，而是通过商品、金融和资本市场的自由化以及新的通讯和运输技术的实现，推动生产的国际化的新形式。资本因此能够通过创建全球价值链和通过对公司活动的空间分解更灵活地利用不同的社会地理价值提取条件。这导致了新的国际分工，它覆盖了基于资本输出和商品贸易的旧有模式。"},{"prompt":"请将“Die Tatsache, dass heute etwa ein Drittel des statistisch gemessenen internationalen Warenhandels aus konzerninternen Lieferungen multi-nationaler Unternehmungen besteht, verweist darauf, dass tatsächlich eine globale, nationale Grenzen überschreitende Ökonomie entstanden ist. Multinationale Konzerne können Teile ihrer Unternehmensaktivitäten an die Orte der Welt verlagern, die sich von den Lohnkosten, den Arbeits-kraftqualifikationen, den Umweltstandards oder den politischen Macht-verhältnissen am jeweils günstigsten erweisen. Diese neue Beweglichkeit des Kapitals eröffnet nicht nur erhebliche Rationalisierungsspielräume, sondern vergrößert auch die Möglichkeit, Lohnabhängige und Gewerkschaften gegeneinander auszuspielen. Mit der Entwicklung transnationaler Unternehmensnetzwerke verloren nationalstaatlich umgrenzte ökonomische Reproduktionszusammenhänge - die für den Fordismus typischen »Nationalökonomien - ihre relative Geschlossenheit. Das bedeutet allerdings nicht, dass die einzelnen Staaten als politische Institutionalisierungsformen von Klassenverhältnissen bedeutungslos geworden wären. Das internationale Kapital begann nur, sich in ganz anderer Form und auf höchst flexible Weise darauf zu beziehen (Ohmae 1985, 1992; Lipietz 1987, 26). Dabei wurde die Ausnutzung der - legalen wie illegalen - Arbeitskraftmigration über die nach wie vor existierenden nationalen Grenzen hinweg zu einer immer bedeutsameren Grundlage des Kapitalverwertungsprozesses. Dadurch kam es zu einer neuartigen Form der Hierarchisierung der ökonomischen Räume. Regionale ökonomische Zusammenhänge innerhalb nationalstaatlicher Grenzen und über diese hinweg verdichteten sich. Ökonomischsoziale Ungleichheiten auf nationaler wie internationaler Ebene werden dadurch nicht aufgehoben, sondern eher noch vertieft. Diese ungleiche Entwicklung ist fundamental für den globalen Akkumulationsprozess. Sie kulminiert in der absoluten ökonomischen, politischen und militärischen Dominanz der gleichzeitig untereinander konkurrierenden Triadezentren - Nordamerika, Europa und Japan - über die kapitalistische Peripherie. Der Postfordismus ist durch veränderte Formen des Lohnverhältnisses und der Arbeitsorganisation, einen hochgradig finanzgetriebenen Akkumulationsmodus (Aglietta 2000), damit verbunden veränderten Geld- und Konkurrenzbeziehungen sowie durch eine neuartige Bedeutung von Natur und Wissen im ökonomischen Reproduktionsprozess gekennzeichnet. Diese beinhaltet zugleich einen vertieften Schub der Kommodifizierung und Durchkapitalisierung der gesellschaftlichen Beziehungen. Betrachten wir kurz die wichtigsten Merkmale des postfordistischen Akkumulationsregimes: 1. Die Lohn- und Arbeitsverhältnisse werden von starken Tendenzen der Entformalisierung und Prekarisierung geprägt und differenzieren sich in erheblichem Umfang aus. (Schein-)Selbständigkeit sowie neue Formen der Subsistenzproduktion gewinnen an Bedeutung. Die sozialen Siche-rungssysteme werden eingeschränkt und teilweise privatisiert. Die Ge-werkschaften sind geschwächt und zentrale Tarifvertragsregelungen erodieren. Dadurch entkoppelt sich der für den Fordismus typische Zusammenhang von tayloristischer Massenproduktion und dem auf normierter Lohnarbeit sowie sozialstaatlichen Sicherungen beruhenden Massenkonsum. Diese Tendenz kommt sowohl in den Metropolen als auch in der Peripherie - wenn auch in unterschiedlichen Formen und Ausmaßen - zur Geltung. Die Folge ist, dass gesellschaftliche Spaltungen und Un-gleichheiten allgemein zunehmen. 2. Die veränderten sozialen Kräfteverhältnisse schlagen sich in einer tendenziellen Stagnation oder sogar Rückläufigkeit der realen Masseneinkommen nieder. Der fordistische Zusammenhang von Wachstum und Konsumsteigerung ist zerbrochen. Daher zeigt der Postfordismus deutliche Überproduktionserscheinungen. Die Überakkumulationskrise äußert sich nunmehr aber nicht in der Form einer Stagflation, sondern zieht eher deflationäre Tendenzen nach sich. 3. Ein besonders wichtiges Merkmal des Postfordismus ist die »Finan- zialisierung« der ökonomischen Verhältnisse im Zuge der Deregulierung der Kapital- und Finanzmärkte. Dies unterwirft nicht nur die einzelnen Regierungen einer politisch nur noch schwer beeinflussbaren finanziellen Disziplin, sondern führt in Verbindung mit der weiter voranschreitenden Internationalisierung des Kapitals dazu, dass finanzkapitalistische Kalküle, d.h. Profiterzielung mittels - oft kurzfristiger und spekulativer - Finanzanlagen für den ökonomischen Prozess bestimmender werden. Folgen davon sind eine Häufung spekulativer Krisen und kapitalvernichtender Unternehmenszusammenbrüche. Ein Beispiel dafür ist der Kollaps der so genannten New Economy. Allerdings muss dabei berücksichtigt werden, dass finanzielle Instabilitäten und die daraus folgenden ökonomischen Zwänge eine zentrale Rolle bei der Umwälzung wirtschaftlicher und gesellschaftlicher Beziehungen haben. Sie sind daher ein durchaus funktionaler Bestandteil der postfordistischen Restrukturierung (Rüde 2004). Die Finanzialisierung treibt die Veränderung der Lohn- und Arbeitsverhältnisse sowie der unternehmerischen Organisationsstrukturen voran. Die kurzfristige Profitorientierung der Unternehmenspolitik (»Shareholder-Kapitalismus«) blendet die langfristigen Bedingungen der Kapitalverwertung wie Infrastrukturausbau, politische und soziale Stabilität tendenziell aus. Maßgebend dafür ist auch, dass sich die beherr- sehenden internationalen Konzerne von einzelstaatlichen Sozial- und Wirtschaftsbeziehungen stark abgekoppelt haben und an deren Entwicklung weniger interessiert sind. Besonders bedeutungsvoll ist, dass die Fi- nanzialisierung der postfordistischen Ökonomie erhebliche Verschiebungen in der Struktur des kapitalistischen Machtblocks nach sich gezogen hat. Das »Finanzkapital« in Form von Banken, Investment- und spekulativen Hedgefonds hat an Bedeutung gewonnen, wodurch sich zugleich - z.B. in Form einer vergrößerten Abhängigkeit der Unternehmensmanagements von Kapitalsammei- und -Verwaltungsorganisationen - auch die Eigentums- und Direktionsbeziehungen verändert haben. 4. Das postfordistische Geldverhältnis ist dadurch geprägt, dass infolge der Deregulierung der Geld- und Kapitalmärkte der fordistische Modus nationalstaatlicher Geldregulierung faktisch ausgehebelt worden ist. Die Freisetzung des Geld- und Kapitalverkehrs von einzelstaatlichen politischen Kontrollen erweitert den Operationsspielraum der Unternehmen beträchtlich und ist Basis für die Internationalisierung der Produktion und der sie begleitenden Kapitalbewegungen. Allerdings ist der Begriff der »Freisetzung« insofern zu relativieren, als sich dieser zwar auf die Möglichkeit demokratischer politischer Kontrollen, nicht aber auf die Rolle des Staates allgemein bezieht. Nicht nur wurde die Deregulierung des Geld- und Kapitalverkehrs staatlich durchgesetzt, sondern die Zentralbanken und Finanzministerien der dominierenden Metropolen sowie die von diesen kontrollierten internationalen Organisationen (IWF, Weltbank) beeinflussen immer noch erheblich die Entwicklung der internationalen Finanzmärkte. Allerdings vergrößert sich dadurch die Abhängigkeit insbesondere peripherer Staaten noch weiter.”翻译为中文","completion":"如今约有三分之一的统计上的国际货物贸易来自跨国公司的内部交付，这表明实际上已经形成了一种跨越国家边界的全球经济。跨国公司能够将其业务活动转移到世界上从工资成本、劳动力素质、环境标准或政治权力关系上最为有利的地方。这种资本的新流动性不仅开辟了大量的合理化空间，而且还增加了对抗雇员和工会的能力。 随着跨国企业网络的发展，国家范围内的经济再生产环境——对福特主义典型的“国民经济”失去了其相对的封闭性。然而，这并不意味着各国作为阶级关系的政治制度化形式变得无关紧要。国际资本只是开始以一种全然不同且极为灵活的方式与之关联（Ohmae 1985, 1992; Lipietz 1987, 26）。其中，利用横跨现存国家边界的法定及非法劳动力迁移成为资本增值过程的一个越来越重要的基础。这导致了经济空间的新型等级化。国家内部和跨越国家边界的区域经济联系变得更加密集。国家内部和国际层面上的经济社会不平等因此不是被消除，而是被进一步加深。这种不平等的发展是全球积累过程的根本。它在北美洲、欧洲和日本这几个互相竞争的三足鼎立中心的绝对经济、政治和军事统治下达到了顶点，超越了资本主义边缘地区。 后福特主义的特点是工资和劳动组织形式的变化、高度金融驱动的积累模式（Aglietta 2000）、相关的货币和竞争关系的变化，以及自然和知识在经济再生产过程中的新意义。这同时也意味着社会关系的商品化和资本化进一步加深。 让我们简要回顾后福特主义积累制度的主要特征： 1. 工资和劳动关系受到去正式化和不稳定化强烈趋势的影响，并在很大程度上呈现出分化。似乎是自营和新形式的基本生存生产变得更为重要。社会保障系统受到限制甚至部分私有化。工会势力减弱，集体劳动协议的中央规定遭到侵蚀。因此，典型的福特主义中泰勒主义的大规模生产与基于规范化工资劳动以及社会福利保障的大众消费之间的联系被切断。这种趋势无论是在中心国家还是边缘地区——尽管形式和程度不同——都有体现。结果是，社会分裂和不平等普遍增加。 2. 改变的社会力量关系反映在实际大众收入的趋势性停滞或甚至下降。福特主义时代增长和消费提升之间的关系已经破裂。因此，后福特主义明显表现为过剩生产。过度积累危机如今不再以滞胀的形式表现，而更可能引发通货紧缩趋势。 3. 后福特主义一个特别重要的特征是在资本和金融市场放松管制的过程中经济关系的“金融化”。这不仅使各国政府受到难以政治控制的金融纪律的约束，而且连同资本的进一步国际化，导致金融资本计算——即通过常常是短期和投机性的金融投资获得利润——对经济过程变得更为决定性。其结果是投机性危机和资本毁灭性的企业崩溃的增加，例如所谓的新经济的崩溃便是一个例子。然而，需要考虑到，金融不稳定性及其引发的经济压力在经济和社会关系的大转换中发挥了核心作用。因此，它们是后福特主义重组的一个完全功能性组成部分（Rüde 2004）。金融化推动了工资和劳动关系及企业组织结构的变革。“股东资本主义”下的企业政策短期利润导向，趋向忽视资本增值的长期条件如基础设施建设、政治和社会稳定。主要由于，主导的国际公司已大大脱离单一国家的社会和经济关系，对其发展的兴趣减少。特别重要的是，后福特主义经济的金融化在资本主义权力集团的结构中引发了重大变化。形式为银行、投资和投机性对冲基金的“金融资本”变得更加重要，从而，例如，通过增加公司管理层对资金收集和管理组织的依赖，也改变了所有权和管理关系。 4. 后福特主义的货币关系特征在于，由于货币和资本市场的放松管制，事实上使福特主义时期国家货币调节模式实际上被取消。货币和资本流通的放开超越了单一国家的政治控制，极大地扩展了公司的运营空间，并为生产的国际化及其伴随的资本流动奠定了基础。然而，“放开”的概念在某种程度上需要相对化，因为它虽然指的是民主政治控制的可能性，但并不涉及国家的一般角色。放松货币和资本流动的管制不仅是由国家实施的，而且主导大都会以及由它们控制的国际组织（如国际货币基金组织、世界银行）仍然对国际金融市场的发展有着重大影响。然而，这进一步加大了特别是边缘国家的依赖。"},{"prompt":"请将“5.

Eine Folge davon ist die Verstärkung des Innovations-, Rationalisierungs- und Umstrukturierungsdrucks. Im Vergleich zum Fordismus kann somit vom Übergang zu einer neuen Phase der Konkurrenzregulation gesprochen werden, die allerdings oligopolistisch strukturiert ist und sich hauptsächlich auf der Ebene des Weltmarkts abspielt. 6. Wie jede neue kapitalistische Formation ist auch der Postfordismus durch die Erschließung neuer gesellschaftlicher Sphären für die Kapitalverwertung charakterisiert. Dies bezieht sich nicht nur darauf, dass mit dem Zusammenbruch des Staatssozialismus nun praktisch die ganze Welt dem Kapital offen steht oder gegebenenfalls mittels militärischer Interventionen geöffnet werden kann, sondern sie beinhaltet zugleich einen neuen Schub der »inneren Landnahme«. Betraf diese im Fordismus noch die materielle Reproduktion der Arbeitskraft in Form industriell gefertigter Massenkonsumgüter, so richtet sie sich nun auf den so genannten Dienstleistungssektor, der durch die neuen Informations- und Kommu-nikationstechnologien starken Rationalisierungsprozessen unterworfen und zugleich im Zuge umfassender Privatisierungsmaßnahmen breitflächig kommerzialisiert wird. Von besonderer Bedeutung sind die neuen Formen der Einbeziehung von Natur und Wissen in den Verwertungsprozess. Die schrankenlose Ausbeutung und Zerstörung von natürlichen Ressourcen bildete nicht nur Grundlage, sondern auch Schranke und Krisenmoment des Fordismus. Nun wird deren kapitalistische Bewirtschaftung und Erhaltung zu einem bedeutendem Bestandteil des neuen Akkumulationsregimes. Dies geschieht nicht mehr nur durch staatliche Auflagen und Beschränkungen, sondern immer stärker durch die Kom- modifizierung und Inwertsetzung von bisher frei verfügbaren Ressourcen als marktgängige Waren. Beispiele sind der Handel mit Emissionszertifikaten oder die Überführung ehemals frei verfügbarer Ressourcen in privates Eigentum, z.B. bei der Privatisierung der Wasserversorgung oder Patentierung von genetischem Material (Brand/Görg 2003). Mit diesem Kommodifizierungsschub entsteht ein »ökologischer Kapitalismus« und ein »Wissenskapitalismus«, der das Management von Naturressourcen und die Aneignung »intellektuellen Eigentums« zu einem zentralen Gegenstand unternehmerischer Verwertungsstrategien macht und damit die Herrschaft über Mensch und Natur auf eine neue Stufe hebt (Hirsch 2002b). Der fordistisch-tayloristische Arbeitsprozess war grundsätzlich durch eine Trennung der lebendigen Arbeit vom Produktionswissen und dessen Inkorporierung in das Maschinensystem gekennzeichnet. Im Post- fordismus verändert sich demgegenüber die Bedeutung gesellschaftlichen Wissens grundlegend. Es nimmt die Gestalt eigenständiger, relativ unabhängig von der konkreten Maschinerie verfüg- und verwertbaren Waren - z.B. in Form von Softwareprogrammen - an (Gorz 2004). Diese werden in hoch arbeitsteiligen Expertensystemen erzeugt, was einen weiteren Schub der kapitalistischen Vergesellschaftung der Produktivkräfte markiert. Zugleich wird Wissen als Grundlage »technologischer Renten« zu einem noch entscheidenderen Faktor in der Konkurrenz, die immer stärker durch die exklusive Verfügung über »geistige Eigentumsrechte« bestimmt wird. Man kann darin in der Tat ein Schlüsselelement der neuen Akkumulations- und Regulationsweise sehen (Rifkin 2000). Diese Veränderungen berühren auch die Bedeutung der Arbeitskraft-qualifikation im kapitalistischen Verwertungsprozess. In einigen techno-logischen Kernsektoren kommt es zu einer Re-Qualifizierung der Arbeitskraft, die mit fortbestehenden Tendenzen zur Entqualifizierung in den standardisierten Bereichen von Produktion und Dienstleistung sowie in den ökonomisch marginalisierten Sektoren einhergeht. Damit vergrößert sich die Heterogenisierung und Spaltung der Lohnabhängigen. Insgesamt beinhaltet die vergrößerte Bedeutung des »Humankapitals« in den technologischen Kernsektoren ein qualitativ neues Stadium der Subsumtion der Arbeitskraft unter das Kapitalverhältnis, die in vielen Bereichen die Gestalt komplexer Mensch-Maschinensysteme annimmt. Das Kapital benutzt die Arbeitskraft immer weniger nur im Sinne der Nutzung technischer Kompetenzen, sondern beansprucht die Menschen total, mit ihren manuellen wie mit ihren physisch-geistigen Fähigkeiten - Kreativität, Innovations-, Anpassungs- und Kooperationsfähigkeit (Ne- gri/Lazzarato/Virno 1998, 17ff., 41 ff.; Bröckling u.a. 2000; Gorz 2004). In der Figur des »Arbeitskraft-Unternehmers« gewinnt dieses Verhältnis seine aktuelle Gestalt. 7. Die gesamte Entwicklung beinhaltet damit einen neuen Schub der Durchkapitalisierung der Gesellschaft in Form der direkten Unterwerfung weiterer gesellschaftlicher Sphären und der gesellschaftlichen Subjekte unter den Kapitalverwertungsprozess. Dabei spielen die postfordi- stischen Schlüsselindustrien der Kommunikations- und Informationstechnik sowie der so genannten Life Industries (Bio- und Gentechnik) eine zentrale Rolle. Man kann den Postfordismus daher auch als Bio- und In- fokom-Kapitalismus bezeichnen. Das besondere Kennzeichen dieser Industrien liegt darin, dass sie in besonderem Maß wissensbasiert sind, was der Arbeitskraftqualifikation und der Produktion und Aneignung von Wissen eine Schlüsselstellung zuweist. Ihr verwertungsstrategischer Stellenwert liegt darin, dass sie die Grundlage neuer systemischer Rationalisierungsprozesse insbesondere im Bereich der immateriellen Arbeit (Forschung, Entwicklung, Produktionsvorbereitung und -steuerung, Dienstleistungen) darstellen, eines Bereichs also, der für den tayloristischen Rationalisierungsmodus nur beschränkt zugänglich war. Gleichzeitig eröffnen sie dem Kapital neue Anlage- und Verwertungssphären, so etwa im Dienstleistungs-, Informations- und Telekommunikationsbereich, der Agrarproduktion und in der Gesundheitsindustrie - den »Life Industries« eben. Nicht zuletzt der Abbau staatlicher Sicherungs- und Versorgungs-systeme erschließt dem Kapital - von Pensionsfonds über Versicherungen bis hin zu privaten Pflege- und Versorgungsdiensten - weite Felder. Insgesamt verbindet also das postfordistische Akkumulationsregime eine Vergrößerung der Ausbeutungsrate (Lohnsenkung, Rationalisierung, Arbeitsintensivierung) mit einem neuen Schub der »inneren Landnahme« durch Unterwerfung weiterer gesellschaftlicher Bereiche - nicht zuletzt in erweiterten Dimensionen von Psyche und Körper - unter den kapitalistischen Verwertungsprozess. 8. Die Durchsetzung des neuen Akkumulationsregimes ist schließlich von einer bedeutsamen Veränderung des Raum-Zeit-Verhältnisses begleitet. Jede historische Form des Kapitalismus hat ihre spezifischen raumzeitlichen Koordinaten (Alnasseri u.a. 2001). Der Fordismus war durch eine starke Homogenisierung von Raum und Zeit im nationalstaatlichen Rahmen gekennzeichnet. Der Postfordismus ist - auf der Grundlage neuer Informations- und Kommunikationstechnologien - durch einen komplexen Prozess der Komprimierung und Dehnung der Raum-Zeit-Dimensionen gekennzeichnet (Jessop 2001a). Entfernungen schrumpfen zusammen und regionale Zeitzonen werden relativiert. Die Beschleunigung von Informationen in globalen Netzwerken führt zu neuen raum-zeitlichen Hierarchien. Ökonomische, politische und sozio-kulturelle Sphären entwickeln sich quer zu einzelstaatlichen Grenzen. Es entstehen ökonomische Ballungszentren, die untereinander in engerer Verbindung stehen als mit ihrer unmittelbarer Umgebung. Die geographischen Unterschiede zwischen »erster« und »dritter« Welt verfließen. Eine räumliche Dezentralisierung produktiver und administrativer Tätigkeiten im Kontext globaler Unternehmensnetzwerke verbindet sich mit einer Zentralisierung von Steuerungs- und Kontrollfunktionen. In diesem Zusammenhang kommt den sich über einzelstaatliche Grenzen hinweg verflechtenden »Global Cities« eine besondere Bedeutung zu. Grenzüberschreitende Kapital- und Migrationsströme führen tendenziell zu einer »Entnationalisierung« des raum-zeitlichen Koordinatensystems (Zürn 1998; Albert 1998; Jessop 1997; Jessop 2001b; Sassen 1996, 2003). Damit erhält die Frage der Zugehörigkeit zu ökonomischen und politischen Räumen eine erhöhte Brisanz. Der Globalisierungsprozess führt nicht zum Verschwinden der Grenzen, sondern diese werden neu definiert und konfiguriert.”翻译为中文","completion":"5. 福特主义资本主义的竞争关系以垄断性组织形式的主导为特点——包括企业集团、中央集权的企业协会和工会、公司化的谈判结构，以及广泛的国家干预主义和保护主义，部分还有重要的国有企业部门。相比之下，后福特主义积累制度以劳动力的强烈异质化和分散化、增强的劳动移民、结构性大规模失业、尤其在企业层面增长的去中心化的企业结构的重要性、以及工会和企业协会的显著削弱为特征。此外还有对以前国有企业部门的广泛私有化。相对于主要面向国内市场的企业集团，专注于特定技术和市场细分的、国际网络化的“全球玩家”变得更为重要。总的来说，新自由主义的放松管制政策首先导致了企业间竞争的加剧。由此产生的是创新、合理化和重组压力的加强。与福特主义相比，可以说是进入了竞争调节的新阶段，尽管它是由寡头垄断结构定义的，并且主要在世界市场上发生。 6. 与每一新的资本主义形态一样，后福特主义也以开拓新的社会领域以实现资本增值为特征。这不仅指随着国家社会主义的崩溃，几乎整个世界都对资本开放，或者必要时可以通过军事干预打开，而且同时涉及到一轮新的“内部土地掠夺”。在福特主义中，这种内部土地掠夺还涉及到工业生产的大众消费品形式的劳动力物质再生产，现在则转向所谓的服务业，该行业受到新信息和通信技术的强烈合理化影响，同时随着全面的私有化措施而被广泛商业化。自然和知识被纳入增值过程的新形式尤为重要。无限制的自然资源开发和破坏不仅构成了福特主义的基础，而且也构成了其局限和危机因素。现在，它们的资本主义式经营和保护成为新的积累制度的一个重要组成部分。不再仅仅通过国家规定和限制，而是通过将以前自由获取的资源商品化和货币化为市场商品而实现。例如，排放权交易或将以前免费资源私有化，如水资源私有化或基因材料专利化（Brand/Görg 2003）。随着这一商品化激增，形成了“生态资本主义”和“知识资本主义”，将自然资源管理和“知识产权”征用变成了企业增值战略的核心内容，从而将对人与自然的统治提升到了一个新的水平（Hirsch 2002b）。 福特主义-泰勒主义的工作过程基本上通过活生生的劳动与生产知识分离，将其纳入机器系统来特征化。相比之下，在后福特主义中，社会知识的重要性发生了根本改变。它采取了独立的、相对独立于具体机械设备的、可用和可增值的商品形式——例如，以软件程序的形式（Gorz 2004）。这些在高度分工的专家系统中产生，标志着资本主义社会生产力的又一轮资本主义化。知识作为“技术租金”的基础成为竞争中的决定性因素，越来越多地通过对“知识产权”的独家控制来确定。事实上，这可以视为新的积累和调节方式的关键元素（Rifkin 2000）。 这些变化也触及了劳动力资格在资本主义增值过程中的重要性。在某些技术核心部门，劳动力的再培训伴随着标准化的生产和服务领域以及经济边缘化部门持续的去技能化趋势。这加剧了劳动力的异质化和分裂。总的来说，“人力资本”在技术核心部门中的增加意义预示着资本关系下劳动力被征用的一个全新阶段，这在许多领域采取了复杂的人机系统形式。资本越来越少地仅利用劳动力的技术技能，而是全面索取人们的各方面能力——手工技能以及体力和智力能力——创造力、创新力、适应力和合作能力（Negri/Lazzarato/Virno 1998, 17ff., 41ff.; Bröckling等人2000; Gorz 2004）。在“劳动力企业家”这一概念中，这种关系具体化。 这整个发展意味着社会进一步资本化的新浪潮，以直接将更多社会领域和社会主体纳入资本增值过程的形式出现。通信和信息技术以及所谓的生命产业（生物技术和基因技术）这些后福特主义的关键产业在此中发挥中心作用。因此，后福特主义也可以称为生物和信息通信资本主义。这些产业的特殊之处在于它们在很大程度上是基于知识的，这赋予了劳动力资格和知识的生产和征用以关键地位。它们的增值战略价值在于它们构成了新的系统合理化过程的基础，特别是在非物质劳动领域（研究、开发、生产准备和控制、服务），这是泰勒主义合理化模式所难以触及的。同时，它们为资本开拓了新的投资和增值领域，例如在服务、信息和电信、农业生产和健康产业——即“生命产业”。国家保障和福利体系的削减为资本——从养老基金到保险再到私人护理和供应服务——开辟了广阔领域。总的来说，后福特主义积累制度通过增加剥削率（降低工资、合理化、加强工作强度）与通过将更多社会领域——尤其是精神和身体的扩展维度——纳入资本主义增值过程的新内部土地掠夺浪潮相结合。 这一新积累制度的实施最终伴随着空间-时间关系的显著变化。每一种历史形式的资本主义都有其特定的空间-时间坐标（Alnasseri等人2001）。福特主义以国家范围内空间和时间的强烈同化为特点。后福特主义则基于新的信息和通讯技术，通过空间-时间尺度的复杂压缩和扩张过程来特征化（Jessop 2001a）。距离的缩短和区域时区的相对化。在全球网络中信息的加速传播导致了新的空间-时间等级。经济、政治和社会文化领域跨越国家边界发展。经济聚集中心之间的联系比与其周边更为紧密。\\"第一世界\\"和\\"第三世界\\"之间的地理差异变得模糊。在全球企业网络背景下生产和行政活动的地理去中心化与管理和控制功能的中心化相结合。在这一背景下，跨越国家边界相互交织的\\"全球城市\\"具有特殊意义。跨国资本和移民流动趋向于\\"去国家化\\"空间-时间坐标系（Zürn 1998; Albert 1998; Jessop 1997; Jessop 2001b; Sassen 1996, 2003）。因此，与经济和政治空间的归属问题变得更加紧迫。全球化进程并未导致边界的消失，而是导致边界被重新定义和配置。"},{"prompt":"请将“Der beschleunigte Zeitrhythmus der online verbundenen Metropolen-zentren kontrastiert immer stärker mit dem peripherer ökonomischer und sozialer Regionen. Während das Finanzkapital in immer kürzeren Zeiträumen zirkuliert und in gewissem Sinne ortlos wird, nimmt gerade durch die technologische Entwicklung die Abhängigkeit produktiver Investitionen von spezifischen gesellschaftlichen, kulturellen und infrastrukturellen Milieubedingungen eher zu. Diese sind in spezifischer Weise ortsgebunden und entwickeln sich in ganz anderen Zeitdimensionen (Jessop 2000). Die Regulation komplexer Raum-Zeit-Verhältnisse wird dadurch zu einem immer wichtigeren Problem. Bedeutsam dabei ist, dass der postfordistische Restrukturierungsprozess keinesfalls als eine einfache »Freisetzung« (»disembedding«) ökonomischer Prozesse und als schrankenlose Entfesselung der Marktkräfte verstanden werden kann. Dies ist eher eine neoliberale Propagandaformel denn gesellschaftliche Realität. Die mit »Globalisierung« bezeichnete Entwicklung hat zweifellos im internationalisierten Kapital einen wesentlichen Akteur, wurde aber durch die Politik von Staaten und Regierungen vorangetrieben. Was üblicherweise als »Deregulierung« genannt wird, vollzieht sich deshalb von Beginn an im Kontext einer veränderten politischen Regulierung. Der Freisetzungs-These liegt eine falsche Entgegensetzung von »Staat« und »Markt« zugrunde, die unberücksichtigt lässt, dass Marktprozesse immer politisch »eingebettet« sind und der Staat keine »außerökonomische« Instanz, sondern selbst ein integraler Bestandteil des kapitalistischen Produktionsverhältnisses ist. Entgegen der verbreiteten Annahme einer »Erosion« bzw. eines Bedeutungsverlusts der Staaten bleiben diese - als der Rahmen, in dem das kapitalistische Klassenverhältnis organisiert und der gesellschaftliche Zusammenhalt gewährleistet wird - nach wie vor wichtige institutionelle Zentren der Regulation. Sie verändern allerdings ihre Struktur, ihre Funktionen und ihren Charakter. Die Frage nach der Existenz einer postfordistischen Regulationsweise kann sich daher nicht daran festmachen, ob es zu einer Re-Regulierung von Gesellschaft und Ökonomie praktisch nach fordistischem Muster kommt. Vielmehr geht es darum, ob sich die bestehenden Regulierungsformen zu einem relativ stabilen und beständigen - dabei natürlich widersprüchlichen und konflikthaften - System verbinden. Dies scheint der Fall zu sein. Mit dem postfordistischen Akkumulationsregime hat sich eine Regulationsweise herausgebildet, die sich von der des Fordismus in zentralen Punkten unterscheidet. Sie stellt kein konsistentes »Projekt« dar, sondern entsteht in einem widersprüchlichen und konfliktorischen Prozess, der unabgeschlossen und umkämpft ist. Maßgebend dafür sind die durch die Krise der fordistischen Formation und die neoliberalen Restrukturierungs-strategien veränderten internationalen Dominanzstrukturen und gesellschaftlichen Kräfteverhältnisse, die neuen kapitalistischen Verwertungsstrategien und die damit verbundenen Verschiebungen der sozialen Konfliktachsen. Die postfordistische Regulationsweise weist folgende wesentliche Merkmale auf: • eine neue internationale Machtstruktur, die durch ein komplexes Ko- operations- und Konfliktverhältnis zwischen den Metropolenstaaten der »Triade« unter der Dominanz der USA bei klarer Unterordnung der Peripherie und Semiperipherie gekennzeichnet ist; • eine neue Form der Konkurrenzregulation anstelle der staatsinterven-tionistisch-monopolistischen des Fordismus, die sich mit der Durchkapitalisierung weiterer gesellschaftlicher Sphären und damit der Kom- modifizierung insbesondere von Natur und Wissen verbindet; • eine im Verhältnis zu der auf den nationalstaatlichen Raum konzen trierten fordistischen Regulationsweise starke räumliche Differenzierung und Internationalisierung der Regulierungssysteme; • und schließlich eine erhebliche Transformation und Internationalisierung des »erweiterten Staats« durch die Ausbreitung staatlich-privater Netzwerke und public-private-partnerships nicht nur auf nationaler, sondern auch auf internationaler Ebene. Mit der Transformation des Staates und des Staatensystems beschäftigen wir uns im folgenden Kapitel. 3. Die Transformation der Staaten und des Staatensystems Der in den 1970er Jahren einsetzenden Prozess der neoliberalen Restrukturierung brachte eine tiefgreifende Veränderung der Rolle, die die Staaten und das Staatensystem bei der Regulation ökonomisch-sozialer Prozesse und der diesen zugrunde liegenden sozialen Konflikte und Klassenverhältnisse spielen. Der Typus des fordistischen, auf einen relativ abgegrenzten ökonomischen Raum bezogenen und gesellschaftlich integrierenden Staates, in dessen Rahmen zumindest im kapitalistischen Nordwesten des Globus und innerhalb der Schranken der herrschenden Produktionsverhältnisse eine materiell abgestützte demokratische Entwicklung möglich geworden war, ist dadurch beseitigt worden. Der herkömmliche Nationalstaat ist in der Tat zu einem Auslaufmodell geworden und damit steht auch die Zukunft der liberalen Demokratie zur Disposition. Die neoliberale Restrukturierung hatte im Kern eine Reorganisation der staatsförmig institutionalisierten Klassenbeziehungen und damit eine strukturelle Umwälzung der gesellschaftlichen Kräfteverhältnisse zugunsten des Kapitals zum Ziel. Damit wurde die Durchsetzung eines neuen Rationalisierungsschubs und die Erschließung weiterer Kapitalanlagesphären möglich. Sie hat die Internationalisierung der Produktion und die Schaffung grenzüberschreitender Unternehmensnetzwerke erheblich beschleunigt. Das Kapital konnte sich damit aus seiner Abhängigkeit von nationalen Märkten und von den auf einzelstaatlicher Ebene institutionalisierten Klassenkompromissen weiter lösen. Die Folgen für die Struktur des Staatensystems waren einschneidend. Die staatliche »Steuerungsfähigkeit« vor allem auf wirtschafts- und sozialpolitischem Gebiet wurde stark beschränkt, zunehmende internationale ökonomische Verflechtungen ließen die ehemals relativ geschlossenen Nationalökonomien aufbrechen und die gesellschaftlichen Fragmentierungen nahmen zu. Die multinationalen Unternehmungen stehen den Staaten als mächtige Akteure mit erheblich erweiterten Aktionsspielräumen gegenüber. Die Deregulierung der Kapital- und Finanzmärkte intensivierte, verbunden mit der Internationalisierung der Produktion, die Konkurrenz der Standorte. Nicht nur für Staaten, sondern auch für Regionen und Kommunen gewann dadurch die Herstellung günstiger Verwertungsbedingungen für das mobiler gewordene Kapital politische Priorität. Angesichts der im Zuge der neoliberalen Deregulierungs- und Privatisierungspolitik systematisch beschnittenen wirtschafts- und sozialpoliti- sehen Spielräume der Staaten wurde schon früh von einem Verlust staatlicher »Souveränität« gesprochen (Held 1991; Cartilleri/Falk 1992). Dies ist allerdings in mehrfacher Hinsicht zu relativieren. Staaten sind, als Bestandteil des Kapitalverhältnisses und als Ausdruck sozialer Klassen- und Kräfteverhältnisse, immer von diesen bestimmt. Bereits deshalb sind sie höchstens in einem juristischen Sinne souverän. Vor allem aber ist zu beachten, dass es staatliche Politiken waren, die den neoliberalen Transformationsprozess in Gang gesetzt haben und in Gang halten. Bei der neoliberalen Globalisierung handelt sich eher um eine Art Selbsttransformation der Staaten zwecks Reorganisation der in ihnen institutionalisierten Klassenbeziehungen, die wiederum durch die in der Krise des Fordismus veränderten sozialen Kräfteverhältnissen vorangetrieben wurde. Damit verbunden ist das Auseinanderbrechen der hegemonialen Blöcke, die im Zeichen der Systemkonkurrenz und des Kalten Kriegs dem fordistischen Staatensystem eine gewisse Stabilität verliehen hatten.”翻译为中文","completion":"在线联接的大都会中心地区的加速时间节奏与边缘的经济和社会地区形成了日益强烈的对比。虽然金融资本在越来越短的时间内流通，某种意义上变得无地域性，但正是由于技术发展，生产性投资对特定的社会、文化和基础设施环境条件的依赖反而增加。这些环境条件以特定的方式与地域绑定，并在完全不同的时间尺度上发展（Jessop 2000）。因此，复杂的时空关系的调节变得越来越重要。 重要的是，后福特主义重组过程绝不能简单地理解为经济过程的“脱嵌”和市场力量的无限解放。这在更大程度上是新自由主义宣传口号而非社会现实。“全球化”这一术语无疑指国际化资本是一个关键参与者，但这一过程是由国家和政府的政策推动的。“放松管制”因此从一开始就处于改变了政治调节的背景下进行。\\"解放\\"论忽视了市场过程始终是政治“嵌入”的，而且国家不是一个“非经济”实体，而是资本主义生产关系的一个组成部分。与国家的作用和重要性衰减的普遍观点相反，作为组织资本主义阶级关系和保证社会凝聚的框架，国家仍然是重要的制度调节中心。它们改变了自身的结构、功能和性质。因此，探讨后福特主义调节方式的存在并不是看它是否实际上回到了福特主义模式的再调节，而是看现有调节形式是否形成了一个相对稳定和持续的——当然是充满矛盾和冲突的——系统。这似乎是事实。 后福特主义积累制度促成了一种与福特主义在关键方面有所不同的调节方式。它不构成一个连贯的“项目”，而是在一个充满矛盾和冲突的过程中形成，这一过程是未完成且有争议的。主要是由福特主义形态危机和新自由主义重组战略引起的国际主导结构和社会力量关系的变化，新的资本主义增值战略及其引发的社会冲突轴心的变化。 后福特主义调节方式的主要特征包括： - 一种新的国际权力结构，以“三足鼎立”的大国间复杂的合作与冲突关系为特征，在美国的领导下明确地将边缘和半边缘区域置于从属地位； - 竞争调节的新形式，取代了福特主义时代的国家干预主义-垄断形式，与进一步资本化其他社会领域相结合，尤其是自然和知识的商品化； - 与福特主义时代聚焦于国家空间的调节方式相比，呈现出强烈的空间差异和国际化调节系统； - 最后，通过在国家、地区和地方政府之间，以及在国家和国际层面上，扩展国家-私营合作伙伴关系的扩散，明显改变并国际化了“扩展国家”。 接下来的章节将探讨国家和国家体系的转变。 新自由主义重组过程始于1970年代，带来了国家和国家体系在调节经济社会过程及其所基于的社会冲突和阶级关系中所扮演的角色的深刻变化。福特主义时代的国家类型，一个相对封闭的经济空间和社会整合型国家，在这个框架内至少在全球资本主义西北部，在统治生产关系的局限内，物质支持下的民主发展变得可能，已被扫除。传统的民族国家事实上已经变成了一个过时的模式，因此自由民主制的未来也悬而未决。 新自由主义重组的核心是对国家形式上制度化的阶级关系的重组，从而在社会力量关系中结构性地转变为有利于资本。使推动新的合理化浪潮和开辟更多的资本投资领域成为可能。它大大加速了生产的国际化和跨国公司网络的建立。资本因此能够进一步摆脱对国内市场和单一国家层面上制度化的阶级妥协的依赖。对国家体系结构的影响是深远的。国家的“调控能力”，尤其是在经济和社会政策领域，受到了严重限制，日益增长的国际经济联系打破了以前相对封闭的国民经济，社会碎片化加剧。跨国公司作为强大的行动者，拥有显著扩大的行动空间，与国家形成对立。资本和金融市场的放松管制，结合生产的国际化，加剧了地点竞争。不仅对国家，而且对地区和市政当局而言，为流动性更强的资本创造有利的增值条件变成了政治优先事项。 鉴于国家在新自由主义放松管制和私有化政策下系统地削弱了经济和社会政策的空间，人们很早就开始谈论国家“主权”的丧失（Held 1991; Cartilleri/Falk1992）。然而，这在多个方面都需要相对化。作为资本关系的一部分，以及社会阶级和力量关系的体现，国家始终受到这些因素的决定。因此，它们在法律意义上至多是主权的。更重要的是，正是国家政策启动并维持了新自由主义的转型过程。新自由主义全球化实际上更像是国家为了重组其中制度化的阶级关系而进行的一种自我转型，这一转型又受到福特主义危机改变的社会力量关系的推动。这与冷战期间和系统竞争给福特主义国家体系带来的一定稳定性的霸权集团的分崩离析有关。"},{"prompt":"请将“Theoretisch wie politisch hat diese Entwicklung einige Orientierungs-probleme nach sich gezogen. Wie immer in Zeiten größerer gesellschaftlicher Umbrüche wuchsen die Zweifel an den gewohnten Weltbildern. Verstärkt wurde dies dadurch, dass sich der Postfordismus entgegen allen Versprechungen keinesfalls als stabile Formation erwiesen hat, sondern in besonderer Weise durch die Permanenz von Krisen gekennzeichnet ist. Sowohl in der allgemeinen öffentlichen wie auch in der wissenschaftlichen Debatte blühten zunächst die Spekulationen über eine bereits stattfindende oder zumindest bevorstehende Auflösung des Staates. Auch die linke Diskussion blieb davon nicht unberührt (vgl. z.B. Gowan/Panitch/ Shaw 2001 und insbesondere Hardt/Negri 2002). In der Politikwissenschaft wurde die These formuliert, die staatliche Ordnung werde zunehmend von komplexen staatlich-privaten Netzwerken überlagert. An die Stelle hierarchisch-bürokratischer Steuerung träten immer stärker horizontale »Verhandlungssysteme« unter Beteiligung vielfältiger staatlicher und nichtstaatlicher Akteure, eine Struktur, für die sich die Bezeichnung »Governance« (im Gegensatz zu »Government«) eingebürgert hat (vgl. u.a. Held 1991, 1995; Kohler-Koch 1993; Messner 1997; Scharpf 1996; Zürn 1998). Diese Veränderungen beträfen nicht nur die innerstaatlichen Verhältnisse, sondern drückten sich auch im wachsenden Gewicht internationaler und supranationaler politischer Organisationen und Netzwerke aus, die den Bewegungsspielraum der einzelnen Staaten beschränken. Dieser Internationalisierung der politischen Apparatur entspreche ein zunehmendes Gewicht lokaler und regionaler, oft quer zu den vorhandenen Staatsgrenzen liegender politisch-ökonomischer Räume. Insgesamt beinhaltete dies eine Verabschiedung von der Vorstellung vom Staat als gesellschaftliches Steuerungszentrum. Für die materialistische Staatstheorie, die den Staat weder als Subjekt noch als über der Gesellschaft stehende Organisation, sondern als widersprüchliche Institutionalisierung sozialer Kräfteverhältnisse begreift, ist dies allerdings eine nicht unbedingt neue Erkenntnis (zur politikwissenschaftlichen Diskussion vgl. Hirsch 2002a, 117ff.). Eingezwängt zwischen diesen als »Glokalisierung« bezeichneten Entwicklungen bleibe vom herkömmlichen Nationalstaat nicht mehr viel übrig. Die »westfälische Ordnung«, d.h. das Prinzip einzelstaatlicher Souveränität, das am Ende des Dreißigjährigen Krieges im Frieden von Münster und Osnabrück kodifiziert wurde und das die internationalen Verhältnisse seither bestimmt hatte, befinde sich in Auflösung. Dem steht die Behauptung gegenüber, das nationalstaatliche System bilde, trotz einiger Modifikationen, nach wie vor Kern und Zentrum der politischen Prozesse und die laufenden Veränderungen seien nichts anderes als eine Anpassung der herkömmlichen staatlichen Struktur an veränderte ökonomisch-technische Bedingungen. Für beide Behauptungen lassen sich gute Gründe und empirische Belege anführen. Die Antwort auf die Frage nach der Zukunft des Staates ist indessen folgenreich. Es geht dabei nicht zuletzt um die Realisierbarkeit der liberalen Demokratie, die sowohl in ihrem Entstehungszusammenhang als auch in ihren Funktionsvoraussetzungen eng an den Nationalstaat gebunden ist. Dass sich der Kapitalismus grundlegend verändert hat, sollte indessen kein Anlass sein, erreichte theoretische Erkenntnisse einfach über Bord zu werfen. Es ist ein kaum bestreitbares Faktum, dass kapitalistische Pro-duktionsverhältnisse weiter herrschen und inzwischen weltweit dominierend geworden sind. Das heißt, dass Staat und das Staatensystem als Ausdruck der kapitalistischen politischen Form nach wie vor ein fundamentales Strukturmerkmal darstellen. Ebenso irreleitend wie die undifferenzierte Behauptung eines Bedeutungsverlusts der Staaten ist auch die etwas simple Unterstellung eines Verschmelzens von Staat und Kapital, d.h. eines Verschwindens von dessen »Besonderung« oder »relativer Autonomie« (so z.B. Hardt/Negri 2002). Gerade angesichts der laufenden ökonomisch-politischen Umwälzungsprozesse muss beachtet werden, dass die kapitalistische Form des Politischen - abhängig von den jeweiligen ökonomischen Strukturen und sozialen Kräfteverhältnissen - ganz unterschiedliche Ausprägungen annehmen kann. Es gibt viele Gestalten des kapitalistischen Staates. Der integrative Nationalstaat der fordistischen Epoche stellt nur eine - unter spezifischen sozialen Kräfteverhältnissen entstandene - Form der Institutionalisierung des Politischen dar. Die bürgerliche politische Form, d.h. die Trennung von Staat und Gesellschaft, von »Politik« und »Ökonomie«, die Tatsache, dass die Reproduktion der kapitalistischen Gesellschaft und die Regulation der Klassenverhältnisse eine von den Klassen formell getrennte Instanz voraussetzt, kann sich in unterschiedlichen institutionellen Formen ausdrücken. Deshalb muss man davon ausgehen, dass die aktuellen Transformationsprozesse nicht das Ende des Staates und des Staatensystems, sondern ihre Neukonfiguration beinhalten, wie sie im übrigen im historischen Verlauf, z.B. beim Ubergang zum fordistischen Interventionsstaat in der ersten Hälfte des vergangenen Jahrhunderts schon mehrmals zu beobachten war. Dies bedeutet, dass die Klassenbeziehungen neu strukturiert und in veränderten Formen institutionalisiert werden. Nach wie vor bleibt, jedenfalls in den kapitalistischen Zentren, der Staat die Instanz, die - gestützt auf seine Fähigkeit zur Steuererhebung - maßgebende infrastrukturelle Voraussetzungen des kapitalistischen Produktions- und Verwertungsprozesses zu gewährleisten hat, der wichtige Funktionen bei der Reproduktion der Arbeitskraft ausübt, der die Geldzirkulation wegen seiner Abhängigkeit vom internationalen Finanz- und Bankensystem zwar immer weniger kontrolliert, aber nach wie vor garantiert, der die wie auch immer zustande gekommenen politischen Entscheidungen durchzusetzen hat, dessen Personal sich über Wahlen rekrutiert und damit unter spezifischen politischen Legitimationszwängen steht. Er ist nach wie vor bedeutend für die Regulation der Klassenverhältnisse auf nationaler wie internationaler Ebene, und er steht gleichzeitig unter dem Zwang, den politisch-sozialen Zusammenhalt einer ökonomisch sich spaltenden und auseinanderdriftenden Gesellschaft halbwegs zu gewährleisten. Ebenso bleibt auch das internationale Kapital darauf angewiesen, dass das ökonomisch-technische und gesellschaftliche Umfeld seiner unterschiedlichen Produktionsstandorte politisch-institutionell garantiert wird. Auch dies ist auf gesellschaftliche Kräfteverhältnisse bezogen, muss politisch legitimiert und durchgesetzt werden. Deshalb verschwinden Staaten nicht einfach, noch werden sie zu schlichten Instrumenten des Kapitals. Was sich verändert hat, sind die Klassenverhältnisse und die Art und Weise ihrer politischen Institutionalisierung. Es ist falsch, die staatliche politische Form als ein dem Untergang geweihter Bestandteil einer vergangenen Gestalt des kapitalistischen Produktionsverhältnisses anzusehen (so z.B. Harris 2004). Viel mehr existiert in der Tat eine »Dialektik« zwischen kapitalistischer Globalisierung und Staatlichkeit. Der internationalisierte Wettbewerbsstaat Es erscheint zweckmäßig, die aktuellen Prozesse der Transformation von Staaten und Staatensystem unter dem Begriff Internationalisierung des Staates zusammenzufassen (vgl. Hirsch/Jessop 2001; Jessop 1997, 2002; Zürn 1998). Dabei handelt es sich sowohl um eine Internationalisierung der Staatsapparate selbst als auch um eine räumlich-soziale Diversifizierung staatlicher Ebenen und Funktionen. Dabei können mehrere Dimensionen unterschieden werden: Erstens besteht eine verstärkte Abhängigkeit der einzelnen Staatsapparate von den internationalen Kapital- und Finanzmärkten. Die dort tätigen Akteure bestimmen mittels der Wirksamkeit ökonomischer Mechanismen in einer quasi entpolitisierten Weise und relativ unabhängig von formalisierten politischen Institutionen und Entscheidungsprozessen grundsätzliche Inhalte der Politik. Die Finanzialisierung des globalen Akkumulationsprozesses unterwirft die Staaten verstärkt einer monetären Disziplin. Im innerstaatlichen Gefüge äußert sich dies im wachsenden Gewicht von Finanzministerien und Zentralbanken gegenüber den stärker auf breitere Bevölkerungsinteressen bezogenen Apparaten (Baker 1999; Lukauskas 1999).”翻译为中文","completion":"理论上和政治上，这种发展引起了一些定位问题。就像在更大的社会变革时期一样，对习惯的世界观的怀疑增加了。这种情况因后福特主义并未像所有承诺的那样证明是一种稳定的形态，而是以危机的持续性为特征而加剧。在一般的公共讨论和学术辩论中，最初盛行对国家正在发生或至少即将发生解体的猜测。左翼讨论也不例外（参见 Gowan/Panitch/Shaw 2001，尤其是 Hardt/Negri 2002）。在政治学中，提出了一种论断，即国家秩序日益被复杂的国家-私营网络所覆盖。在各种国家和非国家参与者的参与下，层级制度-官僚化的控制日渐转向水平的“谈判系统”，这种结构称为“治理”（与“政府”相对）（参见 Held 1991, 1995; Kohler-Koch 1993; Messner 1997; Scharpf 1996; Zürn 1998 等）。这些变化不仅影响国内关系，还体现在国际和超国家政治组织和网络日益增长的重要性上，这些组织和网络限制了各国的行动空间。这种政治设备的国际化对应于地方和区域政治经济空间日益增长的重要性，这些空间往往横跨现有国家边界。总体而言，这意味着摒弃将国家视为社会控制中心的观念。对于将国家既非视为主体也不视为凌驾于社会之上的组织，而是作为社会力量关系矛盾性制度化的唯物主义国家理论来说，这并非完全是新发现（关于政治学辩论，参见 Hirsch 2002a, 117ff.）。在被称为“全球化”的发展中，国家不再有多少剩余。\\"威斯特伐利亚秩序\\"，即在明斯特和奥斯纳布吕克和约中，在三十年战争结束时确立的单一国家主权原则，自那以后一直决定了国际关系，正处于解体之中。与此相反的观点是，尽管有一些修改，但国家体系仍然是政治过程的核心和中心，正在发生的变化只不过是传统国家结构对于经济-技术条件变化的适应。 可以为这两种观点提供充分的理由和实证证据。然而，对于国家未来的问题的回答具有深远的影响。这不仅关系到自由民主制的可实现性，自由民主制在其成因和运作前提上都与国家紧密相关。 尽管资本主义已经发生了根本变化，但这不应该成为抛弃已有理论认识的理由。资本主义生产关系继续统治，并且现在已经成为全球主导。这意味着国家和国家体系作为资本主义政治形式的表达，依然是一个基本的结构特征。同样误导性的是简化地假设国家和资本的融合，即国家的“特殊性”或“相对自治”的消失（例如 Hardt/Negri 2002）。特别是面对当前的经济-政治转型过程，需要注意到资本主义的政治形式可以根据特定的经济结构和社会力量关系采取不同的表现形式。资本主义国家有许多形态。整合型国家只是在特定社会力量关系下出现的政治制度化的一种形式。资本主义的政治形式，即国家与社会、\\"政治\\"与\\"经济\\"的分离，要求资本主义社会的再生产和阶级关系的调节需要一个与阶级形式上分离的实体，可以以不同的制度形式表达。 因此，我们必须认为，当前的转型过程不是国家和国家体系的终结，而是它们的重新配置，这种配置在历史上，例如在上个世纪前半叶向福特主义干预国家的过渡中，已经多次观察到。这意味着阶级关系被重新构建并以不同形式制度化。在资本主义中心，国家仍然是确保资本主义生产和增值过程的主要基础设施条件的实体，承担着劳动力再生产的重要功能，尽管由于对国际金融和银行体系的依赖，对货币流通的控制越来越少，但仍然保证实施任何形式的政治决策，其人员通过选举招募，因此处于特定的政治合法性压力之下。它仍然对国家内外的阶级关系调节至关重要，并且同时承担着保障经济分化和分裂的社会在一定程度上保持社会凝聚力的压力。同样，国际资本也依赖于其不同生产地点的经济-技术和社会环境得到政治-制度保障。这也与社会力量关系有关，需要政治合法化和实施。因此，国家不会简单消失，也不会变成资本的简单工具。变化的是阶级关系及其政治制度化的方式。错误地将国家政治形式视为资本主义生产关系过去形态中注定要灭亡的部分（例如 Harris 2004）。更确切地说，资本主义全球化和国家之间确实存在一种“辩证法”。 国际化的竞争国家 将当前的国家和国家体系转型过程归纳为国家的国际化似乎是合适的（参见 Hirsch/Jessop 2001; Jessop 1997, 2002; Zürn 1998）。这既涉及国家机构本身的国际化，也涉及国家层面和功能的空间-社会多样化。这里可以区分几个维度： 首先，个别国家机构越来越依赖国际资本和金融市场。在那里活动的参与者通过经济机制的有效性，在一种相对非政治化的方式中，相对独立于正式的政治机构和决策过程，决定了政策的基本内容。全球积累过程的金融化使国家受到更加严格的货币纪律约束。在国家内部结构中，这体现为财政部和中央银行对比更广泛的民众利益相关机构的权重增加。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The board, an elegant mix of squares and triangles, sits between two starkly contrasted figures. Reinhardt, in his distinct red jacket and casual attire, faces Meruem, the Chimera Ant King, whose appearance and aura exude an unmatched blend of nobility and raw power. The game, steeped in silence, breaks as Reinhardt decides to engage in conversation, his voice carrying a mix of casual curiosity and an underlying respect. **Reinhardt**: \\"You're quite the strategist. I've read about Gunji, but this is my first time actually playing it.\\" **Meruem**: \\"Your actions do not betray your words. For a first-time player, your moves are... intriguing. It's clear you understand more than you let on.\\" **Reinhardt**: *smiling lightly, eyes momentarily glowing red before returning to their usual color* \\"Well, I have a knack for picking things up quickly. Let's say I'm a fast learner.\\" **Meruem**, noticing the brief change but choosing to focus on the game, responds, \\"Indeed. Your adaptability is unusual. But, beyond this game, who are you? Your presence is... unfamiliar, yet not entirely human.\\" **Reinhardt** shifts slightly, the mention of his origin making him uncomfortable. However, he maintains his composure. \\"I'm just a guy who enjoys new experiences. But, your insight is sharp. I suppose it's true; I'm not entirely human.\\" **Meruem**: \\"And yet you hide your true power. I sense capabilities within you, dormant and waiting. Why?\\" **Reinhardt**: \\"We all have our secrets, don't we? Besides, isn't life more interesting when you don't reveal everything about yourself at once?\\" *He moves a piece on the board, a strategic placement that shifts the tide of their game.* **Meruem** leans forward, intrigued not just by the move but by Reinhardt himself. \\"You seek to challenge me in more ways than one. A fascinating approach. Tell me, how do you plan to win this game?\\" **Reinhardt**: \\"By playing it one move at a time. But winning isn't everything. Sometimes, it's about the experience, the challenge, and understanding your opponent.\\" **Meruem**, pausing thoughtfully, then advances one of his pieces, a critical counter-move. \\"An interesting philosophy. You are full of surprises, Reinhardt. Your approach to life, this game... it's unconventional.\\" **Reinhardt**: \\"Thanks, I guess. Life’s too short for conventions. And given my... unique background, I've learned to appreciate every moment, every encounter.\\" **Meruem**: \\"Your mysterious nature and your formidable yet concealed abilities make you an enigma, Reinhardt. One that I find myself wanting to decode.\\" **Reinhardt**: *with a genuine but guarded smile*, \\"Perhaps, one day, you will. But for now, let’s focus on this game. After all, we’re not done yet.\\" **Setting shifts back to the silence of the game, both players engrossed in their strategic battle of wits and wills, the exchange of dialogue revealing layers of complexity within Reinhardt and sparking an unmistakable curiosity within Meruem.**"},{"prompt":"this javascript animates a marker between two points.

This phenomenon typically occurs in multi-planet systems and can be a result of gravitational interactions between the planets, often through a mechanism known as planet-planet scattering. In a typical hot Jupiter scenario, the planet forms at a greater distance from its star, within a more frigid region of the protoplanetary disk, where it’s possible to accumulate a large amount of gas and ice. Some hot Jupiters then migrate inwards towards their host star, ending up in very close orbits. This inward migration can be smooth and gradual, due to interactions with the protoplanetary disk, but can also involve more violent interactions with other planets in the system. During these dynamic interactions, if the gravitational tugs between the planets are sufficiently strong and chaotic, a hot Jupiter can be ejected from its system. Such an ejection would leave the planet roaming through space as an interstellar object, no longer gravitationally bound to any star. This ejected status has significant implications for the planet: 1. **Loss of Heat Source**: Without the proximity to its host star, the planet would cool down over time, though it might retain some internal heat from radioactive decay and residual heat from its formation. 2. **Isolation**: It becomes a rogue planet, isolated in space without a star to orbit. 3. **Darkness**: The planet would not receive sunlight, making it invisible to direct observation using traditional methods that rely on starlight reflection. Discovery of such objects relies on indirect methods like gravitational microlensing or perhaps infrared observations that can detect their heat signature. 4. **Atmospheric Changes**: The lack of solar radiation and the cooling effect over time might result in significant changes to the planet's atmosphere, including potential collapse or freezing of atmospheric gases, depending on the compositions and initial conditions. Ejected hot Jupiters are a topic of interest because they challenge our understanding of planetary system formation and evolution. Their existence and properties can provide valuable insights into the dynamical processes that shape planetary systems, including our own."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

They make us who we are. **Reinhardt:** (Finds comfort in her words, realizing how rare it is to have such an open and non-judgmental conversation) That’s very true, Komugi. I think this is the most I’ve talked to someone in a long time. **The game comes to an end, with Komugi narrowly clinching victory. Both players lean back, a mutual respect formed between them.** **Komugi:** (Cheerfully) That was one of the best games I’ve ever played, Reinhardt! You’re an amazing opponent. Will you play again with me someday? **Reinhardt:** (Smiling warmly) I would like that very much, Komugi. It was an honor to play against you. And next time, maybe I’ll win. **Komugi:** (Laughs) I’ll look forward to that day! But remember, I won’t be holding back then either! **Reinhardt:** (Standing up, ready to leave but with a linger) Neither will I, Komugi. Until next time. **As Reinhardt walks away, there’s a sense of lightness in his steps, something he hadn’t felt in a long time.

L'acqua entra nei peli radicali delle radici principalmente attraverso un processo noto come osmosi. L'osmosi è il movimento dell'acqua attraverso una membrana semipermeabile da una soluzione con una minore concentrazione di soluti (sostanze disciolte) verso una soluzione con una maggiore concentrazione di soluti, al fine di bilanciare le concentrazioni su entrambi i lati della membrana. I passaggi chiave che favoriscono l'entrata dell'acqua all'interno dei peli radicali sono: 1. **Concentrazione di Soluti**: I peli radicali e le cellule delle radici delle piante accumulano attivamente sali minerali dal suolo. Questo aumenta la concentrazione di soluti all'interno delle loro cellule. 2. **Differenza di Potenziale Idrico**: A causa dell'accumulo di soluti, il potenziale idrico (una misura di energia potenziale dell'acqua che considera sia la pressione che la concentrazione di soluti) all'interno dei peli radicali diventa più basso rispetto a quello nel suolo circostante. L'acqua, seguendo il gradiente di potenziale idrico, si muove dall'ambiente circostante, dove è più alta, verso l'interno dei peli radicali, dove è più bassa. 3. **Pressione Radicale**: Alcune piante sono in grado di generare una pressione nelle radici (conosciuta come pressione radicale) che può aiutare a spingere l'acqua verso l'alto attraverso la pianta. Sebbene questo processo sia meno rilevante per l'assorbimento diretto di acqua dai peli radicali, contribuisce al movimento generale dell'acqua all'interno della pianta. 4. **Ambiente del Suolo**: La disponibilità di acqua nel suolo e la sua relazione con le particelle del suolo influenzano anche l'ingresso di acqua nei peli radicali. Un suolo bene aerato e con buona struttura favorisce una maggiore disponibilità di acqua per l'assorbimento radicale. In sintesi, l'entrata dell'acqua nei peli radicali è una conseguenza naturale del tentativo di bilanciare la concentrazione di soluti (e di conseguenza il potenziale idrico) all'interno e all'esterno della cellula vegetale. Questo processo di osmosi è vitale per il trasporto di acqua e nutrimenti all'interno delle piante, supportando così la loro crescita, fotosintesi e altri processi biologici essenziali."},{"prompt":"Parlami nello specifico del secondo punto riguardante la pressione osmotica","completion":"La pressione osmotica è un concetto cruciale per comprendere come l'acqua entra nei peli radicali delle piante attraverso il fenomeno dell'osmosi. Si tratta di una proprietà colligativa, implicando che dipende dal numero di particelle di soluto (come sali minerali e nutrienti) disciolte in una certa quantità di solvente (generalmente acqua) e non dalla natura chimica specifica delle particelle. **Comprendere la Pressione Osmotica:** 1. **Definizione di Pressione Osmotica:** La pressione osmotica può essere definita come la pressione minima necessaria da applicare a una soluzione per impedire l'ingresso di solvente attraverso una membrana semipermeabile. In termini più semplici, è la pressione generata dalla differenza nella concentrazione dei soluti su due lati della membrana. 2. **Importanza nella Radice:** Nel contesto dei peli radicali (estremità sottili delle radici giovani ricoperte di cellule molto attive nell'assorbimento di acqua e nutrienti), la pressione osmotica gioca un ruolo cruciale. La radice attivamente assorbe sali minerali dal suolo e li concentra all'interno delle sue cellule, innalzando la concentrazione interna dei soluti. Questo rende la soluzione interna più concentrata rispetto alla soluzione del suolo circostante, generando così una differenza di pressione osmotica. 3. **Movimento dell'Acqua:** A causa di questa differenza, l'acqua tende a spostarsi dall'ambiente esterno, dove ha una pressione osmotica più bassa (o un potenziale idrico più alto, poiché contiene meno soluti), verso l'interno delle cellule dei peli radicali, dove la pressione osmotica è più alta (o il potenziale idrico è più basso a causa della maggiore concentrazione di soluti). Questo movimento di acqua per osmosi avviene finché non si raggiunge un equilibrio osmotico, dove la pressione osmotica interna alle cellule è bilanciata dalla pressione meccanica esercitata dall'acqua assorbita. 4. **Rilevanza Biologica:** L'assorbimento dell'acqua nei peli radicali mediante osmosi non solo fornisce alle piante l'acqua necessaria per la fotosintesi, la crescita e altri processi metabolici, ma aiuta anche nel trasporto dei nutrienti minerali essenziali. Questi nutrienti, disciolti nell'acqua, entrano nelle piante principalmente attraverso il meccanismo dell'osmosi e della pressione osmotica generata dalle cellule radicale. In sintesi, la pressione osmotica nel contesto dei peli radicali è la forza motivante che consente l'ingresso dell'acqua all'interno delle radici delle piante, sfruttando la differenza di concentrazione dei soluti tra l'interno della radice e il suolo esterno. Questo processo è fondamentale per la sopravvivenza e il benessere delle piante."},{"prompt":"Ma il potenziale idrico da quali parametri variabili é composto ?","completion":"Il potenziale idrico (simboleggiato come Ψ) è un concetto chiave per comprendere come l'acqua si muove nei sistemi biologici, in particolare nelle piante. Il potenziale idrico è definito come la misura dell'energia potenziale dell'acqua in un sistema, confrontata con l'acqua pura (di riferimento) a pressione atmosferica e a temperatura ambiente. Si misura in megapascal (MPa). Un aspetto fondamentale del potenziale idrico è che consente di prevedere la direzione del flusso d'acqua: l'acqua si sposta sempre da aree con potenziale idrico più alto verso aree con potenziale idrico più basso. Il potenziale idrico è composto da diversi parametri variabili, che comprendono: 1. **Potenziale osmotico (Ψπ):** Rappresenta l'effetto dei soluti disciolti. In generale, l'aggiunta di soluti all'acqua riduce il suo potenziale idrico (rendendolo più negativo) perché l'energia potenziale dell'acqua diminuisce quando la sua libertà di movimento viene limitata dai soluti. Il potenziale osmotico è un fattore critico nelle cellule vegetali, dove la concentrazione di soluti all'interno delle cellule determina l'assorbimento di acqua per osmosi. 2. **Potenziale di pressione (Ψp):** Si riferisce all'effetto fisico della pressione su un sistema. Nel contesto delle cellule vegetali, quando l'acqua entra in una cellula per osmosi, la pressione turgida che si sviluppa all'interno (pressione esercitata dall'acqua contro la parete cellulare) aumenta il potenziale idrico della cellula. In condizioni turgide, il potenziale di pressione è positivo, contribuendo a un aumento complessivo del potenziale idrico all'interno della cellula. 3. **Potenziale gravitazionale (Ψg):** Si riferisce all'effetto della gravità sull'acqua. L'acqua più in alto in una pianta o in qualsiasi sistema ha un potenziale gravitazionale più basso (più negativo) rispetto all'acqua a un livello inferiore perché richiederebbe lavoro per sollevare l'acqua contro la gravità. Sebbene questo componente del potenziale idrico non sia spesso cruciale a livello cellulare, diventa significativo quando si considera il movimento dell'acqua su scale maggiori, come nella traspirazione delle piante. 4. **Potenziale matriciale (Ψm):** Riguarda l'effetto delle superfici solide o matrici sui potenziali idrici, in particolare nel suolo o nei mezzi porosi dove l'acqua può essere adsorbita o legata. L'acqua legata ha un potenziale idrico più basso (più negativo) perché è meno libera di muoversi. Questo componente è tipicamente significativo nel suolo o nelle cellule dove l'acqua può essere trattenuta fisicamente. In conclusione, il potenziale idrico (Ψ) complessivo è determinato dall'integrazione di questi vari componenti: osmotico, di pressione, gravitazionale, e matriciale. Ogni componente può influenzare il movimento dell'acqua all'interno delle piante e tra la pianta e il suo ambiente, permettendo di predire la direzione di flusso dell'acqua sulla base delle differenze nel potenziale idrico totale."},{"prompt":"Qual’e la differenza tra un peptide segnale ed una sequenza di ritenzione ? Stiamo parlando delle proteine che vengono prodotte nel Reticolo endoplasmatico rugoso di una cellula vegetale","completion":"Nel contesto della biologia cellulare e della sintesi proteica, sia i peptidi segnale che le sequenze di ritenzione hanno ruoli cruciali nel determinare il destino finale delle proteine sintetizzate, particolarmente in cellule eucariotiche, come quelle delle piante. Questi due elementi forniscono \\"indicazioni\\" alle proteine nascenti, ma hanno scopi e meccanismi d'azione differenti. # Peptidi segnale 1. **Definizione e Funzione**: Un peptide segnale è una breve sequenza di amminoacidi all'inizio (N-terminale) di una proteina nascente che ne guida il trasporto verso specifici compartimenti all'interno della cellula o per la secrezione all'esterno della cellula. Questi peptidi agiscono come un codice postale, direzionando la proteina al reticolo endoplasmatico (RE) rugoso. 2. **Meccanismo d'Azione**: Durante la sintesi proteica, quando il peptide segnale emerge dal ribosoma, è riconosciuto da un complesso proteico chiamato SRP (Signal Recognition Particle). Questa interazione porta al rallentamento della traduzione e al trasferimento del ribosoma che sintetizza la proteina al RE rugoso. Una volta che la proteina penetra nel RE, il peptide segnale viene tipicamente rimosso da un enzima chiamato signal peptidase. # Sequenze di Ritenzione 1. **Definizione e Funzione**: Una sequenza di ritenzione è una breve sequenza di amminoacidi situata solitamente verso la fine (C-terminale) o internamente alla proteina che segnala che la proteina deve rimanere all'interno di un determinato compartimento cellulare, come il reticolo endoplasmatico (RE) o l'apparato di Golgi. Esse assicurano che proteine specifiche restino confinate ai compartimenti dove svolgono la loro funzione. 2. **Meccanismo d'Azione**: Le sequenze di ritenzione sono riconosciute da recettori presenti nei compartimenti cellulari target che assicurano la ritenzione della proteina nel compartimento designato o il suo ritorno in esso se accidentalmente trasportata altrove (attraverso il processo di ricaptazione). Per esempio, una ben nota sequenza di ritenzione ER è il segnale KDEL o HDEL, che garantisce che le proteine con questo motivo restino all'interno del RE o vi siano ricondotte se escono. # Differenze Chiave La differenza fondamentale tra un peptide segnale e una sequenza di ritenzione è il loro ruolo nel determinare il destino delle proteine: - **Peptidi segnale**: Indicano inizialmente dove una proteina nascente deve essere diretta all'interno della cellula (spesso verso il RE rugoso per ulteriore modificazione o secrezione). - **Sequenze di ritenzione**: Stabiliscono dove una proteina deve risiedere in modo permanente o per la maggior parte del suo tempo funzionale, impedendone il trasporto non intenzionale ad altri compartimenti. Entrambi i sistemi sono essenziali per il corretto traffico e la funzionalità delle proteine all'interno delle cellule vegetali e offrono un affascinante insight su come le cellule eucariotiche orchestri finemente la localizzazione delle loro proteine."},{"prompt":"生物科技医疗健康相关概念 中国股市的龙头或者行业领先的有名的企业股票有哪些，另外只要国企，央企 把主营业务 代码列出啦，还有市值，只要主板股票，最少列出10个","completion":"截至到2023年4月，中国主板股票市场中，在生物科技和医疗健康领域有若干知名的国有企业或央企龙头股票。以下是一些在这一行业内较为知名的企业及其简要信息。需要注意，市场动态变化迅速，以下信息可能会随着市场和企业发展而变化，市值数据仅为大概参考。 1. **中国生物制药（1177.HK）** - 主营业务：生物药的研发、生产和销售 - 市值：约人民币数千亿元 2. **复星医药（600196.SH / 02196.HK）** - 主营业务：医药健康产业集团，涉及制药、医疗服务、医药商业及零售等领域 - 市值：约人民币数千亿元 3. **中国医药（600056.SH）** - 主营业务：药品、保健品的低温物流配送；医药商业 - 市值：约人民币数百亿元 4. **国药一致（000028.SZ）** - 主营业务：药品、医疗器械、化妆品及日用品的批发和零售等 - 市值：约人民币数百亿元 5. **齐鲁制药（600568.SH）** - 主营业务：制药，包括原料药和制剂 - 市值：约人民币数百亿元 以上列出的是几个较为知名的生物科技及医疗健康行业内的国有企业或央企，它们涵盖了药品研发、生产、销售、医药物流等多个领域。但请注意，这里提供的信息只是基于目前状况的一个大致概览，并且实际情况以及数字可能会随时变化。 同时，需要强调的是，对于具体想要投资的企业，建议仔细研究企业的年报、季报和最近的市场新闻来获取更准确和更新的信息，并以此为依据做出投资决策。"},{"prompt":"Reinhardt is a 23 Years old boy, very solitary.

Es ist ein kaum bestreitbares Faktum, dass kapitalistische Pro-duktionsverhältnisse weiter herrschen und inzwischen weltweit dominierend geworden sind. Das heißt, dass Staat und das Staatensystem als Ausdruck der kapitalistischen politischen Form nach wie vor ein fundamentales Strukturmerkmal darstellen. Ebenso irreleitend wie die undifferenzierte Behauptung eines Bedeutungsverlusts der Staaten ist auch die etwas simple Unterstellung eines Verschmelzens von Staat und Kapital, d.h. eines Verschwindens von dessen »Besonderung« oder »relativer Autonomie« (so z.B. Hardt/Negri 2002). Gerade angesichts der laufenden ökonomisch-politischen Umwälzungsprozesse muss beachtet werden, dass die kapitalistische Form des Politischen - abhängig von den jeweiligen ökonomischen Strukturen und sozialen Kräfteverhältnissen - ganz unterschiedliche Ausprägungen annehmen kann. Es gibt viele Gestalten des kapitalistischen Staates. Der integrative Nationalstaat der fordistischen Epoche stellt nur eine - unter spezifischen sozialen Kräfteverhältnissen entstandene - Form der Institutionalisierung des Politischen dar. Die bürgerliche politische Form, d.h. die Trennung von Staat und Gesellschaft, von »Politik« und »Ökonomie«, die Tatsache, dass die Reproduktion der kapitalistischen Gesellschaft und die Regulation der Klassenverhältnisse eine von den Klassen formell getrennte Instanz voraussetzt, kann sich in unterschiedlichen institutionellen Formen ausdrücken. Deshalb muss man davon ausgehen, dass die aktuellen Transformationsprozesse nicht das Ende des Staates und des Staatensystems, sondern ihre Neukonfiguration beinhalten, wie sie im übrigen im historischen Verlauf, z.B. beim Ubergang zum fordistischen Interventionsstaat in der ersten Hälfte des vergangenen Jahrhunderts schon mehrmals zu beobachten war. Dies bedeutet, dass die Klassenbeziehungen neu strukturiert und in veränderten Formen institutionalisiert werden. Nach wie vor bleibt, jedenfalls in den kapitalistischen Zentren, der Staat die Instanz, die - gestützt auf seine Fähigkeit zur Steuererhebung - maßgebende infrastrukturelle Voraussetzungen des kapitalistischen Produktions- und Verwertungsprozesses zu gewährleisten hat, der wichtige Funktionen bei der Reproduktion der Arbeitskraft ausübt, der die Geldzirkulation wegen seiner Abhängigkeit vom internationalen Finanz- und Bankensystem zwar immer weniger kontrolliert, aber nach wie vor garantiert, der die wie auch immer zustande gekommenen politischen Entscheidungen durchzusetzen hat, dessen Personal sich über Wahlen rekrutiert und damit unter spezifischen politischen Legitimationszwängen steht. Er ist nach wie vor bedeutend für die Regulation der Klassenverhältnisse auf nationaler wie internationaler Ebene, und er steht gleichzeitig unter dem Zwang, den politisch-sozialen Zusammenhalt einer ökonomisch sich spaltenden und auseinanderdriftenden Gesellschaft halbwegs zu gewährleisten. Ebenso bleibt auch das internationale Kapital darauf angewiesen, dass das ökonomisch-technische und gesellschaftliche Umfeld seiner unterschiedlichen Produktionsstandorte politisch-institutionell garantiert wird. Auch dies ist auf gesellschaftliche Kräfteverhältnisse bezogen, muss politisch legitimiert und durchgesetzt werden. Deshalb verschwinden Staaten nicht einfach, noch werden sie zu schlichten Instrumenten des Kapitals. Was sich verändert hat, sind die Klassenverhältnisse und die Art und Weise ihrer politischen Institutionalisierung. Es ist falsch, die staatliche politische Form als ein dem Untergang geweihter Bestandteil einer vergangenen Gestalt des kapitalistischen Produktionsverhältnisses anzusehen (so z.B. Harris 2004). Viel mehr existiert in der Tat eine »Dialektik« zwischen kapitalistischer Globalisierung und Staatlichkeit. Der internationalisierte Wettbewerbsstaat Es erscheint zweckmäßig, die aktuellen Prozesse der Transformation von Staaten und Staatensystem unter dem Begriff Internationalisierung des Staates zusammenzufassen (vgl. Hirsch/Jessop 2001; Jessop 1997, 2002; Zürn 1998). Dabei handelt es sich sowohl um eine Internationalisierung der Staatsapparate selbst als auch um eine räumlich-soziale Diversifizierung staatlicher Ebenen und Funktionen. Dabei können mehrere Dimensionen unterschieden werden: Erstens besteht eine verstärkte Abhängigkeit der einzelnen Staatsapparate von den internationalen Kapital- und Finanzmärkten. Die dort tätigen Akteure bestimmen mittels der Wirksamkeit ökonomischer Mechanismen in einer quasi entpolitisierten Weise und relativ unabhängig von formalisierten politischen Institutionen und Entscheidungsprozessen grundsätzliche Inhalte der Politik. Die Finanzialisierung des globalen Akkumulationsprozesses unterwirft die Staaten verstärkt einer monetären Disziplin. Im innerstaatlichen Gefüge äußert sich dies im wachsenden Gewicht von Finanzministerien und Zentralbanken gegenüber den stärker auf breitere Bevölkerungsinteressen bezogenen Apparaten (Baker 1999; Lukauskas 1999). Zweitens erhöht die grenzüberschreitende Flexibilisierung der Kapital- und Finanzströme den Druck auf die einzelnen Staaten zur Schaffung optimaler Verwertungsbedingungen. Die Staaten stehen in einer verschärften Konkurrenz um die Attraktivität ihres »Standorts« für das grenzüberschreitend mobile Kapital, die die Form eines Wettlaufs nach unten in Bezug auf Einkommen, Sozial- und Umweltstandards annehmen kann. Der Typus des fordistisch-keynesianischen Staates wird durch den post- fordistischen Wettbewerbsstaat abgelöst. Drittens kommt es zu einem Prozess, den man als »Denationalisierung« der Staaten bezeichnen kann. Die Beschränkung ihrer Interventionskapazitäten verringert die Fähigkeit zu einer integrativen gesellschaftlichen Regulierung. Sozial-räumliche Fragmentierungen nehmen zu. Wirtschaftliche Verflechtungen über einzelstaatliche Grenzen hinweg werden ebenso bedeutsamer wie die regionalen Disparitäten innerhalb der staatlichen Räume. Zugleich erzeugen wachsende internationale Ungleichheiten und Konflikte Flucht- und Migrationsbewegungen, die die Gesellschaften »multinationaler« und »multikultureller« werden lassen. Dies wiederum treibt die Umwälzung der Klassenbeziehungen und der Arbeitsverhältnisse weiter voran (Sassen 1996; Samers 1999; Pellerin 1999). Die Gesellschaften werden zugleich »multinationaler« und »multikultureller«. Damit verschwimmen die Konturen dessen, was als demokratisches »Volk« zu bezeichnen ist. Dies wiederum führt zu dem scheinbaren Paradox, dass sich die Denationalisierung des Staates mit verstärkten Privilegienkämp- fen und in deren Gefolge mit nationalistischen und rassistischen Tendenzen verbindet. Viertens wird sowohl auf einzelstaatlicher wie auf internationaler Ebene die Privatisierung von Politik vorangetrieben. Private Akteure werden für die Politikformulierung und -durchsetzung wichtiger. Ehemals staatliche Aufgaben werden privaten Unternehmen überlassen und zugleich gewinnen die multinationalen Unternehmen gegenüber den Staaten an Macht. Ausdruck der neoliberalen Transformation ist auch die steigende Bedeutung der so genannten Nichtregierungsorganisationen im Feld der internationalen Politik. Sie übernehmen - zum Beispiel in der Katastrophen- und Entwicklungshilfe - in wachsendem Umfang staatliche Aufgaben. Politik wird damit zunehmend in kaum mehr kontrollierbaren staatlich-private Verhandlungs- und Entscheidungsstrukturen verlagert. Da die Mobilisierung komplexer gesellschaftlicher Wissens- und Machtressourcen in der Konkurrenz der Standorte mittels legislativer und administrativer Maßnahmen nur beschränkt möglich ist, sind kooperative Verfahren unter Einbeziehung nicht nur der dominierenden Unternehmen, sondern auch weiterer »zivilgesellschaftlicher« Akteure verlangt. Allerdings ist der so sich herausbildende »verhandelnde Staat« keine ganz neue Erscheinung, weil Regierungen immer schon zu Kompromissen mit mächtigen gesellschaftlichen Gruppen gezwungen waren. Diese Tendenz verstärkt sich indessen im Zuge der neoliberalen Restrukturierung.”翻译为中文","completion":"资本主义的根本变化不应成为简单抛弃已有理论成果的理由。不可否认，资本主义的生产关系仍然占主导地位，并已在全球范围内成为主导。这意味着，国家及国家体系作为资本主义政治形式的体现至今仍是一个基本的结构特征。与宣称国家意义丧失的片面说法一样误导人的，是简单假设国家与资本融合，即国家的“特殊性”或“相对自主性”的消失（例如Hardt/Negri 2002）。考虑到正在进行的经济政治变革过程，必须注意到资本主义的政治形式 —— 根据特定的经济结构和社会力量关系 —— 可以呈现出极其不同的形态。资本主义国家有许多面貌。福特主义时代的整合型民族国家只是在特定社会力量关系下形成的政治制度化的一种形式。资产阶级的政治形式，即国家与社会、政治与经济的分离，资本主义社会的再生产和阶级关系的调节需要一个从阶级角度来看相对独立的机构，这一点可以在不同的制度形式中体现出来。 因此，我们必须认为，当前的转型过程并不意味着国家和国家体系的终结，而是它们的重新配置，正如历史上在过渡到福特主义干预国家的20世纪上半叶所观察到的那样。这意味着，阶级关系被重新结构化并以新的形式制度化。至少在资本主义中心，国家仍然是一个依靠征税能力来确保资本主义生产和价值实现过程的重要基础设施条件，承担着劳动力再生产的重要职能，尽管由于依赖于国际金融和银行系统，其对货币流通的控制越来越少，但仍然保证这一点，执行政治决策，其人员通过选举产生，因而处于特定的政治正当性压力之下。它仍然在国家层面和国际层面上对调节阶级关系至关重要，并同时承受着在经济分裂和分化的社会中至少部分维持政治社会凝聚力的压力。同样，国际资本也依赖于其不同生产地点的经济技术和社会环境由政治制度保障。这同样涉及到社会力量关系，必须通过政治手段获得合法性并实施。因此，国家并没有简单消失，也没有成为资本的简单工具。变化的是阶级关系及其政治制度化的方式。认为国家政治形式是资本主义生产关系过去形态中注定灭亡的部分是错误的（例如Harris 2004）。确实存在着资本主义全球化和国家性之间的“辩证关系”。 国际化竞争国家 把国家和国家体系的转型过程归纳为国家的国际化似乎是合适的（参见Hirsch/Jessop 2001; Jessop 1997, 2002; Zürn 1998）。这包括国家机构本身的国际化以及国家层面和功能的地域社会多样化。这里可以区分几个维度： 首先，各国家机构越来越依赖于国际资本和金融市场。在这些市场上活跃的行为体通过经济机制以一种几乎非政治化的方式并相对独立于正式的政治机构和决策过程，决定政策的基本内容。全球积累过程的金融化增强了国家面临的货币纪律。这在国家内部体现为财政部和中央银行的权重增加，相对于那些更关注广泛民众利益的机构（Baker 1999; Lukauskas 1999）。 其次，资本和金融流的跨境灵活性增加了对各国家创造最佳资本利用条件的压力。各国在提高其对跨境流动资本吸引力的“地点”竞争中面临加剧的压力，这可能导致收入、社会和环境标准的“竞相下降”。福特主义-凯恩斯主义国家的类型被后福特主义竞争国家所取代。 第三，可以将国家经历的过程称为“去国家化”。他们干预能力的限制减少了进行综合社会调节的能力。社会空间的碎片化增加。跨越国家边界的经济联系以及国家空间内的区域差异变得同样重要。同时，日益增长的国际不平等和冲突产生了逃亡和移民流动，使得社会变得更加“多国籍”和“多文化”。这又进一步推动了阶级关系和劳动关系的变革（Sassen 1996; Samers 1999; Pellerin 1999）。社会同时变得更加“多国籍”和“多文化”。这使得所谓民主“人民”的轮廓变得模糊。这反过来导致了似乎矛盾的现象，即国家的去国家化与加剧的特权斗争以及其后的民族主义和种族主义趋势相结合。 第四，私人行为体在政策制定和实施中变得更为重要，无论是在国家层面还是在国际层面上。以前的国家任务被私营企业接管，同时跨国公司相对于国家的权力增加。新自由主义转型的一个表现也是所谓的非政府组织在国际政治领域的重要性增加。例如在灾难和发展援助方面，它们在越来越大程度上承担着国家的任务。政治因此越来越多地转移到几乎无法控制的国家私营谈判和决策结构中。由于在地点竞争中动员复杂的社会知识和权力资源只能通过立法和行政措施有限地实现，因此需要采取合作程序，不仅包括主导企业，还包括其他“民间社会”行为体。然而，所形成的“谈判国家”并不是一个全新的现象，因为政府总是需要与强大的社会团体妥协。这种趋势在新自由主义重组的过程中却在加强。"},{"prompt":"请将“Fünftens werden politische Regelungskomplexe in Form von formalisierten internationalen Organisationen oder eher informellen »Regimes« zunehmend internationalisiert. Der Grund dafür ist, dass der globalisierte Akkumulationsprozess mit seinen krisenhaften Folgen - von zusam-menbrechenden Staaten über Finanzmarktdebakel bis hin zu grenzüber-schreitenden Umweltgefährdungen - Regulierungsanforderungen nach sich zieht, die die Kapazitäten einzelner Staaten übersteigen. Zudem versuchen die Regierungen, den Verlust ihrer Interventionsspielräume durch regionale Zusammenschlüsse zu kompensieren. Dies bindet sie in neue Kooperationszwänge ein, die insbesondere für »schwache« Staaten be-stimmender werden. Die »starken« Staaten des kapitalistischen Zentrums haben ihre Position durch die Schaffung regionaler Wirtschaftsblöcke (ins-besondere die Europäische Union und die Nordamerikanische Freihan-delszone) gefestigt. Im Ergebnis kommt es zu einer wachsenden Bedeutung internationaler Organisationen - IWF, Weltbank, OECD, WTO usw. - die deren gemeinsame Interessen organisieren und repräsentieren, aber auch zur Entwicklung weniger fest institutionalisierter Kooperationszu- ammenhänge und Netzwerke, in denen nicht nur multinationale Unternehmen, sondern auch Nichtregierungsorganisationen verschiedenster Art eine bedeutsame Rolle spielen. Es bleibt aber zu beachten, dass dadurch keine von den Einzelstaaten unabhängige internationale politische Ebene entsteht. Die internationalen Organisationen und Regime beruhen auf dem Kooperationsinteresse zumindest der starken Staaten und bleiben in ihrer Wirksamkeit von diesen bestimmt und begrenzt. Sechstens stellt schließlich die Entstehung einer internationalen, aus Unternehmensfunktionären, dem Personal staatlicher Apparate und in-ternationaler Organisationen, aber auch von Wissenschaftlerinnen und Vertreterinnen von Nichtregierungsorganisationen bestehenden interna-tionalen Kapitalisten- und Managerklasse einen besonderen Aspekt der Internationalisierung des Staates dar. Sie weist in ihrem Habitus und in ihren gesellschaftlich-politischen Orientierungen einige Gemeinsamkeiten auf (Cox 1993, 1998; van der Pijl 1997; Appeldoorn 2003). Dies bedeutet allerdings nicht, dass man von der Entstehung einer von den Staaten unabhängigen »transnationalen Kapitalistenklasse« sprechen kann. »The capitalist dass of each country retains its distinctiveness, but both the capital historically rooted there and the foreign capital that established itself alongside is now dependent on each other's states, and especially on the American state, to expand and manage the capitalist order.« (Panitch/ Gindin 2004b, 54) Nach wie vor ist die staatliche Apparatur das Terrain, auf dem sich konkurrierende kapitalistische Interessen zu einer Politik des Kapitals verdichten. Dieses Verhältnis modifiziert sich indessen dadurch, dass das Kapital den einzelnen Staaten flexibler gegenübertritt und sich wichtige Politikformulierungs- und -durchsetzungsprozesse auf die Ebene inter-nationaler Organisationen verlagern. Brand und Görg sprechen in diesem Zusammenhang unter Bezugnahme auf Poulantzas von einer institutionellen Verdichtung von Kräfteverhältnissen »zweiten Grades« (Brand/ Görg 2003, 222ff.). Die Operationsweise der internationalen Organisationen wird stark von den konkurrierenden Einzelstaaten beeinflusst, die dabei die Interessen durchaus unterschiedlicher Kapitalgruppen vertreten können. Gescheiterte internationale Wirtschaftsverhandlungen wie die um das so genannte internationale Investitionsabkommen (MAI), die WTO-Konferenz in Seattle 1999 bis hin zu den aktuellen Konflikten innerhalb der WTO legen davon Zeugnis ab. Das kapitalistische Konkurrenzverhältnis reproduziert sich auf der Ebene des Staatensystems und der internationalen Organisationen in neuer Form und sorgt dort für permanente Konflikte. Nach wie vor ist das einzelstaatliche System Grundlage der Spaltung der ausgebeuteten und abhängigen Klassen entlang nationaler Grenzen, ein Zusammenhang, der durch die vergrößerte Mobilität des Kapitals sogar eine wachsende Bedeutung erhält. Dies gestattet es auf der einen Seite, Klassen und Bevölkerungen gegeneinander auszuspielen und ist andererseits zugleich das Fundament »wohlfahrtschauvinistischer« Koalitionen, womit die klassenübergreifende Verteidigung relativer Privilegien bezeichnet wird. Diese bestimmen die politischen Verhältnisse innerhalb der konkurrierenden Staaten immer stärker. Die Internationalisierung der Staatsapparate selbst, d.h. ihre gewachsene Abhängigkeit von den internationalen Kapitalbewegungen und die damit verbundene Gewichtsverschiebung zwischen den einzelnen Teilen der Staatsadministration sorgt für eine abnehmende Bedeutung der »mas-senintegrativen«, spezifische Bevölkerungs- und Wählerinteressen reprä-sentierenden Apparate. Dies äußert sich im Abbau bzw. der Zerschlagung fordistisch-korporatistischer Institutionen und in der Transformation ehemals reformistischer »Volks«-Parteien in von ihrer sozialen Verankerung abgelöste medialisierte Wahlmaschinen. Die Folge dieses Prozesses ist, dass das Verhältnis zwischen Staat und Klassen komplexer wird und die Klassenformation im Vergleich mit dem Fordismus an Kohärenz verliert. Insbesondere nimmt die politische Formierung des kapitalistischen Machtblocks eine sehr viel komplexere, unterschiedliche Ebenen und Regulierungsbereiche umfassende Gestalt an (Wissel 2005). Das Kapital wird dadurch keineswegs »staatenlos«, sondern bezieht sich in veränderter Weise auf die Strukturen des internationalisierten Staates. Nach wie vor sind die multinationalen Unternehmungen auf die Gewalt- und Organisationspotenziale der Staaten angewiesen. Dass sie ihren Sitz fast durchweg in den politisch, ökonomisch und militärisch dominierenden Staaten des kapitalistischen Zentrums haben, ist daher kein Zufall. Immer noch sind es die Staaten, die für die soziale, ökonomische und technische Infrastruktur sorgen, die mit fortschreitender technologischer Entwicklung für den Verwertungsprozess noch bedeutsamer wird. Materielle Umverteilungen innerhalb und zwischen den Klassen sind ohne staatliche Gewalt nicht realisierbar und die Existenz von Staaten bleibt elementar für die Regulation der Klassenverhältnisse, für die Legitimation der herrschenden Verhältnisse und für die Gewährleistung eines gewissen sozialen Zusammenhalts. Staaten besitzen, abhängig von den in ihnen herrschenden sozialen Kräfteverhältnissen, nach wie vor eigene, wenn auch höchst unterschiedliche Handlungsspielräume. Dies wiederum begründet die Möglichkeit unterschiedlicher Strategien der Weltmarkteinbindung. Die daraus resultierenden Ungleichheiten, etwa was Lohnverhältnisse, ökologische Standards oder die technologische Infrastruktur angeht, sind eine entscheidende Voraussetzung des globalen Akku- mulations- und Verwertungsprozesses. Dieser beruht auf der ökonomischsozialen Fraktionierung der Welt und die Existenz der Staaten ist ausschlaggebend dafür, dass »Globalisierung« eben keine Homogenisierung der Klassen- und Ausbeutungsverhältnisse bedeutet. Die Herstellung grenzüberschreitender »Wertschöpfungsketten«, die ein entscheidendes Mittel postfordistischer Rationalisierung darstellt, beruht auf diesen Bedingungen. Je stärker sich staatliche Politik darauf konzentriert, einem global immer flexibler gewordenen Kapital in Konkurrenz mit anderen Staaten günstige Verwertungsvoraussetzungen zu schaffen, desto mehr kollidiert dies mit den Bedingungen einer ökonomisch ausgewogenen und sozial integrativen Entwicklung. Die politische Struktur des postfordistischen Kapitalismus wird damit gravierend von der Existenz eines neoliberalen Konstitutionalismus geprägt (Gill/Law 1993; Gill 1995; Scherrer 2000; Salomon 2005). Dies meint die Institutionalisierung von Regulierungs- und Entscheidungsebenen, die private Eigentums- und Marktverhältnisse auf internationaler Ebene festschreiben und damit der Reichweite demokratischer Prozesse auf einzelstaatlicher Ebene entziehen. Dazu gehören internationale Organisationen wie die Welthandelsorganisation (WTO), zwischenstaatliche Abkommen wie z.B. der Washington Konsens, aber auch regionale Einheiten wie die Europäische Union, deren geplante Verfassung die liberale Wirtschaftsordnung nun auch in kodifizierter Form garantieren und gegenüber den Mitgliedsstaaten zur Geltung bringen sollte. Die Deregulierung der Kapital- und Finanzmärkte unterwirft Regierungen und Parlamente nur schwer beeinflussbaren finanziellen Zwängen. Dadurch werden die vom Internationalen Währungsfonds kreditsuchenden Ländern auferlegten »Konditionalitäten« in gewissem Sinne verallgemeinert (Grin- spun/Kreklewich 1994).”翻译为中文","completion":"第五，以正式的国际组织或较非正式的“体制”形式存在的政治规则体系日益国际化。原因是，全球化的积累过程及其危机性后果——从国家崩溃到金融市场灾难再到跨境环境威胁——带来了超越单个国家能力的调节需求。此外，各国政府试图通过区域联合来补偿它们干预空间的损失。这使他们受到新的合作压力，特别是对“弱”国家来说更具决定性。资本主义中心的“强”国家通过创建区域经济集团（特别是欧洲联盟和北美自由贸易区）来巩固其地位。结果是，国际组织——如国际货币基金组织、世界银行、经济合作与发展组织、世界贸易组织等的重要性日益增加——它们组织和代表这些国家的共同利益，但也发展了较少制度化的合作关系和网络，在这些网络中，不仅是跨国公司，还有各种类型的非政府组织发挥着重要作用。然而，需要注意的是，这并没有创建一个独立于各国的国际政治层面。国际组织和体制基于至少是强国的合作兴趣，并且其有效性由这些国家决定和限制。 第六，由企业职能人员、国家机构人员和国际组织人员，以及科学家和非政府组织代表组成的国际资本家和管理者阶层的形成，是国家国际化的一个特殊方面。他们在习惯和社会政治取向上表现出一些共同点（Cox 1993, 1998; van der Pijl 1997; Appeldoorn 2003）。然而，这并不意味着可以谈论一个独立于国家的“跨国资本家阶级”。“每个国家的资本家阶级保持其独特性，但在那里扎根的历史资本和旁边建立的外国资本现在依赖于彼此的国家，尤其是美国国家，以扩展和管理资本主义秩序。”（Panitch/Gindin 2004b，54）国家机构仍然是将竞争的资本主义利益凝结为资本政策的舞台。然而，这种关系通过资本对各国的灵活态度和重要的政策制定和执行过程转移到国际组织层面而发生了变化。Brand和Görg在这方面引用Poulantzas的观点，谈到了一种“第二级”力量关系的制度化密集（Brand/Görg 2003，222ff）。国际组织的运作方式受到竞争国家的强烈影响，这些国家代表可能截然不同的资本集团的利益。如关于所谓的国际投资协议（MAI）、1999年西雅图WTO会议到WTO内部的当前冲突的失败的国际经济谈判就证明了这一点。资本主义的竞争关系在国家体系和国际组织层面以新形式再现，并在那里造成持续的冲突。 国家体系仍然是沿国家边界划分受剥削和依赖阶级的基础，这一点随着资本流动性的增加甚至变得更加重要。这一方面允许相互对立的阶级和人口进行操弄，另一方面也是“福利民族主义”联盟的基础，即跨阶级维护相对特权。这些特权越来越强烈地决定着竞争国家内的政治关系。 国家机构本身的国际化，即它们对国际资本流动的增加依赖以及与之相关的州内行政部门之间重量的转移，导致代表特定人口和选民利益的“大众融合”机构的重要性下降。这表现在福特主义-公司主义机构的削弱或解体，以及曾经的改革主义“民族”党派转变为从其社会根基中脱节的媒体化选举机器。这一过程的结果是，国家与阶级之间的关系变得更加复杂，与福特主义相比，阶级形势的连贯性减弱。尤其是，资本主义力量集团的政治形成呈现出更为复杂的面貌，涵盖不同层面和调整领域（Wissel 2005）。 资本并非“无国界”，而是以改变的方式参照国际化的国家结构。跨国公司仍然依赖国家的暴力和组织潜力。它们几乎全部位于资本主义中心的政治、经济和军事主导国家，这并非巧合。国家仍然负责提供随着技术发展对生产过程越来越重要的社会、经济和技术基础设施。阶级内部和阶级之间的物质重分配离不开国家力量，国家的存在对于阶级关系的调整、现有关系的合法化以及一定程度的社会凝聚至关重要。国家根据其内部占主导地位的社会力量关系，仍具有自己的、尽管高度不同的行动空间。这反过来又为世界市场融入的不同策略提供了可能性。由此产生的不平等，例如在工资关系、生态标准或技术基础设施方面，是全球积累和价值实现过程的关键条件。这一过程基于世界的经济社会分割，国家的存在对于确保“全球化”并不意味着阶级和剥削关系的同质化至关重要。建立跨境“价值链”，作为后福特主义合理化的关键手段，依赖于这些条件。随着国家政策越来越专注于为全球愈发灵活的资本创造有利的价值实现条件，与其他国家竞争，这与经济均衡和社会融合发展的条件相冲突。 后福特主义资本主义的政治结构因此受到新自由主义宪政主义的重大影响（Gill/Law 1993; Gill 1995; Scherrer 2000; Salomon 2005）。这意味着在国际层面上确立私有财产和市场关系的规制和决策水平的制度化，进而使其脱离单个国家层面的民主过程。这包括国际组织如世界贸易组织（WTO）、国家间协议如华盛顿共识，以及区域实体如欧洲联盟，其计划中的宪法现在也以编写形式保证并向成员国施加自由市场秩序。资本和金融市场的放松使政府和议会面临难以影响的财务压力。因此，国际货币基金组织强加给借款国的“条件”在某种程度上变得普遍化（Grinspun/Kreklewich 1994）。"},{"prompt":"请将“Die staatliche Garantie optimaler Verwertungsbedingungen beschränkt sich nicht auf Maßnahmen zur Einkommenssenkung für die Lohnabhängigen (Deregulierung der Lohnverhältnisse, Abbau sozialstaatlicher Sicherungen) und die Ausdehnung der Marktverhältnisse. Sie zielt auch auf die Herstellung der Bedingungen für komplexe systemische Rationalisierungsprozesse. Dazu gehören die Schaffung von Technologiepolen und die Förderung industrieller Cluster, die infrastrukturelle Unterstützung und Subventionierung unternehmerischer Forschung und Entwicklung, die Anpassung der Arbeitskräftequalifikation an den unternehmerischen Bedarf und die Herstellung komplexer Wissenssysteme. Wenn dies zu einer wachsenden Abhängigkeit der Unternehmen von räumlichen Standortbedingungen führt, so gilt zugleich, dass diese Räume nicht beliebig herstellbar sind, sondern in ihrer Entwicklung an spezifische kulturelle und soziale Vorbedingungen gebunden bleiben. Die räumliche Spezialisierung wird zu einem wesentlichen Faktor internationaler Standortkonkurrenz. Daraus folgt, dass der globale Akkumulationsprozess keineswegs und in gewisser Weise weniger denn je nur auf der Dynamik unternehmerischer Konkurrenz und dem Wirken der Marktkräfte beruht, sondern nach wie vor von politischer Regulierung abhängt. »Märkte« sind keine Naturphänomene, sondern politisch-institutionell - durch die Garantie des Pri-vateigentums, Rechtssysteme, Zugangs- und Monopolkontrollen - hergestellte Verhältnisse. Die Globalisierung und Internationalisierung des Kapitals verbindet sich daher mit einer eher zunehmenden Bedeutung administrativer und legislativer Staatstätigkeit, wenn auch in gegenüber dem Fordismus stark veränderten Formen. Nicht mehr der Schutz »nationaler« Industrien, sondern die Gewährleistung der internationalen Konkurrenzfähigkeit ausgewählter Sektoren, Marktliberalisierung in Verbindung mit einer unternehmerische Investitionen fördernden »Angebotspolitik« stehen im Zentrum. Die Funktionslogik des internationalisierten Wettbewerbsstaates beruht also, etwas überspitzt ausgedrückt, in der alle sozialen Sphären umgreifenden Ausrichtung der Gesellschaft auf das Ziel globaler Wettbewerbsfähigkeit. Es geht um eine umfassende Mobilisierung der Bevölkerung für einen »Wirtschaftskrieg«, der dann am ehesten zu gewinnen ist, wenn sich die Nationen selbst als kapitalistische Unternehmen begreifen: hierarchisch strukturiert, auf ökonomische Ziele ausgerichtet, in ProfitCenter unterteilt, glatt und effizient funktionierend, autoritär geführt, in Kern- und Randbelegschaften aufgeteilt, mit beschränkten Mitbestimmungsrechten und loyalen Innovations-, Produktivität^- und Qualitätszirkeln (Balibar 1993, 98). Insgesamt beinhaltet dies eine weitreichende Ökonomisierung der gesellschaftlichen Beziehungen. Die Durchsetzung von Marktverhältnissen in weiten Teilen der Gesellschaft, z.B. im Sozial-, Gesundheits- und Bildungssystem ist ein signifikantes Merkmal des post- fordistischen Akkumulationstyps. Die ökonomische Sphäre wird ausgeweitet und durchdringt die Staatsapparate (Jessop 2000). Das einzelstaatliche System geht durch diese Entwicklung nicht unter, sondern unterliegt einer grundlegenden Transformation. Die Tendenz zur Regionalisierung der Weltwirtschaft und zur Herausbildung konkurrierender Wirtschaftsblöcke ist Antriebsmoment für die Internationalisierung des Kapitals. Sie zwingt die großen Unternehmen dazu, in mehreren Wirtschaftsräumen gleichzeitig präsent zu sein und ihre Investitionen entsprechend zu verteilen. »Globalisierung« bedeutet für die multi-nationalen Konzerne demnach vor allem die Besetzung nach wie vor voneinander getrennter nationaler bzw. regionaler Märkte. Was aus der Globalisierung weitgehend herausfällt, sind die Arbeitsmärkte. Nationalstaatliche Grenzziehungen beschränken noch immer eine Freizügigkeit der Arbeitskräfte, die der des Kapitals entspräche. Sie bewirken gleichZeitig mehr oder weniger legale Migrationsbewegungen, die zur Umwälzung der Lohn- und Arbeitsverhältnisse beitragen. Dies bedeutet, dass eine entscheidende Funktion der nationalstaatlichen Organisation, die Aufrechterhaltung unterschiedlicher Einkommens- und Lebensbedingungen auf dem Weltmarkt, erhalten bleibt. Eine neue Raummatrix des Politischen Der Prozess der Internationalisierung des Staates bedeutet, dass sich das Verhältnis von »Staat« und »Gesellschaft« in globalem Maßstab neu konfiguriert. Damit nimmt die institutionelle Ausformung der Staatsapparatur eine komplexere Gestalt an. Wenn politisch-administrative Regulie- rungs- und Steuerungsfunktionen sich vom Nationalstaat auf die subnationale, regionale und internationale Ebene verlagern, dann ist der Begriff der »Ebene« keinesfalls nur geografisch-räumlich zu begreifen. Vielmehr wird damit ein System sich in ihrer Wirkungsreichweite sowohl unterscheidender als auch überschneidender und überlappender, mehr oder weniger stark institutionalisierter Regelungskomplexe bezeichnet, die sich auf unterschiedliche, wenn auch nicht voneinander unabhängige Materien und Problemfelder beziehen und in denen sich jeweils unterschiedliche soziale (Klassen-)Kräfteverhältnisse verdichten (Jessop 2002; Keil/Brenner 2003; Brand/Görg 2003, 214ff.). David Harvey verwendet dafür den Begriff der »raum-zeitlichen Fixierung« (spatio-temporal fix). Damit ist gemeint, dass der kapitalistische Akkumulationsprozess und seine Regulation sich immer in bestimmten raum-zeitlichen Dimensionen materialisiert und dass die Art und Weise, wie das geschieht, zugleich eine Form darstellt, in der die darin enthaltenen Widersprüche bearbeitet werden können (Harvey 1982; vgl. auch Jessop 2001a). Politisch-soziale Räume sind nicht einfach vorgegeben, sondern das Ergebnis konflikthafter Vergesellschaftungs- und Auseinandersetzungs-prozesse. Sie entstehen sowohl als Ergebnis einer Verdichtung ökonomischer, sozialer und kultureller Interaktionen als auch durch Macht- und Herrschaftsstrategien. In diesem Sinne sind sie keine Naturgegebenheiten, sondern soziale Konstruktionen, die gleichwohl eine materielle Grundlage haben (vgl. Delaney/Leitner 1997; Marston 2000; Swyngedouw 1997). Räume werden durch soziale Prozesse von Herrschaft und Kontrolle konstituiert und sind deshalb als Machtdispositive anzusehen, die politisch- soziale Zugehörigkeiten, Ein- und Ausschlussprozesse sowohl symbolisieren als auch materiell fixieren. Sie sind das Ergebnis institutionalisierter sozialer Kompromisse und Herrschaftsverhältnisse, mit denen - nicht zuletzt auf dem Wege einer Externalisierung von Kosten (z.B. im Verhältnis von »erster« und »dritter« Welt) und der Festschreibung von Ausbeutungsverhältnissen im Verhältnis zu anderen sozialen Sphären - der Zusammenhalt zwischen verschiedenen konfligierenden Akteuren hergestellt wird (Jessop 2001a). So hatte die Konstitution des nationalstaatlichen Raums sowohl die Bildung kapitalistischer Marktverhältnisse als auch lang anhaltende (Klassenkampfe um die Zentralisierung der politischen Gewalt im Zuge des Übergangs zum Kapitalismus zur Voraussetzung. Zugleich führte sie zu einer Neukonfigurierung globaler Ungleichheits- und Abhängigkeitsbeziehungen und implizierte komplexe Klassenspaltungen. Auch verbirgt sich hinter der Metapher des nationalstaatlichen Raums die Tatsache, dass nicht alle darin Lebenden in die ihn konstituierenden sozialen Kompromisse einbezogen sind. Im Zuge der neoliberalen Restrukturierung des Kapitalismus und der sie begleitenden Veränderung der Transport- und Kommunikationstechnologien kommt es zu weitreichenden Verschiebungen des Raumgefüges. Dieser Prozess kann als eine Form von raum-zeitlicher Kompression beschrieben werden (Jessop 2001a/b). Räume rücken näher zusammen und können auf neue Weise horizontal und vertikal miteinander verbunden werden. Durch das Internet ist ein Kommunikationsraum fast globaler Dimension entstanden. Dies bedeutet indessen nicht die Entstehung eines homogenen und linearen, die Welt umfassenden Raumes, sondern eine Neukonfiguration des Raumgefüges, wodurch globale, regionale, staatliche und lokale Räume in neuer Weise sowohl getrennt als auch verbunden werden.”翻译为中文","completion":"国家保障最佳资本利用条件的保证并不仅限于对工资从业者收入的降低措施（工资关系的放松、削减社会保障措施）以及市场关系的扩展。它还旨在为复杂的系统性合理化过程创造条件。这包括创建技术中心和促进工业集群、对企业研发的基础设施支持和补贴、将劳动力技能调整为满足企业需求以及创建复杂的知识系统。如果这导致公司越来越依赖于空间位置条件，同样，这些空间并非随意可建造，而是其发展仍然受限于具体的文化和社会前提条件。空间专业化成为国际位置竞争的一个重要因素。 由此可见，全球积累过程决不仅仅基于企业竞争的动力和市场力量的作用，而且比以往任何时候都更依赖于政治调节。“市场”不是自然现象，而是政治制度化的产物——通过私有财产保障、法律体系、准入和垄断控制创建的。因此，资本的全球化和国际化与行政和立法国家活动的重要性不断增加联系在一起，尽管与福特主义相比，形式有了很大变化。现在的重点不再是保护“国家”产业，而是保证选定部门的国际竞争力、市场自由化结合鼓励企业投资的“供给政策”。 因此，国际化竞争国家的功能逻辑，在某种程度上说，就是以全球竞争力为目标的社会的全面动员。这涉及到全面动员人口参与一场“经济战”，如果国家自我理解为资本主义企业，这场战斗最有可能获胜：层级结构清晰，面向经济目标，划分为利润中心，运行流畅高效，权威管理，人员分为核心和边缘，民主参与权利有限，忠诚的创新、生产力和质量圈（Balibar 1993，98）。总的来说，这涉及到社会关系的广泛经济化。市场关系在社会的许多部分的推广，例如在社会、健康和教育系统中，是后福特主义积累类型的一个显著特征。经济领域得到扩展并渗透到国家机构中（Jessop 2000）。 国家体系不会因此消亡，而是经历了根本性的转变。全球经济的区域化和竞争经济集团的形成是资本国际化的驱动力。这迫使大公司必须同时存在于多个经济区域，并相应地分配其投资。“全球化”对跨国公司而言，主要意味着占领仍然彼此分隔的国家或区域市场。从全球化中大体上排除的是劳动力市场。国家边界仍然限制了劳动力的自由流动，这与资本的自由流动相对应。同时，这也导致了或多或少合法的移民流动，促成了工资和劳动条件的变革。这意味着，维持世界市场上不同收入和生活条件的国家组织的关键功能得以保留。 政治的新空间矩阵 国家国际化的过程意味着“国家”与“社会”的关系在全球范围内重新构型。这导致国家机构的结构变得更加复杂。当政治行政调节和控制功能从国家层面转移到次国家、区域和国际层面时，“层次”的概念绝不仅仅是地理空间上的理解。反而，它指的是一个既有差异性又有交叉和重叠，不同程度制度化的规则体系系统，这些体系与不同但又相互依赖的事项和问题领域相关，在其中不同的社会（阶级）力量关系得以凝结（Jessop 2002; Keil/Brenner 2003; Brand/Görg 2003, 214ff）。David Harvey使用了“时空固定”（spatio-temporal fix）的概念来描述这一点。这意味着资本主义积累过程及其调节总是具体化于特定的时空维度中，且其实现方式同时也是处理其中矛盾的一种形式（Harvey 1982；参见Jessop 2001a）。 政治社会空间不是简单给定的，而是冲突性社会化和争论过程的结果。它们既是经济、社会和文化互动密集的结果，也是权力和统治策略的产物。从这个意义上，它们不是自然现象，而是具有物质基础的社会构建（参见Delaney/Leitner 1997; Marston 2000; Swyngedouw 1997）。空间通过支配和控制的社会过程构成，因此被视为权力装置，它们在象征和物质上固定了政治社会归属、包容和排除过程。它们是制度化的社会妥协和统治关系的结果，通过这些关系——不仅通过成本的外部化（例如“第一世界”与“第三世界”的关系）和在其他社会领域固定剥削关系——在不同冲突行为者之间建立凝聚力（Jessop 2001a）。 随着资本主义的新自由主义重组以及伴随的交通和通信技术变革，空间结构经历了深远的转变。这个过程可以被描述为一种时空压缩形式（Jessop 2001a/b）。空间被拉近，并能以新的方式水平和垂直连接。通过互联网产生了几乎是全球维度的通信空间。然而，这并不意味着产生了一个同质化和线性的、覆盖全球的空间，而是空间结构的重新构型，使得全球、区域、国家和地方空间以新的方式被分隔和连接。"},{"prompt":"Kindly Share the Achievement on the below mey data","completion":"It appears that you're asking about achievements related to a specific set of data, but you haven't provided the actual data or details about the context (e.g., scientific research, personal achievements, corporate milestones, etc.).

He’s Born between an human father and a woman Phoenix. He has short and brown hair and wears jeans, black turtleneck and red jacket with white fur.

Meruem explains that a chimera ant eated a Phoenix, and and Hybrid Is created, Reinhardt Is shocked","completion":"In a dimly lit, secluded corner of an ancient library, where secrets seemed to whisper from every shadowed nook, Reinhardt, his brown hair slightly disheveled and his posture guarded, found himself in an unexpected conversation with Meruem, the Chimera Ant King. The air around them was thick with the tension of unveiled truths and the potential for profound revelations. Meruem, whose presence commanded attention even in silence, began speaking in a tone that seemed to weigh every word, \\"There exists a peculiar phenomenon within my kind, the Chimera Ants. When one consumes a being of significant power, a hybrid with combined traits is birthed. This is how I have come to stand before you, a blend of numerous creatures, each lending me their strength.\\" Reinhardt, his curiosity piqued despite his usual reticence about his origins, leaned in ever so slightly. The scar on his neck itched beneath his turtleneck, a physical reminder of his own mixed heritage. Meruem continued, his gaze piercing, \\"Recently, a member of my kind consumed a Phoenix. This act was not merely an addition of power but an amalgamation of essence. A hybrid was created, a being with capabilities reminiscent of what you possess.\\" Reinhardt's breath caught in his throat, and for a moment, his usually hidden red eyes flared to life, seeking the truth in Meruem's statement. The library around them seemed to recede into insignificance as the potential implications of Meruem's words took hold. \\"Are you saying... that there's another... like me?\\" Reinhardt's voice was a mixture of disbelief and a thinly veiled longing for connection, a longing he had buried deep inside. The thought of someone else bearing the fire of a Phoenix within them sparked an undeniable curiosity. Meruem nodded solemnly, \\"Yes. This hybrid possesses a unique set of abilities, likely different yet born of the same essence that courses through you. The act of creating life from the consumption of a Phoenix has profound implications. It suggests a potential kinship between you and the Chimera Ants, a shared lineage through the Phoenix.\\" The quiet that followed was charged with Reinhardt's internal turmoil. His mind raced with questions about identity, purpose, and the nature of his existence. The Phoenix part of him, usually so vibrant and fiery, felt momentarily subdued, overshadowed by the weight of revelation. \\"Kinship...\\" Reinhardt echoed, the word tasting foreign on his tongue. He had always felt alone in his abilities, secluded even amidst crowds, and to consider that there might be others who shared aspects of his heritage was both exhilarating and terrifying. Meruem observed Reinhardt with a mix of curiosity and respect. \\"Indeed. The existence of such beings challenges the boundaries of what we understand about power and lineage. You, Reinhardt, stand as a bridge between worlds, human and Phoenix, just as this new hybrid connects the Chimera Ants to something beyond their comprehension.\\" Reinhardt's red eyes dimmed as he processed Meruem's words, once again cloaked in the guise of an ordinary young man. Yet, inside, a shift had occurred. The revelation of another being born from the essence of a Phoenix, through circumstances so different from his own, opened up a myriad of possibilities and questions about his place in the world. After a long pause, Reinhardt finally spoke, his voice more composed but filled with a new resolve, \\"I must learn more about this hybrid.
