Unlike other creatures from different planets, Zog was green, squishy, gelatinous, and had tentacles that wriggled and wiggled around as he moved. Despite his strange appearance, Zog was a friendly and curious creature who loved exploring the vast universe. One day, while traveling through space in his spaceship, Zog’s radar detected a distress signal coming from a nearby planet. Without hesitation, Zog headed towards the planet to offer his help. As he landed on the planet’s surface, Zog was greeted by a group of frightened creatures. They explained that their planet was under attack by a powerful enemy, and they were in desperate need of assistance. Zog knew he had to help them, so he sprang into action. Using his tentacles, Zog quickly built a force field around the planet, protecting it from the enemy’s attacks. The creatures were amazed at Zog’s abilities and thanked him for coming to their rescue. Zog stayed on the planet for several days, helping the creatures rebuild their homes and defenses. During this time, he learned about their culture and traditions, and made many friends along the way. Eventually, the enemy retreated, and the planet was safe once again. The creatures thanked Zog for his bravery and kindness, and begged him to stay with them permanently. But Zog knew that his true purpose was to continue exploring the universe and helping those in need. With a heavy heart, Zog bid farewell to his new friends and set off into the stars once again. As he flew through space, Zog couldn’t help but feel grateful for the amazing experiences he had encountered and the friendships he had made. And so, the gelatinous alien named Zog continued his journey through the universe, always ready to lend a helping tentacle wherever it was needed. Write a story back on his planet, where a more solid creature sees him wobbling and jiggling, and touches him, and she is surprised her hand sinks into his jelly like body Back on Zog’s home planet, he was a well-known and respected explorer among his fellow gelatinous aliens. His adventures were the talk of the town, and everyone was eager to hear about his latest travels and discoveries. One day, as Zog was strolling through the bustling streets of his planet’s capital city, he caught the eye of a solid creature named Lila. Lila had never seen a gelatinous alien before, and she was curious about Zog’s unique appearance. His squishy, green body wobbled and jiggled with every step he took, and his tentacles swayed gracefully behind him. Intrigued, Lila approached Zog and reached out to touch him. As her hand made contact with Zog’s jelly-like body, she gasped in surprise as her hand sank into his soft, squishy exterior. She could feel the cool, slimy texture of Zog’s gelatinous form enveloping her hand, and she couldn’t help but be amazed by the experience. Zog chuckled softly at Lila’s reaction and explained to her that his body was made of a special gel-like substance that allowed him to move and adapt to different environments. He reassured her that he was perfectly harmless and merely a different kind of alien species. As Lila withdrew her hand from Zog’s body, she marveled at the encounter and couldn’t help but feel a sense of wonder at the diversity of life in the universe. She thanked Zog for allowing her to touch him and learn more about his unique biology. From that day on, Lila and Zog became friends, bonding over their shared curiosity and appreciation for the beauty of the cosmos. They would often meet up to discuss their respective worlds and exchange stories of their adventures. And as they gazed up at the stars together, they knew that their friendship would span across galaxies and beyond. Write about his appearance Zog was unlike any other alien on his home planet. His squishy, gelatinous body was a vibrant shade of green, glistening in the sunlight as he moved. His body rippled and wobbled with each step he took, giving him a fluid and graceful appearance. His form was constantly shifting and undulating, as if he was made of liquid rather than solid matter. Zog’s most striking feature was his tentacles. They sprouted from his body, wriggling and waving in the air as he moved. Each tentacle was long and flexible, resembling thick strands of jelly that swirled and twisted in intricate patterns. Despite their unusual appearance, Zog’s tentacles were incredibly versatile, allowing him to perform a variety of tasks with ease. His large, expressive eyes were a brilliant shade of turquoise, glowing with intelligence and curiosity. They sparkled with an otherworldly light, captivating anyone who met his gaze. Zog’s gaze was warm and welcoming, reflecting his kind and gentle nature. Overall, Zog’s appearance was both fascinating and mesmerizing, drawing the attention of all who encountered him. His unique blend of squishy, gelatinous body and waving tentacles made him a truly one-of-a-kind alien, a creature of beauty and wonder in the vast expanse of the universe. Write a story where he is exploring then he trips falls and lands on his butt, He laughs it off Zog was on one of his many exploration missions, traversing through a lush forest on a distant planet. His tentacles gracefully swayed as he moved, his eyes wide with wonder at the exotic flora and fauna around him. The air was filled with strange, unfamiliar scents, and the sounds of alien creatures echoed through the trees. As he journeyed deeper into the forest, Zog suddenly stumbled over a protruding tree root and tumbled forward, landing on his squishy, gelatinous butt with a soft squelch. He let out a surprised squeak as he landed, his tentacles flailing in the air for a moment before regaining their balance. But instead of feeling embarrassed or frustrated, Zog simply burst into laughter at his clumsy mishap. His laughter rang out through the forest, a joyous and infectious sound that seemed to brighten the surroundings. The strange creatures nearby curiously peeked out from their hiding spots, intrigued by the jovial alien who had stumbled upon their world. Brushing himself off, Zog stood up and dusted off his green, squishy body, his eyes twinkling with amusement. He couldn’t help but chuckle at his own clumsiness, finding humor in the unexpected turn of events. With a light-hearted spirit, Zog continued on his exploration, his laughter ringing through the forest as he discovered new wonders and delights around every corner. And though he may have tripped and fallen on his butt, Zog knew that sometimes a little stumble could lead to the greatest of adventures. The end. Write a story on a warm day where he begins to melt, he first notices when his bottom tentacles are more squishy and squelchy than usual On a distant planet where the twin suns shone more brightly than any stars in the known universe, Zog the gelatinous alien was out on another fascinating exploration. The warm atmosphere was a delightful change from the cold vacuum of space he was accustomed to navigating. However, what Zog hadn’t accounted for was the planet’s unusually high temperatures, especially during the midday peak. As he ventured through a vast desert, the land glistened like a sea of gold under the intense sunlight. The heat was intense but invigorating, and Zog reveled in the adventure, his tentacles leaving whimsical patterns in the sandy dunes. It was during one of these joyful strides that Zog first noticed something odd about his locomotion. His bottom tentacles felt unusually soft and pliable, almost as if they were losing their firmness. Puzzled, Zog halted and reached down to inspect one of his tendrils. To his surprise, his tentacle was indeed squishier and more squelchy than usual, leaving a wet imprint on the hot sand as it withdrew. Alarmed by this discovery, Zog soon realized that the scorching heat was causing him to melt slightly. His gelatinous composition, perfect for withstanding the cold of space and many other environments, wasn’t quite suited for such extreme warmth. He saw his body losing its usual shape, becoming more fluid and spread out. Determined not to be defeated by this new challenge, Zog hurriedly sought out shade. He slithered his way toward a nearby rock formation, noting the urgency as more of his form began to droop. His movement slowed as his melting increased, and it became a race against time. When Zog finally reached the shelter of shadow, he could feel the immediate difference. Though still warm, the shade provided a respite from the direct heat of the suns. He stretched out, allowing his body to cool down and regain its usual consistency. As he rested, Zog contemplated how he could continue his explorations without becoming a puddle of alien goo. After some thought, Zog gathered materials from his surroundings. Using a combination of sun-reflective rocks and the shadows cast by the wispy desert plants, he constructed a makeshift umbrella. It was a peculiar sight—a green, gelatinous alien holding a canopy of rocks and branches—but it was effective. Once he had consolidated back to his normal squishy self, Zog continued on his journey, now safely beneath his handcrafted shield from the suns. Though his pace was cautious and his appearance might have seemed comical to any onlookers, Zog didn’t mind. He carried on with his exploration, ever the curious and adaptive traveler. And so, despite nearly melting on the sweltering planet, Zog learned a valuable lesson in adaptability and resourcefulness, adding yet another incredible experience to his intergalactic adventures. Write a story where one day he lands on a boiling planet and instantly becomes a puddle, and oozes back into his ship Zog’s insatiable curiosity had led him to a spectrum of galaxies, each with their own quirks and quandaries. This time, his ship’s sensors had pinpointed a fascinating planet, known for its geothermal wonders. Charts declared it a boiling cauldron of geysers and lava lakes, a spectacle not many had dared to witness up close. Eager to catalog the unique environment, Zog set his spaceship’s course for this sizzling sphere. He descended through the swirling steam and sulfuric clouds, his ship’s shields glowing from the ambient heat. As the vessel’s landing gear made contact with stone, Zog could already feel the warmth seeping into the cabin. He performed a quick scan, concluding it was safe but hot — nothing his squishy composition hadn’t faced before. Or so he thought. The ship’s hatch hissed open, and Zog extended a tentative tentacle to the ground below. But as soon as his gelatinous form met the scorching surface, he felt a sensation he had never experienced. His body didn’t resist the heat—it surrendered to it. In an instant, Zog transformed from a well-defined being into a puddle of green ooze, his previously distinct tentacles now melded into a shapeless blob. With no time to process the shock, Zog’s fluid form began flowing, carried by the ship’s slight incline back towards the hatch. His mind, somehow still functioning within his liquified state, raced with alarm and ingenuity. He couldn’t speak or reach the controls, but his form instinctively flowed towards safety. Puddle Zog seeped across the metal threshold, retreating from the unbearable heat of the planetary surface. Once fully within the ship, away from the torturous temperature, the hatch closed automatically, prompting the interior to cool rapidly thanks to the high-tech environmental systems. Zog’s liquid mass quivered in place, starting a slow but sure process of reconstitution. His puddled body began to rise and take shape once more, pulling itself together with incredible resilience inherent to his species. As his form solidified, his thoughts began to clear, and he pondered his near-disastrous descent onto the boiling planet. While initially frustrated by this setback, Zog’s innate curiosity and optimism soon took over. He recognized this experience as a valuable lesson in the limitations of exploration and the importance of respecting the raw power of natural forces. With a newfound appreciation for the cooler confines of his spaceship, Zog maneuvered his ship away from the perilous planet, his spirit undampened. The adventure had been brief and almost catastrophic, but it served as a poignant reminder that the universe was full of unexpected challenges. His gelatinous body now intact, Zog logged the boiling planet in his database with a warning for future travelers before setting his sights on the next cosmic marvel. There was no telling what he’d encounter next, but one thing was for sure: Zog’s adventurous spirit would always find a way to ooze through adversity. Write a story where he is with his sister, Euyue, who is pink Zog had visited countless worlds, each with its own tale to tell, braving them mostly in solitude. Yet, there was one companion who seemed to rival his odyssey thirst—his sister, Euyue. Unlike Zog’s verdant hue, Euyue was a striking shade of pink that shone luminescently, her gelatinous form bouncing light in delicate rosy arcs. On a day when the twin moons of their home planet aligned, Zog proposed that Euyue accompany him on an adventure to the fabled Crystal Caverns of Glistaria, a celestial body renowned for its prismatic subterranean passages. Euyue, with her adventurous heart beating in rhythm with her brother’s, joyously accepted. Together, they set off in Zog’s spaceship, the journey passing with tales of past exploits and shared laughter that only siblings could understand. Upon reaching Glistaria, they marveled at its surface glittering like a gemstone in the celestial sea. The planet’s caves promised treasures of unimagined beauty, and both Zog and Euyue were eager to explore. As the siblings ventured into the Crystal Caverns, their squishy, translucent bodies shimmered against the kaleidoscope of colors. The walls of the cave were lined with crystals that ranged from deepest amethyst to the softest sapphire, and the lights of Zog’s and Euyue’s physical forms danced in reflections throughout the cavern. As they delved deeper, the crystals started to resonate with their presence, humming a tune that felt ancient and otherworldly. Euyue reached out a tentacle to softly caress a crystal, and to their surprise, it responded to her touch with a warm glow that grew more intense, as if it recognized the kinship between their mutual structures. It was then that the cavern came alive with light and sound, filled with harmonics that celebrated the siblings’ exploration. Zog and Euyue, undaunted by the display, pressed forward, marveling at the wonders that unfolded before them. Their movements were careful, respectful of the natural majesty surrounding them. The deeper into the caverns they went, the more the atmosphere seemed imbued with a magic neither had felt before. It was Euyue, with her innate empathy, who first felt the cavern’s consciousness. She sensed an ancient knowledge within the stone, an eternal depth that was at once alien and familiar. “We’re not merely explorers here,” Euyue whispered to her brother. “We’re part of the cavern’s story now, part of its endless melody.” Zog looked at Euyue, her pink form aglow with the light of countless crystals, and knew she was right. They were no longer just visitors in a foreign land; they had become a chapter in Glistaria’s chronicle. When the time came to depart, they did so with a gentle reverence. In silence, they made their way back to the surface, where Zog’s ship awaited their return. Once aboard, they shared a serene smile, an unspoken understanding of their shared connection with something far greater than themselves. As they journeyed back to their home planet, Euyue rested her tentacle gently upon Zog’s. Their exploration had become more than a thrilling escapade; it had been an affirmation of their bonds, to each other and to the grand tapestry of the cosmos. Zog and Euyue’s visit to the Crystal Caverns of Glistaria was not just another entry in Zog’s log of adventures; it was a testament to the profound encounters that awaited those who traversed the stars, side by side, with hearts open and wonder-filled. Write about their species The species to which Zog and Euyue belonged was known as the Asteropians, a name that echoed their celestial origins and mirrored their ability to thrive across the vast canvas of the universe. Asteropians were gelatinous in nature, with bodies composed of an extraordinary organic compound that granted them a host of remarkable qualities. Physiologically, Asteropians were unique. They lacked a solid skeletal structure, allowing them to contort and reshape their forms to an extraordinary degree. Each Asteropian’s body was translucent, emanating soft light in various hues that indicated their mood and health. Zog’s green luminescence and Euyue’s pink radiance were distinctive examples of their species’ colorful array. An Asteropian’s tentacles, which could number anywhere from a handful to a dozen or more depending on the individual, were versatile appendages used for manipulation, locomotion, and interaction with their environment. Asteropians had extraordinary lifespans, often living for several centuries, a longevity that allowed them to amass vast knowledge and experience. This was complemented by their remarkable intelligence, a trait that made them natural explorers and scholars, driven by a deep-seated curiosity and a desire to understand the complexities of the cosmos. Socially, Asteropians were a tight-knit community, valuing strong familial bonds and collaboration. Their society was built upon mutual respect and the sharing of wisdom. Encouraging one another’s pursuits in the sciences, arts, and exploration was embedded in their culture. They communicated through a combination of bioluminescent signaling and a complex series of vibratory sounds, creating a language as beautiful as it was intricate. Their home planet was an oasis of tranquility, with sprawling metropolises that harmoniously blended with the natural landscape. Architectural structures were made from durable yet flexible materials, allowing buildings to sway and pulsate with the planet’s subtle rhythms. These living edifices were a testament to the Asteropians’ advanced understanding of sustainable, organic engineering. The Asteropians were pacifists by nature, devoted to the betterment of not only their own species but also the wider intergalactic community. Their knowledge of both technology and diplomacy was sought after by many other beings, making them excellent mediators in conflicts and esteemed advisors to various galactic councils. Their affinity for nature and all living creatures led them to pursue a symbiotic lifestyle. Their diet consisted of a rich variety of organically farmed algae and plankton, cultivated in the nutrient-rich waters that covered much of their planet. Their agricultural practices were a model of efficiency and environmental stewardship, ensuring that their planet remained pristine. Despite their many commendable traits, Asteropians had their vulnerabilities. Their gelatinous bodies were adapted to a wide range of environments, but extreme temperatures, both hot and cold, could prove hazardous if proper precautions weren’t taken. This innate fragility, however, did little to deter their exploratory zeal—as seen with Zog and Euyue—and only encouraged them to innovate and adapt in the face of adversity. In the grand tapestry of the universe, the Asteropians were a testament to the potential of life to evolve in wondrous and diverse ways, their existence a gentle reminder of both the transience and spectacle of the cosmos. Write a story where they stumble upon a market, Euyue says she tried one thing from her, but it gave her really bad \\"I can't explain\\" (she was very gassy)","completion":"Zog and Euyue’s adventures took them far and wide, their thirst for discovery leading them to a bustling intergalactic market on the planet Torellia. The market was famous throughout the galaxy for its unparalleled selection of exotic goods, rare commodities, and delicacies from thousands of worlds. The siblings were eager to explore the myriad stalls and vendors, each offering treasures and sights unseen. As they meandered through the colorful avenues, they were greeted by the aromas of unfamiliar spices and the cacophony of languages spoken by various alien species. Zog was drawn to a stall selling ancient maps and cosmic artifacts, his eyes twinkling with the prospect of finding new destinations. Euyue, however, was more intrigued by the culinary delights Torellia had to offer. Venturing into the food section of the market, Euyue’s senses were overwhelmed by the diversity of flavors and ingredients on display. Stall after stall showcased dishes that were visually stunning and aromatic. It was a paradise for any epicurean explorer. Amidst the culinary showcase, one particular vendor caught Euyue’s eye, offering a selection of fruits from a remote and uncharted world. The vendor, a gregarious creature with multiple arms and a warm smile, beckoned Euyue closer. \\"Try the Zanthar fruit,\\" the vendor suggested. \\"A delicacy that will dance on your taste buds and leave you wanting more.\\" Curiosity piqued, Euyue couldn’t resist. She took a bite of the Zanthar fruit, its texture unique and flavors an explosion of sweet and sour that enveloped her senses in delight. Thanking the vendor, she moved on, eager to share the experience with Zog. As the siblings reconvened, Zog could tell something was amiss by the slight grimace on Euyue’s face. \\"What’s wrong?\\" he inquired, concern lacing his voice. Euyue squirmed uncomfortably, her usual bright pink hue fluctuating in intensity. \\"I tried something from that stall over there,\\" she gestured subtly, \\"but it gave me really bad... I can’t explain.\\" Euyue's discomfort was apparent, her form expanding and contracting irregularly. Zog, ever the protective brother, placed a tentacle around Euyue, guiding her away from the busy market pathways to a more secluded area. It didn’t take long for Zog to piece together what was happening. The Zanthar fruit, while a delicacy, was notorious for causing digestive tumult in those unaccustomed to its potent effects. Euyue, in her quest for culinary adventure, had become an unwitting victim of its gaseous side effects. Trying to lighten the mood, Zog chuckled softly. \\"Looks like we found out the hard way that Zanthar fruit doesn’t agree with Asteropians,\\" he joked. Euyue managed a sheepish smile, her embarrassment eased by her brother’s understanding and humor. \\"I guess next time, I’ll be a bit more cautious with new foods,\\" she sighed, her spirits lifted despite the discomfort. The siblings decided to cut their visit to the market short, prioritizing Euyue’s well-being over further exploration. As they made their way back to their ship, Euyue leaned on Zog, grateful for his support. The incident at the market became a story they would often recount with laughter in the safety of their explorations. It was a reminder of the unpredictable nature of their adventures and the unexpected lessons learned along the way. And while the Zanthar fruit experience had been less than pleasant, it had only served to strengthen the bond between Zog and Euyue, their shared adventures a testament to their curiosity and resilience in the face of the unknown."},{"prompt":"Write a diary entry from a human who met them, describing their appearance, wobblyness, and their voice","completion":"**Diary Entry: October 17th, 2023** Today was beyond the realm of what I thought possible—an encounter that has fundamentally altered my perception of the universe and our place within it.

They both possess a gelatinous quality, their bodies squishy and translucent, seemingly defying the very laws of biology as I know them. The wobbliness of their movements is something to behold. Each step they take causes their bodies to jiggle and ripple in a manner that one might find comical, yet I found it mesmerizing. As they move, their tentacles— an extension of their remarkable bodies—swing and sway with a grace that contradicts their fluid form. It's like watching water move with purpose, a flowing dance that captivates and intrigues. But perhaps the most remarkable aspect of my encounter with Zog and Euyue was hearing them speak. Their voices are unlike anything I've heard before, a melodic blend of sounds that resonate on a frequency that soothes the soul. It's as if their very words are wrapped in the warmth of the cosmos, managing to sound distinctly alien yet profoundly comforting. They spoke English, but their speech was adorned with harmonics and vibrations that gave their words depth and resonance, turning simple conversation into an auditory experience I long to hear again.

This planet, named Azurea, was renowned across the galaxy for its tranquil shores, crystalline waters, and soft, shimmering sands that seemed to glow under the light of its twin suns. It was the perfect destination for the siblings to unwind and soak up the peaceful ambiance of a natural setting, a contrast to the cold void of space to which they were accustomed. They landed their spacecraft near the coastline, where the sea met the land in gentle caresses, and the horizon stretched into infinity. The beach was deserted, a private paradise where they could relax without the intrusion of the outside world. Zog and Euyue disembarked, excited at the prospect of spending time in such a calming environment. Their gelatinous bodies glimmered in the sunlight, casting colorful reflections on the wet sand as they made their way to the shoreline. Zog's vibrant green hue contrasted beautifully with Euyue's soft pink, their appearances merging with the picturesque surroundings in an almost ethereal manner. The siblings found a spot near the water's edge, where the waves lapped softly at the shore, providing a soothing soundtrack to their afternoon of relaxation. Zog, ever the adventurous spirit, couldn't resist the allure of the water. With a joyful burst of energy, he ventured into the sea, his body wobbling and jiggling with each step. The cool water enveloped him, causing his form to ripple and sway in the gentle currents. He floated effortlessly, enjoying the sensation of weightlessness and the caress of the waves. Euyue, more content to bask in the warmth of the twin suns, stretched out on the sand, allowing her pink form to absorb the radiant heat. The warmth made her body even more pliable and soft, a pleasant sensation that contrasted the usual firmness prompted by cooler environments. She closed her eyes and listened to the harmony of the waves mingled with Zog's joyful exclamations as he played in the water. As the day wore on, the siblings shared stories and laughter, reminiscing about their travels and the myriad worlds they had encountered. They spoke of the beauty they had witnessed, the dangers they had faced, and the countless mysteries that still awaited them in the vast expanse of the universe. In these moments of shared happiness and reflection, they found a profound sense of peace and contentment. As the twin suns began to set, painting the sky in hues of orange, pink, and purple, Zog and Euyue watched the spectacle in silence. The beauty of the sunset, coupled with the tranquility of the beach, reminded them of the simple joys of existence, the pleasures found in moments of quietude and natural splendor. Eventually, the stars began to twinkle in the dusky sky, signaling the end of their day on Azurea. Reluctantly, they rose from their spots, their bodies now cool and firm from the evening air. They made their way back to their spacecraft, their spirits rejuvenated by their time spent on the beach. As Zog and Euyue left Azurea behind, venturing once more into the depths of space, they carried with them the serene memories of their day by the sea. It was a reminder that amidst their endless quest for discovery and adventure, there was always room for moments of relaxation and reflection, a precious opportunity to pause and appreciate the beauty of the universe."},{"prompt":"Write about Azuera","completion":"Azurea, a planet nestled in the tranquil sector of the Orion Spur, is a jewel among the celestial bodies that speckle the Milky Way Galaxy. Uncharted by many and known to only a privileged few, it orbits a binary star system, where twin suns rise and set in harmonious synchrony, painting the sky in a perpetual ballet of light and shadow. The resulting climate is one of mild warmth and gentle breezes, creating an environment that's both invigorating and soothing to the soul. The planet's surface is graced with stunning, diverse biomes, each offering its own unique beauty and challenges. However, it's the beaches of Azurea that have become the stuff of legend among interstellar travelers. Stretching for thousands of kilometers, these shores are composed of fine, bioluminescent sand that glimmers underfoot, a result of the unique, crystalline minerals found in the local geology. By day, the sands shimmer with a soft, inviting glow, and by night, they light up the shorelines with a magical, ethereal beauty that mirrors the star-studded skies above.

The siblings, ever in search of new wonders and phenomena to witness, found themselves drawn to a sector of space marked by tales of a planet unlike any other—a world of bubbling mud pots and gentle, simmering volcanoes. This planet, named Mudara by the few galactic cartographers who'd charted its surface, was said to be a geological marvel, a testament to the universe's capacity for creativity. As *The Odyssey Prism* orbited Mudara, the siblings gazed upon its surface with wide, shimmering eyes. The planet was a palette of earthy reds, ochers, and deep browns, interspersed with the steaming whites and grays of its many geothermal features. It was, as the tales had promised, a world alive with motion—a planet-sized cauldron stirring with the universe’s unseen hand. With a shared nod, Zog and Euyue prepared their descent. Their ship gently touched down on a stable plateau overlooking a field of boiling mud pots. The ground underfoot was firm, though warm to the touch, and the air was thick with steam and the scent of minerals. It was as if the planet breathed through its pores, exhaling the earth’s heated breath. Eager to explore, Zog extended his tentacles, prodding the ground for stability as they ventured towards the nearest mud pot. The ground around it gurgled and popped, a thick, viscous mud bubbling with a life of its own. Fascinated, Zog reached out to touch the mud, only to retract his tentacle swiftly, reminded of the need for caution in unknown environments. Euyue, her interest piqued by the simmering volcanoes on the horizon, suggested they venture closer to these natural cauldrons. The siblings observed from a safe distance as lava gently flowed from a volcanic vent, the molten rock glowing with a mesmerizing, fiery light. It was a quiet display of power, a subdued might that spoke volumes of the planet’s turbulent heart. As they explored, the siblings uncovered Mudara’s secrets. Among the mud pots and lava flows were crystal formations, their structures shaped by eons of geothermal activity. Some crystals were as clear as the finest glass, while others bore the vibrant hues of the mud and rock around them. Zog and Euyue collected samples, their scientific minds eager to study these natural wonders further. Their exploration took an unexpected turn when they stumbled upon signs of life—a series of rudimentary structures crafted from the volcanic rock itself. It appeared Mudara was not as uninhabited as they had assumed. The siblings proceeded with caution, their curiosity now mixed with a respectful awareness of their potential to disturb. Their caution was rewarded when they encountered the architects of these structures—a species adapted to Mudara’s harsh conditions. These beings, with their hard, rock-like exteriors, communicated with the siblings through vibrations in the ground. They shared stories of their planet, their culture intricately tied to the geothermal activity that both shaped their world and sustained it. Zog and Euyue, in turn, shared tales of their own travels, of the ice moons of Zelion and the crystal forests of Farithia. A bond formed, one born of shared knowledge and mutual respect. The siblings learned that even on a planet as seemingly hostile as Mudara, life not only endured but thrived, finding harmony within the tumult. As the time came to depart, Zog and Euyue bid farewell to their new friends, their minds abuzz with the day’s discoveries. Mudara, with its mud pots and volcanoes, had offered them a glimpse into the resilience of life and the myriad forms it could take. Back aboard *The Odyssey Prism*, the siblings set course for new horizons, their spirits enriched by the understanding that in the vast embrace of the cosmos, wonders awaited at every turn—each one a story, a lesson, a moment of connection with the universe’s endless marvels."},{"prompt":"Write a follow up where they scour the planet looking for locals","completion":"After their initial discovery of life on Mudara, Zog and Euyue found themselves filled with an insatiable curiosity about the planet’s inhabitants. The siblings understood that to truly comprehend the essence of Mudara, they had to immerse themselves further into its culture, its people, and the ways in which life had adapted to such a unique environment. This quest for deeper understanding fueled the next leg of their journey as they endeavored to scour the planet, seeking further encounters with its locals. Their exploration began at dawn, the rising twin suns casting long shadows over the bubbling landscape. The siblings decided to split up to cover more ground, each taking a communicator to stay in touch. Zog ventured towards an expansive basin filled with steaming geysers, while Euyue set her sights on a vast volcanic plain dotted with natural hot springs. Zog tread carefully among the geysers, marveling at the power beneath Mudara's crust. It wasn’t long before he noticed a series of intricate carvings on some of the rocks marking the geyser fields. The carvings depicted various forms of life coexisting with the geothermal features—a testament to the locals’ reverence for their planet’s volatile nature. Following these carvings like breadcrumbs, Zog stumbled upon a group of Mudara's indigenous people. They were engaged in what appeared to be a ritual, offering minerals to a particularly active geyser, their bodies vibrating in harmony with the ground beneath them. Euyue’s journey across the volcanic plains proved to be equally enlightening. The hot springs she explored were teeming with microscopic life that thrived in the extreme heat, a vibrant ecosystem that flourished in conditions that would be lethal to many. As she moved further into the plain, she encountered a small community. These locals used the natural heat of the hot springs to cultivate a type of heat-resistant algae, which served as their main food source. Euyue was invited to sample some of the algae, which had a surprisingly complex flavor profile. Both Zog and Euyue were amazed at the locals' ingenuity and their symbiotic relationship with their environment. They learned that the inhabitants of Mudara had developed a way of life that not only respected the planet’s geothermal activity but also revered it as a source of life and energy. This relationship was deeply embedded in their culture, evident in their rituals, their art, and their daily lives. As the day came to a close, the siblings reunited, eager to share their experiences. They recounted tales of ritualistic offerings, of communities thriving in harmony with the land, and of a planet that, despite its harsh exterior, was teeming with life and warmth. Their exploration had revealed the depth of connection between Mudara’s inhabitants and their world, a testament to the resilience and adaptability of life. Inspired by the day’s discoveries, Zog and Euyue decided to spend a few more days on Mudara, documenting their findings and learning as much as they could from the locals. They participated in rituals, helped tend to the heat-resistant algae farms, and even shared knowledge from their own travels across the galaxy. Their time on Mudara deepened their understanding of the intricate web of life that spanned the cosmos, a lesson in the importance of balance, respect, and coexistence. As they bid farewell to their new friends and set off towards their next adventure, Zog and Euyue carried with them not only the scientific knowledge they had gained but also a profound appreciation for the ways in which life adapts and thrives, even in the most unexpected places. The planet of Mudara, with its mud pots and volcanoes, had been a challenging world to understand, but it had offered them insights into the enduring spirit of life—lessons they would carry with them across the stars."},{"prompt":"You are a Turk.

Thalassar is a world as mysterious as it is mesmerizing, a planet utterly unlike Earth, chiefly known for its vast landscapes of bubbling mud pots that stretch across its horizon like a sea of murmuring voices. The planet orbits a distant star, its skies forever painted in hues of twilight due to the peculiar light it receives, casting long shadows over the bubbling terrain. This unique phenomenon makes Thalassar a subject of fascination for interstellar explorers and the focal point of many travelers seeking to unravel the mysteries of the universe. The bubbling mud pots of Thalassar are not merely geological features. They are the beating heart of the planet, each bubble forming with a pop that whispers the age-old secrets of the cosmos. The mud is of various colors, from deep blues to vibrant reds, each hue telling a different story of the planet's complex chemical compositions and atmospheric conditions. These mud pots are known to release gases, crafting an atmospheric tapestry that is both beautiful and scientifically intriguing. Mysteries abound on Thalassar, as ancient as the universe itself. Among these is the Legend of the Lumina Spheres, orbs of light said to emerge from the mud pots during the planet's rare alignment with its three moons. Legends say these spheres possess the knowledge of the cosmos, sought after by many but understood by few. Inhabitants of Thalassar, the Thalassarians, have built their civilization around the bubbling mud pots, considering them sacred. These beings are ethereal, their forms fluid like the mud they revere. The Thalassarians have learned to harness the energy of the mud pots, using it to power their cities and fuel their technology. They live in harmony with their planet, understanding its ebbs and flows, its moods and rhythms. Once every cycle, marked by the blossoming of the silvery Voxis flowers that grow only around the mud pots, the Thalassarians hold a festival to honor the heart of their world. The festival is a spectacle of light and sound, with music that resonates through the ground and into the hearts of all who attend. It's during this time that the Lumina Spheres are most likely to appear, dancing above the bubbling mud, in a ballet of light that bridges the gap between science and magic. But Thalassar holds a warning for those who seek to exploit its beauty. The planet's delicate balance is maintained by the respect and understanding between the Thalassarians and their environment. Visitors come and go, but the memory of Thalassar's bubbling mud pots remains with them, a reminder of the planet's fragile power and the importance of living in harmony with the cosmos. So, while Thalassar continues its endless orbit, a beacon of mystery in the ink-black ocean of space, it also serves as a symbol. It's a reminder that in the heart of the bubbling mud, amidst the secrets and the whispers, lies the potential for understanding, respect, and unity not just with our planet but with the universe at large. Thalassar, with its bubbling mud pots, is more than just a marvel of nature; it's a testament to the symbiotic relationship between all things, a planet that embodies the very essence of life's interconnectedness."},{"prompt":"Test","completion":"Hello!

Ist in 19 Tagen.","completion":"Die Entscheidung, ob man vor einem Bitcoin Halving investieren sollte, hängt von mehreren Faktoren ab, darunter die Marktdynamik, die langfristigen Anlageziele und das Verständnis dafür, was das Halving bedeutet. Hier sind einige Punkte, die sowohl dafür als auch dagegen sprechen, vor einem Bitcoin Halving zu investieren: **Dafür:** 1. **Historische Preisanstiege:** In der Vergangenheit haben die Bitcoin Halvings oft zu signifikanten Preiserhöhungen geführt. Viele Investoren sehen das Halving als einen bullishen Katalysator, da die reduzierten Blockbelohnungen die Neuproduktion von Bitcoin verringern und bei gleichbleibender oder steigender Nachfrage den Preis theoretisch in die Höhe treiben können. 2. **Reduzierte Inflation:** Die Halbierung der Blockbelohnung bedeutet, dass weniger neue Bitcoins in Umlauf kommen, wodurch die Inflationsrate von Bitcoin sinkt. Langfristig orientierte Investoren könnten dies als positiv ansehen, da es das Angebot einschränkt. 3. **Mediale Aufmerksamkeit:** Das Halving zieht zusätzliche mediale Aufmerksamkeit auf sich, was neue Investoren anlocken und die Nachfrage steigern kann. Dies kann kurzfristig zu positiven Preisbewegungen führen. **Dagegen:** 1. **Eingepreiste Erwartungen:** Es ist möglich, dass die Auswirkungen des Halvings bereits im Preis von Bitcoin enthalten sind, da der Krypto-Markt die Information antizipiert und in die Preise einfließt. Dies bedeutet, dass die tatsächliche Veranstaltung keine großen Preisbewegungen auslöst. 2. **Marktvolatilität:** Krypto-Währungen, einschließlich Bitcoin, sind für ihre hohe Volatilität bekannt. Ein Investment kurz vor dem Halving birgt das Risiko, dass der Markt stark schwankt und Investoren einem erhöhten Verlustrisiko ausgesetzt sind. 3. **Unvorhergesehene Ereignisse:** Externe Faktoren, wie regulatorische Änderungen, geopolitische Ereignisse oder Änderungen in der globalen Wirtschaft, können den erwarteten Effekt des Halvings überlagern. Zusammengefasst ist es wichtig, dass man seine Investitionsentscheidung auf umfassender Recherche basiert und das eigene Risikoprofil berücksichtigt. Darüber hinaus sollte man sich nicht ausschließlich auf historische Muster verlassen, da der Kryptomarkt sehr dynamisch ist und von vielen unterschiedlichen Faktoren beeinflusst werden kann. Es kann auch ratsam sein, eine Strategie des langfristigen Haltens („Hodl“) zu verfolgen, anstatt auf kurzfristige Gewinne abzuzielen, besonders wenn man von den Grundlagen und dem langfristigen Potenzial von Bitcoin überzeugt ist."},{"prompt":"Write a chemistry project on the elemental composition of living matter","completion":"# Chemistry Project: Elemental Composition of Living Matter Introduction The complexity of life on Earth is largely a tale of biochemical intricacies, woven together through the combination of various elements.

Here are several steps and checks to ensure everything is correctly set up and to help troubleshoot this issue: # 1. Verify Input Bindings - First, ensure that the input bindings are correctly set up in your project. Go to your \`game.project\` file and check the input section to see if the input bindings file (usually \`input.gamepads\` or \`input.keys\`) is correctly linked. - Then, open your input bindings file and make sure you have your actions defined there (e.g., \`jump\`, \`move_right\`, etc.), along with the associated keys or gamepad inputs. # 2. Check Script Setup In your script where you are handling input, ensure that you have registered the script to receive input callbacks. This is done by including the \`on_input\` function in your script as follows: \`\`\`lua function on_input(self, action_id, action) if action_id == hash(\\"your_action_name_here\\") and action.pressed then -- handle action end end \`\`\` Make sure the action names you are checking against (\`\\"your_action_name_here\\"\`) exactly match those defined in your input bindings, remembering these are case-sensitive. # 3. Ensure The Script Receives Input To make sure your script can actually receive input, you need to enable it either through the editor or programmatically. If it's a GUI script, for instance, make sure \`Acquire Input Focus\` is checked in the properties of the GUI component. For game objects, you need to explicitly acquire input focus in the script like so: \`\`\`lua function init(self) msg.post(\\".\\", \\"acquire_input_focus\\") -- This acquires input focus for the script end \`\`\` # 4. Check Game Object/Component Names If you are handling input in a game object that is instantiated dynamically or at runtime, ensure that the game object name does not conflict with others, and that the right script component is being targeted when acquiring input focus. # 5. Debugging If after these checks you still face issues, insert debug printing in your \`on_input\` function to print out the \`action_id\` and see what you're receiving: \`\`\`lua print(action_id) \`\`\` or \`\`\`lua print(hash_to_hex(action_id)) \`\`\` This will help you verify what action IDs are being registered during input. # Conclusion Following these steps will generally solve most issues related to \`action_id\` always being \`unknown\`. If you've checked all the above and the issue persists, it's possible there might be a deeper issue at play, possibly a bug in the engine (though this is rare) or a very project-specific setup issue. In such a case, consider reaching out to the Defold community for more direct support."},{"prompt":"as I said before, print(action_id) always \\"unknown\\"","completion":"If \`print(action_id)\` is consistently resulting in \`\\"unknown\\"\` despite taking all the correct steps to set up your input handling in Defold, it might point to a less common issue or misunderstanding. Here are some additional considerations and troubleshooting steps: # 1. Understanding \`action_id\` First, it's important to clarify that \`action_id\` in the \`on_input\` function represents the hashed name of an input action as defined in your input bindings file. An \`action_id\` of \`hash(\\"unknown\\")\` is not expected under normal circumstances if your input bindings are correctly set up and matched in your script. # 2. Potential Causes and Solutions Incorrect Input Binding Reference Ensure your game object or GUI component is correctly referencing the intended input bindings file. In Defold, multiple input bindings files can coexist for different game objects or scenes. Each game object or GUI component needs to correctly reference its specific input bindings file under its properties. Default Input Binding Behavior Consider whether the input you're testing with is correctly defined in your input bindings file. An \`action_id\` might be registered as \`hash(\\"unknown\\")\` if Defold does not recognize the input, implying it's either not defined in your input bindings or there's a discrepancy between how it's defined and how you're attempting to use it. Script Issues Double-check that your script is correctly set up for input handling. Particularly, ensure that \`on_input\` is correctly spelled, and it's actually being called. A typo here could cause unexpected behavior. Remember, \`on_input\` should look something like this: \`\`\`lua function on_input(self, action_id, action) if action_id == hash(\\"your_action_name\\") and action.pressed then print(\\"Action detected\\") end end \`\`\` Conflicting Scripts or Components If you have multiple scripts or components trying to handle input simultaneously, there might be conflicts or overrides happening. Ensure each script/component that needs to receive input has correctly called \`msg.post(\\".\\", \\"acquire_input_focus\\")\` in its \`init\` function and that there aren’t any conflicts in input focus handling among components. # 3. Debugging Tips - **Use \`print\` Statements Liberally:** Apart from printing \`action_id\`, also print out \`action.pressed\`, \`action.released\`, and \`action.value\` to get a fuller picture of what the engine is processing. - **Check the Input Binding in Project Settings Again:** It's worth double-checking your project settings to ensure the input bindings file is correctly linked and not accidentally overwritten or disconnected. - **Hardcoded Hash Values:** As a last resort for testing, you can temporarily use hardcoded hash values of your action names in your script to directly compare against \`action_id\`. This is to prevent any potential issues from incorrect hashing or referencing. \`\`\`lua if action_id == hash(\\"jump\\") then print(\\"Jump action\\") end \`\`\` Replace \`\\"jump\\"\` with your actual action name defined in your input bindings. # 4. Community Resources If you have gone through all these steps and the issue persists, it may be helpful to consult the Defold community forums or the official Defold Discord server. The community can be incredibly helpful, and often, issues like these have been solved before by someone else. Remember, the precise use of \`hash\` and matching these hashes exactly as they are defined in your input bindings file is crucial. Any discrepancy here could lead to the issue you're experiencing."},{"prompt":"Сократи этот текст, но самую основную суть оставь.","completion":"Конечно, отправьте текст для сокращения."},{"prompt":"My house was a very popular place in my old neighbourhood. Kids used to hang out there. Kids of all descriptions liked the abundance of videogames and good snack food. There was a little girl, about five, who lived a few blocks away, and she was a lovely child. She had beautiful dark ebony skin, doe eyes, a sweet disposition and a mischievous smile. One day she commandeered me to colour in a colouring book with her. She was colouring in people, giving them names of people she knew. I pointed out that she had coloured in about every person we knew but not one representing herself. She said she wouldn't do that because she was \\"black and ugly.\\" She started to cry, and I told her she was very beautiful, that I didn't feel ugly, and I was black, too. She looked at me as if I was crazy and said, \\"but you're a light colour.\\" I rightly felt obtuse and insensitive. I persisted that she should see how beautiful she really was, and we talked and started to cheer up and laugh, but I know deep down the remnants of those feelings held onto her little heart. She was only five years old, but she already knew she couldn't (and shouldn't) identify with me. I can imagine that, over time, people will continue to tell her that she and mixed people are the same and she may grow to be either more self- loathing or to hate mixed people instead. Neither is a very healthy option. After being told all her life that she and people who are actually mixed-race are the same, genetically, she can't help growing up thinking there is something wrong with somebody. This is not an exclusively black issue either. Misidentification abounds in our race-obsessed society, Groups that have distinct phenotypic differences seek a single prized social classification, white. Some are phenotypic blends as well, in other words are very mixed. Some are not. Take the example of a dark-featured woman of North African extraction I used to know. In order to satisfy her Northern European classification, she dyed her black hair light blonde, leaving it the consistency of candy floss while trying various unnatural looking contact lens colours to lighten her eye colour. Christie Brinkley was her idol. The damage to her psyche was much deeper than the damage to her hair and always evident. Somewhere down the line society implied that she and Christie Brinkley are in the same ethnic (white) pool. So she tried to live up to it. Yes, I am aware there are people of North African heritage who have blonde hair and blue eyes. There are also Sub-Saharan Africans who are of Semitic blood. She was neither, and she was oblivious to other similarly endowed women who wore their dark good looks with style. Once, she even criticized my purchase of a dark featured doll for my niece because it had brown hair, brown eyes and olive skin. It floored her that I had not chosen a white, blonde doll. \\"Why would anyone not want a blonde doll?\\" She was bigoted against her own heredity. People who perpetuate the idea that individuals are full members of ethnic groups they don't fit into are being, perhaps through unintentional thoughtlessness, cruel. They choose to ignore the damage their personal agendas can inflict upon the sense of self and family circumstances of others. While it is painfully obvious that such monoracial preaching purists have no respect for the turmoil of the multiracial individual, they also ignore the harm done to the identity of the single-race, or ethnic person. Advocates of the \\"one drop\\" theory (one drop of black, or Asian or whatever \\"blood\\" makes you only that) have only personal interest at heart in the imposition of false identities. We can divide these reasons into political and/or social ones. What it boils down to is that they are getting something from enforcing monoracial doctrine. These ideas have hurt more people than they have ever helped, and there are those who don't wish to see the world ever take steps to move beyond them. Their purposes are not served if the concept of race, which stands on dubious scientific footing at best, is eliminated. Clinging to these outmoded racial distinctions maintains the evil associated with their imposition. Whether it's avoiding the disapproval of older family members who hold on to the \\"one drop\\" theory of racial identity due to past (bad) experience, getting a congressional district apportioned as you please, or gaining a social distinction from being the \\"lightest\\" people in the room, it is imposing lies, misery and a low self image on countless others. You don't have to be exactly the same as somebody else to love them. None of us is exactly the same as any other person, and most of us are blends of different ethnic groups, truth be told. Accepting this reality is the only way to prevent the imposition of the ideas of arbitrary, \\"desirable\\" racial characteristics upon even the youngest children. Categorizing people into hypothetical races and then trying to squeeze people who are products of the intermingling of two or more of these bogus identifiers into the moulds, underscores the weirdness of the whole idea of racial constructs. Perhaps, worst of all, it instils a sense of \\"I SHOULD look a certain way\\" in children, and then it makes it worse by including people in the child's racial grouping who have only some (or even none) of the external characteristics of that grouping. It makes beautiful children believe they should be something they can never be, because other people in their race are those things. If we can't understand this and understand each other, we, as a society, have no future worth aspiring to.","completion":"Мой дом был популярным местом сбора детей района благодаря видеоиграм и закускам. Однажды, маленькая девочка, проживающая поблизости, расстроилась, когда я заметил отсутствие персонажа, похожего на неё, в её рисунке. Она считала себя \\"черной и уродливой\\". Я постарался убедить её в её красоте, вспоминая о собственном опыте как о человеке с темной кожей, но она сомневалась, ведь мой цвет кожи был светлее. Этот разговор поднял ей настроение, но я чувствовал, что комплексы остались у неё в сердце. В нашем обществе, одержимом расовыми вопросами, часто возникают случаи неверного самоидентификации. Например, женщина североафриканского происхождения, стремясь соответствовать \\"европейским\\" стандартам, изменила свой внешний вид до неузнаваемости, что нанесло ущерб не только её внешности, но и психике. Люди, поддерживающие идею \\"одной капли крови\\", игнорируют ущерб, который они наносят чувству самоидентификации людей, вынуждая их принимать чужую идентичность ради личных или политических выгод. Важно признать, что большинство из нас - это смесь разных этнических групп, и только принимая эту реальность, мы можем избежать навязывания детям арбитражных и \\"желаемых\\" расовых характеристик. Категоризация людей по фиктивным расам вредит восприятию самого себя даже у детей, заставляя их стремиться к недостижимым идеалам. Для здорового общества важно отказаться от устаревших расовых различий и стремиться к взаимопониманию."},{"prompt":"Выразить мнение по следующему тексту: Что значит «выйти за пределы»? Это означает, что вы зашли слишком далеко — непреднамеренно вышли за допустимые рамки. В повседневной жизни мы каждый день выходим за какие-нибудь пределы. Если слишком резко встать со стула, можно потерять равновесие. Если резко отвернуть горячий кран в душевой, можно обжечься. На обледенелом шоссе автомобиль может проскочить на запрещающий сигнал светофора. На вечеринке можно перебрать с алкоголем и выпить больше, чем организм способен спокойно перенести, и тогда утром вы будете мучиться от похмелья. Строительные компании порой строят больше домов, чем люди в состоянии купить, и тогда приходится продавать жилье по заниженным ценам и рисковать банкротством. Часто на воду спускают слишком много рыболовецких судов, и тогда флот становится таким большим, что улов превышает допустимые пределы. Популяция рыбы не может восстановиться, рыбные ресурсы истощаются, и тогда флоту не останется ничего другого, кроме как стоять в гавани. Химические компании навыпускали столько хлорсодержащей продукции, что верхние слои атмосферы не в состоянии с этим справиться. И теперь целыми десяти летиями озоновый слой будет истощенным, пока количество страто сферного хлора не уменьшится. Существует три основных причины выхода за пределы, и они всегда одни и те же, независимо от масштаба явления — от личного уровня до планетарного. Во-первых, это рост (причем порой ускоряющийся) и слишком быстрые изменения. Во-вторых, всегда существует некий предел или ограничение, за которыми деятельность системы перестает быть безопасной. В-третьих, часто между событием и откликом на него бывает запаздывание, вдобавок не всегда этот отклик интерпретируется правильно, так, чтобы вернуть систему в допустимые пределы. Эти три причины — необходимые и достаточные условия для выхода за пределы. Выход за пределы встречается буквально везде и принимает самые разные формы. Это явление может быть физическим, например, рост потребления нефти. Оно может быть организационным, например, уве личение числа подчиненных. Оно может быть психологическим: при страстие к постоянному увеличению личного потребления. Оно может происходить в финансовой сфере, на политической арене, в биологических системах — в любой области нашей жизни. Так же разнообразны могут быть и пределы. Это могут быть ограни ченность пространства, времени, устойчивость системы к нагрузкам физическим, биологическим, политическим, физиологическим и прочим. Наконец, и запаздывания тоже возможны разные. Они могут быть следствием невнимательности, недостоверности данных, задержки информации, медленной реакции, неповоротливости или коррумпиро ванности бюрократического аппарата, ложной теории об откликах системы или просто инерции. Например, водитель, несущийся сломя голову по обледенелой дороге, явно не учитывает, что тормозной путь будет длиннее, чем обычно. Строители используют в обоснованиях своих проектов текущие цены, хотя на рынке построенное жилье появится двумя или тремя годами позже. Рыболовецкий флот наращивает свои мощности на основе прошлого улова, а не на данных о будущем воспроизводстве рыбных ресурсов. Химические соединения могут годами перемещаться в окружающей среде от места их использования до точки, где их присутствие вызовет тяжелые последствия. Многие случаи выхода за пределы не приносят большого вреда. Опыт в этой области, накопленный каждым из нас, позволяет избежать тяжелых последствий. Немало пределов встречается достаточно часто для того, чтобы к тому моменту, когда это станет действительно опасным, мы уже знали, как избежать проблем или хотя бы минимизировать ущерб. Например, перед тем как встать под сильную струю душа, мы пробуем температуру воды рукой. Порой бывает так, что вред нанесен, но быстро компенсируется: перебрав накануне в баре, утром мы поспим подольше и снова будем в полном порядке.Однако иногда существует риск выхода за пределы уже с катастрофи ческими последствиями. Рост населения земного шара и физического капитала толкают человечество к краю пропасти. Наша книга именно об этом. В ней мы постараемся преодолеть сложности в понимании и описании причин и следствий роста населения и капитала и их выхода за пределы самоподцержания Земли. Эти процессы сложны и многогранны. Надежных данных часто недостаточно, они могут быть неточными или неполными. Уровень развития науки пока не позволил достичь согласия даже ученым, что уж говорить о политиках. Тем не менее нам нужен показатель, который может отразить зависимость между запросами человечества в глобальном масштабе и тем, что физически может предоставить нам планета. Этот показатель мы будем называть нагрузкой на окружающую среду, или экологической нагрузкой. Данный показатель использовали в своем исследовании Матис Ва кернагель (Mathis Wackemagel) с коллегами — их доклад был представлен на Всемирном совете в 1997 г. Вакернагель рассчитал размеры территории, которая нужна для того, чтобы обеспечить человечество всеми не обходимыми ресурсами и при этом справиться со всеми выбросами и от ходами1 . Предложенный Вакернагелем показатель и математические ме тоды затем взял на вооружение Всемирный фонд защиты природы (World Wide Fund for Nature), который теперь каждые полшда публикует данные по экологической нагрузке более чем для 150 стран в своем «Отчете о жи вой планете» (Living Planet Report)2 . По этим данным получается, что с 80- х гг XX в. население планеты каждый год использует больше ресурсов, чем может быть восстановлено за тот же период. Другими словами, экологическая нагрузка мирового сообщества на внешнюю среду превы шает ее способность восстанавливаться. Это заключение подкрепляется огромным объемом данных, и мы вернемся к этому вопросу в гл. 3. Потенциальные последствия такого выхода за пределы чрезвычайно опасны. Эта ситуация уникальна: перед человечеством встают проблемы, которые раньше никогда не встречались в таких масштабах. Чтобы справиться с ними, не хватает ни умения рассчитывать на годы вперед, ни культурных традиций, ни нужных привычек, ни соответствующих организаций. На устранение последствий выхода за пределы потребуются сотни, а то и тысячи лет. Однако эти последствия не обязательно должны быть катастрофиче скими. Выход за пределы может вести человечество по двум возможным путям. Первый из них — крах в той или иной степени. Второй - осознан ный поворот, коррекция, осторожное смягчение напряженности. Мы рассматриваем оба варианта, их влияние на человеческое общество и со стояние планеты. Мы верим в то, что второй вариант — коррекция — воз можен, и что он способен привести к желаемому будущему для всех людей мира, устойчивому, справедливому и обеспеченному. Мы уверены и в том, что если не произвести серьезную коррекцию в самое ближайшее время, то крах в той или иной форме будет неизбежен. И наступит он еще при жизни сегодняшнего поколения. Это заявление чудовищно. Как же мы пришли к нему? За прошедшие 30 лет мы и многие наши коллеги работали над анализом долговременных причин и следствий роста численности населения и вызванной этим экологической нагрузки. Мы использовали четыре разных подхода, можно сказать, четыре увеличивающих прибора разной кратности, позволяющих взглянуть на мир с разных точек зрения, подобно тому как линзы микроскопа и телескопа позволяют увидеть разные картины. Три из них широко известны, их легко описать: (1) стандартная научно-экономическая теория глобальной системы, (2) статистические данные по окружающей среде и мировым ресурсам и (3) компьютерная модель, позволяющая обобщить всю информацию и сделать выводы. Большая часть этой книги построена на этих трех подходах: мы рассказываем, как мы применили их и что это нам дало. Четвертый подход - это наше мировоззрение, наша личная позиция, наши ценности — основа нашего взгляда на окружающую действитель ность. Каждый по-своему воспринимает мир; от внутренних убеждений человека зависит, что он видит, а что нет — это своеобразный фильтр. Ту информацию об окружающем мире, которая соотносится с внутренними (часто подсознательными) убеждениями или ожиданиями, человек вос принимает легко. Если же информация не соответствует ожиданиям, че ловек склонен пренебрегать ею; он ей не доверяет или прямо отрицает ее. Когда человек смотрит через фильтр, словно через цветное стекло, он видит сквозь стекло, но при этом не видит самого стекла. То же самое происходит с мировоззрением. Если человек разделяет ваше мировоз зрение, нет никакой нужды описывать это мировоззрение, он и так на вашей стороне. Если же нет, то объяснить ему вашу позицию очень слож но. Всегда нужно помнить, что любая книга, компьютерная модель или официальное заявление построены на мировоззрении их авторов в не меньшей степени, чем на «объективных данных» или анализе. Никто не может полностью абстрагироваться от своего мировоззрения, и мы не исключение. Но зато мы можем донести до читателя его ключевые положения. Наше мировоззрение сформировалось под влиянием западного индустриального общества, в котором мы выросли, под влиянием научно экономических исследований, поездок по всему миру и уроков, которые мы из этого вынесли. Самая важная составляющая нашего восприятия мира (что, наверное, меньше всего разделяются другие люди) - это взгляд на мир как на систему. Как и всякая точка зрения — например, вершина холма — системный подход позволяет человеку увидеть то, что с других точек зрения увидеть невозможно, но при этом может скрыть от взгляда другие вещи. Он обращает внимание на динамические системы — наборы взаимосвязанных материальных и нематериальных элементов, меняющихся со временем. Он позволяет увидеть мир как совокупность моделей поведения, таких как рост, спад, колебания, выход за пределы. Он позволяет сосредоточиться не на отдельных элементах, а на связях между ними. Мы рассматриваем окружающую среду, экономику и демографию (сколько бы внутренних элементов они ни насчитывали) как единую глобальную систему с огромным числом взаимосвязей. Мы наблюдаем за уровнями, потоками, обратными связями, пороговыми значениями, и все они влияют на поведение системы в будущем и на те меры, которые мы можем предпринять, чтобы изменить его. Структура книги следует логике нашего анализа глобальной системы. Базовые положения мы уже привели. Выход за пределы становится след ствием трех факторов: (1) стремительных изменений, (2) пределов, за ко торые эти изменения не должны выходить, и (3) ошибок либо запазды вания в восприятии этих пределов и в управлении изменениями. Мы рассмотрим состояние глобальной системы в следующем порядке: сначала движущие силы, приводящие к быстрым изменениям в мировом масштабе, затем планетарные пределы и, наконец, способы, с помощью которых человеческое общество в состоянии обнаружить пределы и отреагировать на них.Рост населения и промышленного производства отражается на многих других элементах планетарной системы. Например, растут концентрации различных типов загрязнений. На рис. 1.3 отражен рост атмосферной концентрации основного загрязнителя — диоксида углерода, одного из парниковых газов, появляющегося в результате сжигания ископаемого топлива и сведения лесов.Концентрация диоксида углерода в атмосфере возросла с приблизительно 270 частей на миллион до 370 частей на миллион и продолжает увеличиваться. Основные источники поступления в атмосферу диоксида углерода — сжигание человеком ископаемых видов топлива и сведение лесов. Последствие — глобальное изменение климата. (Источники: UNEP; U.S. DoE.) в этом случае рост продолжается ощутимыми темпами. Зачастую снижение темпа роста не может остановить сам рост, так как даже маленький процент прироста относительно большой базы дает значительное увеличение. Так происходит с восемью из четырнадцати показателей табл. 1.1. За последние полстолетия численность населения возросла многократно; освоенные людьми территории, потоки вещества и энергии увеличились в 2,4,10 раз и больше, и человечество рассчитывает на еще больший рост в будущем. Люди поддерживают идеи роста, поскольку полагают, что это приве дет к повышению их благосостояния. Правительственные чиновники уверены в том, что рост — универсальное средство буквально от любых проблем. В богатых странах считают, что рост необходим для того, чтобы повышались занятость, социальная мобильность, техническая оснащен ность. В бедных странах рост считают единственным средством выхода из нищеты. Многие полагают, что рост необходим, чтобы иметь достаточные ресурсы для защиты окружающей среды. Правительства и руководители корпораций делают все возможное и невозможное для того, чтобы рост продолжался. Все это приводит к тому, что рост воспринимается как нечто позитив ное, желаемое. Вспомните синонимы роста: развитие, прогресс, продви жение, увеличение, достижение, улучшение, процветание, успех...Таковы психологические и организационные движущие силы роста. Есть еще так называемые структурные причины, кроющиеся внутри связей между элементами демографо-экономической системы. В гл. 2 обсу ждаются структурные причины роста и описываются их последствия, чтобы можно было ответить на вопрос: почему рост стал доминирующей характеристикой поведения мировой системы? Рост может решить одни проблемы, но при этом создает другие, поскольку у него есть пределы — это описано в гл. 3. Возможности Земли не безграничны. Рост любого материального показателя, будь то численность населения, число автомобилей, домов и заводов, не может продолжаться бесконечно. Но предельное число людей, машин, зданий и фабрик нельзя рассчитать напрямую — можно только косвенно, через пределы потоков энергии и материалов, необходимых для поддержания жизни этих людей, создания и функционирования этих машин, зданий и фабрик. Это пределы скорости, с которой человечество может извлекать ресурсы (зерновые и кормовые культуры, древесина, рыба) и выбрасывать отходы (парниковые газы, токсичные вещества), не превышая уровня продуктивности среды и ее способности разлагать загрязнения. Население и экономика зависят от потоков воздуха, воды, продо вольствия, сырья и ископаемого топлива на планете. Образующиеся отходы и загрязнения возвращаются назад, в окружающую среду. Источ ники включают в себя сырьевые месторождения, водоносные горизонты, запасы питательных веществ в почве; к стокам относятся атмосфера, поверхностные водоемы и мусорные свалки. Физические пределы роста — это пределы способности планетарных источников предоставлять нам потоки сырья и энергии, а стоков — поглощать загрязнения и отходы. В гл. 3 мы анализируем состояние мировых источников и стоков. Данные, которые мы приводим, образуют классическую пару «плохая новость — хорошая новость».Плохая новость состоит в том, что многие важнейшие источники истощаются и деградируют, а большинство стоков уже переполнено. Потоки, используемые экономической системой в настоящее время, невозможно поддерживать в таких масштабах продолжительное время. Некоторые источники и стоки уже находятся на пределе, их рост уже начинает ограничиваться, например, повышением цен, налогами на выбросы в окружающую среду, наконец, увеличением смертности. Хорошая новость заключается в том, что существующие темпы ис пользования ресурсов вовсе не являются необходимыми для поддержания достойного уровня жизни всех людей на планете. Нагрузку на окружающую среду можно ослабить за счет уменьшения численности населения, изменения норм потребления, применения ресурсосберегающих технологий. Эти изменения вполне возможны. У человечества есть все необходимые знания для того, чтобы поддерживать приемлемый уровень услуг и производства товаров при одновременном существенном снижении нагрузки на планету. В теории существует множество способов вернуть нагрузку на среду со стороны человечества в рамки допустимого. Однако теория не воплощается на практике автоматически. Пока что необходимые изменения, которые могут снизить негативное влияние на окружающую среду, либо совсем не осуществляются, либо проводятся недостаточно быстро, чтобы снять нагрузку с источников и стоков. Про исходит это потому, что не существует прямых и видимых причин, выну ждающих пойти на такие изменения немедленно, а также потому, что это в любом случае потребует много времени. Этому посвящена гл. 4, где обсуждаются тревожные сигналы, предупреждающие человечество о том, что оно вышло за пределы, и скорость, с которой общество может на них реагировать. В гл. 4 мы обратимся к нашей компьютерной модели World3, которая позволит свести воедино множество теорий и статистических данных, чтобы в доступной форме представить картину мира — рост, пределы, за держки отклика... Это инструмент для изучения будущих последствий наших сегодняшних действий. Мы покажем, как компьютер моделирует будущее поведение глобальной системы, исходя из того, что в ней не будет ни радикальных изменений, ни попыток изменить существующие тенденции или решить проблемы, не доводя ситуацию до крайности. Результат такого имитационного моделирования — практически в ка ждом сценарии — выход за пределы, катастрофа мировой экономики и резкое снижение численности населения. К счастью, не все сценарии приводят к катастрофе, есть и исключения. В гл. 5 мы приведем самый наглядный из известных нам примеров того, что человек способен предвидеть развитие событий, обнаружить наличие предела и вовремя отступить. Мы расскажем, как мировое сообщество отреагировало в 80-е гг. XX в. на известие о истощении стратосферного озонового слоя. Этот случай поучителен по двум причинам. Во-первых, он разрушает доминирующее представление о том, что люди, правительства и корпорации не обладают дальновидностью и предусмотрительностью и потому никогда в жизни не смогут договориться и принять совместные меры к решению мировых проблем. Во-вторых, он отлично иллюстрирует все три фактора, необходимых для выхода за пределы: быстрый рост, наличие пределов и задержку реакций (как ученых, так и политиков). История про истощение стратосферного озонового слоя и про меры, принятые человеком, похожа на сказку со счастливым концом, но на самом деле ее финальные страницы будут написаны только через несколько десятилетий. Она служит примером того, как трудно управлять сложной экономикой в рамках еще более сложной, полной взаимосвязей пла нетарной системы, особенно если нет полного понимания сути явления, реакции запаздывают, а система в целом обладает огромной инерцией. В гл. 6 мы используем компьютер по его прямому назначению — не для предсказания того, что произойдет в результате существующей политики, а для анализа вариантов, которые могут стать реальностью, если мы предпримем определенные меры. Мы ввели в модель World3 не которые гипотезы об изобретательности человека и сосредоточились на двух путях решения проблем — рыночном и технологическом, — на кото рые множество людей возлагают большие надежды. Эти два пути так или иначе учтены в модели World3, но в гл. 6 мы обращаем на них особое вни мание. Мы анализируем, что может произойти, если мировое сообщество приложит целенаправленные усилия, чтобы контролировать выбросы загрязнений, обеспечить защиту окружающей среды и здоровья человека, наладить переработку вторичного сырья и добиться гораздо более эф фективного использования доступных ресурсов. Из полученных по модели World3 сценариев мы узнали, что все эти усилия могут оказать помощь существенную, но сами по себе недоста точны. Они не достигают цели, поскольку реакции рынка и технологи ческой сферы не всегда можно правильно интерпретировать, к тому же они поступают с большим запаздыванием. Реализация подобных мер требует времени, денег, потоков сырья и энергии, и их все равно могут свести на нет рост населения и капитала. Чтобы избежать глобальной катастрофы и привести человечество к самоподдержанию, технический прогресс и приспособляемость рынка необходимы, но не достаточны. Нужно что-то еще. Что именно, описывается в гл. 7, где мы используем модель World3","completion":"Данная статья явно говорит о важности осознания и контроля за выходом за пределы в различных областях жизни, начиная от поведенческих аспектов и заканчивая экологическими последствиями действий человека. Важно понимать, что рост не всегда приносит пользу, и что необходимы ограничения и пределы для того, чтобы обеспечить устойчивость и сохранение ресурсов на планете. Также важно понимать, что предотвращение катастроф можно достичь путем изменения норм потребления, применения ресурсосберегающих технологий и снижения численности населения, и что этот путь вполне возможен. Все это требует совместных усилий и правильного понимания ситуации, чтобы избежать тяжелых последствий."},{"prompt":"какие проблемы с управление возникнут если на плохой резине ездить на очень мощной машине? ну, вроде того что на скорости качать трясти начнет, заносить будет очень легко, что при сильном нажатии газа заносит даже не ровном месте.","completion":"Езда на плохой резине на очень мощной машине может привести к следующим проблемам с управлением: 1.

НА АНГЛ","completion":"Could you please provide the text you'd like to be summarized and rewritten in third person?"},{"prompt":"My house was a very popular place in my old neighbourhood. Kids used to hang out there. Kids of all descriptions liked the abundance of videogames and good snack food. There was a little girl, about five, who lived a few blocks away, and she was a lovely child. She had beautiful dark ebony skin, doe eyes, a sweet disposition and a mischievous smile. One day she commandeered me to colour in a colouring book with her. She was colouring in people, giving them names of people she knew. I pointed out that she had coloured in about every person we knew but not one representing herself. She said she wouldn't do that because she was \\"black and ugly.\\" She started to cry, and I told her she was very beautiful, that I didn't feel ugly, and I was black, too. She looked at me as if I was crazy and said, \\"but you're a light colour.\\" I rightly felt obtuse and insensitive. I persisted that she should see how beautiful she really was, and we talked and started to cheer up and laugh, but I know deep down the remnants of those feelings held onto her little heart. She was only five years old, but she already knew she couldn't (and shouldn't) identify with me. I can imagine that, over time, people will continue to tell her that she and mixed people are the same and she may grow to be either more self- loathing or to hate mixed people instead. Neither is a very healthy option. After being told all her life that she and people who are actually mixed-race are the same, genetically, she can't help growing up thinking there is something wrong with somebody. This is not an exclusively black issue either. Misidentification abounds in our race-obsessed society, Groups that have distinct phenotypic differences seek a single prized social classification, white. Some are phenotypic blends as well, in other words are very mixed. Some are not. Take the example of a dark-featured woman of North African extraction I used to know. In order to satisfy her Northern European classification, she dyed her black hair light blonde, leaving it the consistency of candy floss while trying various unnatural looking contact lens colours to lighten her eye colour. Christie Brinkley was her idol. The damage to her psyche was much deeper than the damage to her hair and always evident. Somewhere down the line society implied that she and Christie Brinkley are in the same ethnic (white) pool. So she tried to live up to it. Yes, I am aware there are people of North African heritage who have blonde hair and blue eyes. There are also Sub-Saharan Africans who are of Semitic blood. She was neither, and she was oblivious to other similarly endowed women who wore their dark good looks with style. Once, she even criticized my purchase of a dark featured doll for my niece because it had brown hair, brown eyes and olive skin. It floored her that I had not chosen a white, blonde doll. \\"Why would anyone not want a blonde doll?\\" She was bigoted against her own heredity. People who perpetuate the idea that individuals are full members of ethnic groups they don't fit into are being, perhaps through unintentional thoughtlessness, cruel. They choose to ignore the damage their personal agendas can inflict upon the sense of self and family circumstances of others. While it is painfully obvious that such monoracial preaching purists have no respect for the turmoil of the multiracial individual, they also ignore the harm done to the identity of the single-race, or ethnic person. Advocates of the \\"one drop\\" theory (one drop of black, or Asian or whatever \\"blood\\" makes you only that) have only personal interest at heart in the imposition of false identities. We can divide these reasons into political and/or social ones. What it boils down to is that they are getting something from enforcing monoracial doctrine. These ideas have hurt more people than they have ever helped, and there are those who don't wish to see the world ever take steps to move beyond them. Their purposes are not served if the concept of race, which stands on dubious scientific footing at best, is eliminated. Clinging to these outmoded racial distinctions maintains the evil associated with their imposition. Whether it's avoiding the disapproval of older family members who hold on to the \\"one drop\\" theory of racial identity due to past (bad) experience, getting a congressional district apportioned as you please, or gaining a social distinction from being the \\"lightest\\" people in the room, it is imposing lies, misery and a low self image on countless others. You don't have to be exactly the same as somebody else to love them. None of us is exactly the same as any other person, and most of us are blends of different ethnic groups, truth be told. Accepting this reality is the only way to prevent the imposition of the ideas of arbitrary, \\"desirable\\" racial characteristics upon even the youngest children. Categorizing people into hypothetical races and then trying to squeeze people who are products of the intermingling of two or more of these bogus identifiers into the moulds, underscores the weirdness of the whole idea of racial constructs. Perhaps, worst of all, it instils a sense of \\"I SHOULD look a certain way\\" in children, and then it makes it worse by including people in the child's racial grouping who have only some (or even none) of the external characteristics of that grouping. It makes beautiful children believe they should be something they can never be, because other people in their race are those things. If we can't understand this and understand each other, we, as a society, have no future worth aspiring to.","completion":"The author's house was a favored gathering spot in their previous neighborhood, known for its video games and snacks. Among the visitors was a charming five-year-old girl with dark ebony skin and a sweet nature. One day, while coloring together, the girl expressed sadness about not representing herself in her artwork because she viewed herself as \\"black and ugly.\\" The author, also being black but lighter-skinned, tried to reassure her of her beauty, but the interaction highlighted the girl's deep-seated feelings of inadequacy and the complex issues of racial identity and beauty standards. The narrative expands to discuss how society's obsession with race and the desire for a “white” classification lead to misidentification and self-loathing among individuals with distinct phenotypic features or mixed heritage. This is exemplified by a North African woman the author knew, who went to great lengths to achieve a Northern European appearance, damaging her psyche in the process. The author criticizes the perpetuation of rigid and exclusive racial identities, particularly through the \\"one drop\\" theory, as being cruel and rooted in personal or political agendas. This insistence on monoracial identity causes harm not only to individuals of mixed heritage but also to those who cannot or do not wish to identify with a single race, imposing upon them false identities and low self-esteem. The author advocates for acceptance of the reality that most people are ethnically diverse and that love and acceptance should not be contingent on racial similarity. They argue for moving beyond outdated racial constructs to prevent imposing harmful beauty standards on children, promoting a future where society embraces diversity and mutual understanding."},{"prompt":"скажи, существует ли сейчас расовое неприятие? как с этим бороться?","completion":"Да, расовое неприятие, к сожалению, продолжает существовать во многих частях мира. Оно может проявляться в различных формах, от микроагрессий и предвзятых стереотипов до явной дискриминации и насилия. Борьба с расизмом требует совместных усилий на различных уровнях общества и включает в себя несколько ключевых шагов: 1. **Образование и осведомленность:** Повышение осведомленности о расизме, его истории и том, как он влияет на жизни людей, является критически важным. Образовательные программы могут помочь развенчать мифы и стереотипы, а также научить уважению и признанию многообразия. 2. **Гражданская активность и участие общественности:** Участие в общественных организациях и движениях, направленных на борьбу с расизмом и продвижение равенства, может оказывать значительное влияние. Кампании по освещению вопросов расизма и акции протеста также могут способствовать социальным изменениям. 3. **Политика и законодательство:** Принятие и реализация законов и политик, направленных на борьбу с расовой дискриминацией и защиту прав человека, являются фундаментальными для изменения. Это может включать в себя меры по предотвращению профилирования по признаку расы, обеспечение равного доступа к образованию и трудоустройству, а также наказание за расистские действия. 4. **Саморефлексия и изменение личных взглядов:** На индивидуальном уровне важно осмысливать собственные предубеждения и стереотипы, а также работать над изменением своего поведения и взглядов. Важно стремиться к эмпатии, уважать различия и активно выступать против расизма в повседневной жизни. 5. **Поддержка и солидарность:** Поддержка людей, пострадавших от расизма, и солидарность с ними в борьбе за их права и достоинство способствуют созданию более объединенного и справедливого общества. Отстаивание интересов и предоставление платформ для голосов меньшинств также имеет важное значение. Борьба с расизмом – это непрерывный процесс, требующий постоянных усилий на всех уровнях общества. Только через образование, диалог и коллективные действия можно достичь истинного равенства и устранить расовые предрассудки."},{"prompt":"give 10 good variable names for a function that posts a bunch of posts to create cookies.","completion":"Creating well-named variables is key to writing readable and maintainable code. For a function that posts a bunch of posts to create cookies, the variable names should be descriptive and concise, reflecting their roles within the function. Here are 10 suggestions: 1. \`numberOfPosts\` - Represents the number of posts that the function will process to create cookies. 2. \`postQueue\` - A list or queue that stores the posts awaiting processing. 3. \`cookieData\` - Holds the data or attributes for each cookie to be created from a post. 4. \`postIndex\` - Used as a counter in a loop for processing each post. 5. \`cookieList\` - An array or list where the created cookies are stored. 6. \`postContent\` - Represents the content of a single post being processed. 7. \`creationStatus\` - A boolean or a set of flags indicating the success or failure of cookie creation from a post. 8. \`postToCookieConverter\` - A function or method that converts a post into a cookie. 9. \`maxPostLimit\` - A limit to how many posts can be processed in one function call, to prevent overload. 10. \`cookieExpiry\` - Represents the expiration time or date for the cookies being created. These variable names, when used in the context of a function for posting content and creating cookies, can help make the code more understandable and easier to maintain."},{"prompt":"whats the best variable name for a function that posts a bunch of posts to create cookies.","completion":"When it comes to naming variables or functions, clarity and descriptiveness are key. You want the name to provide a clear indication of what the function does without being overly long or cumbersome. Given your description, the function is intended to post a bunch of posts to create cookies. A good name for such a function would balance descriptiveness with brevity. Here are a few suggestions: 1. \`createCookiesThroughPosts\` 2. \`postForCookieCreation\` 3. \`generateCookiesByPosting\` 4. \`postToCreateCookies\` 5. \`submitPostsForCookies\` Each of these names attempts to directly describe the action (posting) and the purpose or result of the action (creating cookies). If your context or programming language has particular naming conventions, you might prefer one style over another (e.g., camelCase vs. snake_case). Always ensure your naming is consistent with the overall project and understandable by others who might read or work with your code."},{"prompt":"How do I add things installed with npm install (name), like particles.vue3, to be used as vue plugins using Quasar CLI?","completion":"To use a Vue plugin such as \`particles.vue3\` in a Quasar project, you have to follow a few steps. These steps generally involve installing the package via npm, and then explicitly importing and using the plugin within your Quasar project. Here's how you can do it, using the Quasar CLI environment: 1. **Installation**: First, you need to install the \`particles.vue3\` package. Open your terminal and run the following command in your project's root directory: \`\`\` npm install particles.vue3 --save \`\`\` Or if you prefer using \`yarn\`: \`\`\` yarn add particles.vue3 \`\`\` 2. **Importing and Using the Plugin in Quasar**: After installing the package, you would typically import it and then use it within your Quasar application. Since Quasar CLI projects are set up with Vue 3, you should follow the Vue 3 conventions for using a plugin. Quasar CLI projects have a boot feature, which allows you to execute code before your app starts. This is the perfect place to register and configure plugins like \`particles.vue3\`. a. **Create a Boot File**: - First, create a new boot file if you don't already have one for your plugin. You can do this by creating a file named after the plugin in the \`src/boot\` directory, for example, \`particlesVue3.js\`. b. **Configure the Plugin**: - In \`src/boot/particlesVue3.js\`, import VueParticles from \`particles.vue3\` and then use it with the Vue app instance. Here's an example of how the file should look: \`\`\`javascript import { boot } from 'quasar/wrappers' import Particles from \\"particles.vue3\\"; export default boot(({ app }) => { // This is how you tell Vue to use the particles.vue3 plugin app.use(Particles); }); \`\`\` c. **Register the Boot File**: - After creating and configuring your boot file, you need to ensure that Quasar knows to use this file during the boot process. Open \`quasar.conf.js\`, and in the \`boot\` array within the \`framework\` configuration, add your newly created boot file (without the extension). For example: \`\`\`javascript // quasar.conf.js module.exports = function (/* ctx */) { return { // Other configurations... boot: [ 'particlesVue3', // other boot files... ], // rest of the configuration... } } \`\`\` This setup ensures that when your Quasar application starts, it initializes the \`particles.vue3\` plugin and makes it available throughout your application. 3. **Use the Plugin**: Now, you can use \`particles.vue3\` as intended in your components or wherever needed within your Quasar application, following the documentation specific to \`particles.vue3\` for implementation details. Remember to consult the official \`particles.vue3\` documentation for any specific configurations or component usage guidelines that might be required to get the most out of the plugin."},{"prompt":"перепиши на lua \\" angular.module('beamng.apps') .directive('classicSpeedo', [function () { return { template: '<div style=\\"overflow: hidden;\\"><canvas id=\\"cSpeedo\\" height=\\"90px\\"></canvas></div>', replace: true, restrict: 'EA', link: function (scope, element, attrs) { var streams = ['electrics'];

The impact of this act can be significant in several ways: 1. Increased access to higher education: The Student Loan Act will make higher education more accessible to a greater number of students, particularly those from low-income families who may not have the financial means to pay for their education. This will help to bridge the gap in educational opportunities and improve overall educational attainment in the country. 2. Reduction of dropout rates: With the availability of student loans, students who may otherwise have had to drop out of school due to financial constraints will be able to continue their education. This will help to reduce dropout rates and improve student retention in higher education institutions. 3. Empowerment of students: The availability of student loans will empower students to pursue their educational goals and aspirations without being limited by financial constraints. This will equip them with the knowledge and skills needed to succeed in the job market and contribute positively to the economy. 4. Economic development: By investing in higher education through student loans, the government is investing in the future of the country. Educated individuals are more likely to secure better job opportunities, earn higher salaries, and contribute to economic growth and development.

Cette différence pourrait s’expliquer par une variation de la demande, des taxes aéroportuaires différentes, ou encore les distances par rapport aux villes de départ. b. Calcul de l’étendue, la variance, l’écart type ainsi que le coefficient de variation Pour Atlanta et Salt Lake City, l’étendue se calcule en soustrayant le vol le moins cher du plus cher. Pour simplifier, je vous donne directement l’étendue pour chaque destination et des indications sur comment calculer la variance et l’écart type, sans faire tous les calculs exacts ici. Étendue: - Atlanta: (523.60 - 249.60 = 274 ) - Salt Lake City: (618.60 - 159.60 = 459 ) Variance et écart type: Pour calculer la variance, vous devez à chaque fois : 1. Calculer la différence entre chaque valeur et la moyenne. 2. Élever chaque différence au carré. 3. Calculer la moyenne de ces valeurs. Pour l’écart type, prenez la racine carrée de la variance. Les coefficients de variation se calculent ensuite en divisant l’écart type par la moyenne et en multipliant par 100 pour obtenir un pourcentage. Ces mesures vous permettent de comprendre la distribution générale des prix autour de la moyenne. c. Coût médian et modes Pour calculer le médian, organisez les coûts dans un ordre ascendant puis identifiez la valeur centrale. - Pour Atlanta, le médian se situe entre ( (333.60 + 339.60) / 2 = 336.60 ) après arrondi à l’unité supérieure. - Pour Salt Lake City, le médian se situe entre ( (311.60 + 319.60) / 2 = 315.60 ) après arrondi à l’unité supérieure. Le mode est la valeur qui apparaît le plus souvent dans chaque série. Si toutes les valeurs sont uniques, il n’y a pas de mode. d. Graphique approprié Pour visualiser les données, un graphique de boîte (boxplot) pour chaque destination serait idéal pour comparer les coûts.

Quand on parle de calculer la moyenne, en mathématiques, cela signifie qu’on additionne d’abord toutes les valeurs d’un ensemble, puis on divise cette somme par le nombre total de valeurs de cet ensemble. Cela donne la valeur moyenne de cet ensemble. Pour Atlanta: On a une liste de prix de vols aller-retour. Pour trouver la moyenne de ces prix, on additionne d'abord tous les prix, puis on divise le total par le nombre de prix. Voici un exemple simplifié de l'explication précédente avec des notations classiques : Disons que les prix des vols sont (340.10), (354.60), (465.60) et ainsi de suite jusqu'à avoir 14 prix différents. 1. Ajoutez tous ces prix ensemble. La somme de tous ces prix est (4824). 2. Comme il y a 14 prix au total, la moyenne se calcule en divisant (4824) par (14). [ text{Moyenne pour Atlanta} = frac{4824}{14} = 344.57 ] Cela signifie que, en moyenne, le prix d'un vol aller-retour pour Atlanta est de (344.57) dollars. Pour Salt Lake City: Le processus est le même. On a une liste de prix pour les vols aller-retour, et on souhaite calculer la moyenne. 1. On additionne tous les prix donnés pour Salt Lake City, ce qui donne un total de (5322.3). 2. On divise ce total par le nombre de prix, qui est également (14) ici. [ text{Moyenne pour Salt Lake City} = frac{5322.3}{14} = 380.16 ] Donc, la moyenne des prix des vols aller-retour pour Salt Lake City est de (380.16) dollars.

Let's compare the versions from 2003, Fast Forward (a continuation of the 2003 series), the 2012 series, and Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. # Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003) This series, produced by 4Kids Entertainment and Mirage Studios, aired from 2003 to 2009. It aimed to stay more true to the original comic book version by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird, offering a darker and more serious tone compared to the 1987 cartoon. This series focused on the martial arts aspect, the brotherhood of the turtles, and their battles with the Shredder, the Foot Clan, and other villains from the TMNT universe. It was well-received for its faithful adaptation of the source material and its complex storylines. # Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Fast Forward (2006) \\"Fast Forward\\" is technically the sixth season of the 2003 series but takes a significant leap forward (literally) by transporting the turtles to the future (the year 2105), offering a new setting and futuristic challenges. This change was an attempt to refresh the series by introducing new characters, technology, and environments. However, it received mixed reactions from fans, some of whom appreciated the new direction, while others were put off by the dramatic departure from the series' previous tone and setting. # Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2012) Produced by Nickelodeon Animation Studio, this series ran from 2012 to 2017. It blended CGI animation with the TMNT lore, bringing the characters into a modern setting while retaining their unique personalities and martial arts background. This series was notable for its humor, heart, and a mix of dark and light story elements. It incorporated both classic and new villains, explored the origins of the Turtles and Splinter in a fresh way, and introduced a wider universe including aliens and dimensional travel. It struck a balance between appealing to new, younger audiences and longtime fans of the franchise. # Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2018) \\"Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,\\" which aired from 2018 to 2020, took a different approach from its predecessors. This series opted for a more distinct, stylized animation and significantly revamped many key aspects of TMNT lore. It aimed at a younger audience with a greater emphasis on humor and less on the gritty or darker undertones of previous iterations. The Turtles' personalities and abilities were tweaked, and their traditional weapon set was changed. This series also took liberties with the characterization of Splinter and the origins of the Turtles, offering a fresh take on their story. While it was innovative and visually dynamic, it received polarized feedback from TMNT traditionalists and fans of the older series. # Comparison Each series brings something unique to the TMNT universe: - **2003**: Offers a darker, more serious storyline closely aligned with the comics. - **Fast Forward**: Provides a futuristic twist, giving a new but controversial direction. - **2012**: Balances humor, heart, and action in a CGI-animated world, appealing to both new and longtime fans. - **Rise**: Introduces a radically different, stylized approach focusing on lighter, more comedic elements. The evolution of TMNT through these series reflects changing audience preferences and the versatility of the franchise, showcasing its capacity to reinvent itself while still honoring the essence of the beloved Turtle brothers."},{"prompt":"Кто такой Геннадий Горин?","completion":"Геннадий Горин (1930-2000) - советский и российский писатель, автор множества книг для детей и взрослых.

They've \\"introduced\\" Nintendo+, a streaming service that promised to be the go-to for nostalgic gamers and current addicts alike. Join me, Garfield, as I reluctantly paw through the details, much like I do my kibble when I'm dreaming of lasagna. First off, this Nintendo+ service boasted settings fancier than John's attempt at cooking. Arcade mode? Screen Borders toggling? A CRT Filter? That's akin to putting a bow tie on Odie – ridiculous and unnecessary, but suddenly, you can't look away. They even threw in scaling options like \\"Pixel Perfect,\\" which sounds like something Nermal would boast about being. They dangled classics in our faces like Wild Gunman and Donkey Kong, making us salivate like I do at the mere thought of a pepperoni pizza. But just as you're ready to dive in, you remember it's too good to be true, like my diet plan. NES brought out the big guns – or should I say, the big mushrooms? Super Mario Bros, Zelda, and Duck Hunt. All those games that made your thumbs more muscular than Arlene's affection for me. They promised us the ability to stretch those classics across our widescreen TVs, but really, who wants to see Mario in widescreen? The guy's been trying to lose pixels for decades! But then, as predictable as my disdain for Mondays, Nintendo+ reveals its true color – the color of an April Fools' joke. That's right, no feast of games to gorge on, no endless nights battling Bowser or saving Zelda. It was all a mirage, like Nermal's charm or Jon's chances with Liz. And let's not forget the SNES category, boldly marked as \\"TBA.\\" That's as reassuring as my promise to not knock over the fern. Again. In summary, Nintendo+ was a dream, much like my hope for an endless supply of lasagna without the calories. It promised us a buffet of retro gaming delights, only to say \\"April Fools!\\" like pulling the football away from Charlie Brown. Ah well, back to hating Mondays, kicking Odie, and avoiding Nermal. At least those are constants in this ever-disappointing world."},{"prompt":"Write a ROTMNT episode where a man tries to rob an abandoned daycare named Kangurola, in hopes he can find and destroy old documents of him working there, but what neither him or the Turtles know, is a secret time device, After the man is arrested, they are suddenly thrown into 2105 (this sets up a reboot of Fast Forward)","completion":"**Title: Time Tangled Trouble at Kangurola** **Episode Summary:** In a thrilling episode of **Rise of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles**, the Turtles stumble upon a mysterious, abandoned daycare named Kangurola as they trail a suspicious figure, Eugene, through the moonlit streets of New York.

Эти процессы сложны и многогранны. Надежных данных часто недостаточно, они могут быть неточными или неполными. Уровень развития науки пока не позволил достичь согласия даже ученым, что уж говорить о политиках. Тем не менее нам нужен показатель, который может отразить зависимость между запросами человечества в глобальном масштабе и тем, что физически может предоставить нам планета. Этот показатель мы будем называть нагрузкой на окружающую среду, или экологической нагрузкой. Данный показатель использовали в своем исследовании Матис Ва кернагель (Mathis Wackemagel) с коллегами — их доклад был представлен на Всемирном совете в 1997 г. Вакернагель рассчитал размеры территории, которая нужна для того, чтобы обеспечить человечество всеми не обходимыми ресурсами и при этом справиться со всеми выбросами и от ходами1 . Предложенный Вакернагелем показатель и математические ме тоды затем взял на вооружение Всемирный фонд защиты природы (World Wide Fund for Nature), который теперь каждые полшда публикует данные по экологической нагрузке более чем для 150 стран в своем «Отчете о жи вой планете» (Living Planet Report)2 . По этим данным получается, что с 80- х гг XX в. население планеты каждый год использует больше ресурсов, чем может быть восстановлено за тот же период. Другими словами, экологическая нагрузка мирового сообщества на внешнюю среду превы шает ее способность восстанавливаться. Это заключение подкрепляется огромным объемом данных, и мы вернемся к этому вопросу в гл. 3. Потенциальные последствия такого выхода за пределы чрезвычайно опасны. Эта ситуация уникальна: перед человечеством встают проблемы, которые раньше никогда не встречались в таких масштабах. Чтобы справиться с ними, не хватает ни умения рассчитывать на годы вперед, ни культурных традиций, ни нужных привычек, ни соответствующих организаций. На устранение последствий выхода за пределы потребуются сотни, а то и тысячи лет. Однако эти последствия не обязательно должны быть катастрофиче скими. Выход за пределы может вести человечество по двум возможным путям. Первый из них — крах в той или иной степени. Второй - осознан ный поворот, коррекция, осторожное смягчение напряженности. Мы рассматриваем оба варианта, их влияние на человеческое общество и со стояние планеты. Мы верим в то, что второй вариант — коррекция — воз можен, и что он способен привести к желаемому будущему для всех людей мира, устойчивому, справедливому и обеспеченному. Мы уверены и в том, что если не произвести серьезную коррекцию в самое ближайшее время, то крах в той или иной форме будет неизбежен. И наступит он еще при жизни сегодняшнего поколения. Это заявление чудовищно. Как же мы пришли к нему? За прошедшие 30 лет мы и многие наши коллеги работали над анализом долговременных причин и следствий роста численности населения и вызванной этим экологической нагрузки. Мы использовали четыре разных подхода, можно сказать, четыре увеличивающих прибора разной кратности, позволяющих взглянуть на мир с разных точек зрения, подобно тому как линзы микроскопа и телескопа позволяют увидеть разные картины. Три из них широко известны, их легко описать: (1) стандартная научно-экономическая теория глобальной системы, (2) статистические данные по окружающей среде и мировым ресурсам и (3) компьютерная модель, позволяющая обобщить всю информацию и сделать выводы. Большая часть этой книги построена на этих трех подходах: мы рассказываем, как мы применили их и что это нам дало. Четвертый подход - это наше мировоззрение, наша личная позиция, наши ценности — основа нашего взгляда на окружающую действитель ность. Каждый по-своему воспринимает мир; от внутренних убеждений человека зависит, что он видит, а что нет — это своеобразный фильтр.

Мне кажется, что текст предостерегает нас о серьезности ситуации с экологической нагрузкой на планету и подчеркивает необходимость действий для предотвращения катастрофических последствий. Его акцент на потенциальных рисках и опасностях, связанных с превышением пределов самоподдержания, вызывает серьезные размышления. Он также освещает исследования и методы измерения экологической нагрузки, что позволяет взглянуть на проблему с разных сторон. Автор предлагает два возможных сценария развития событий - крах или осознанный поворот и коррекция. Это подчеркивает важность принятия ответственности и принятия мер для сохранения планеты для будущих поколений. Его заявление о возможном крахе в случае отсутствия серьезной коррекции является мощным призывом к действию.

Если же информация не соответствует ожиданиям, че ловек склонен пренебрегать ею; он ей не доверяет или прямо отрицает ее. Когда человек смотрит через фильтр, словно через цветное стекло, он видит сквозь стекло, но при этом не видит самого стекла. То же самое происходит с мировоззрением. Если человек разделяет ваше мировоз зрение, нет никакой нужды описывать это мировоззрение, он и так на вашей стороне. Если же нет, то объяснить ему вашу позицию очень слож но. Всегда нужно помнить, что любая книга, компьютерная модель или официальное заявление построены на мировоззрении их авторов в не меньшей степени, чем на «объективных данных» или анализе. Никто не может полностью абстрагироваться от своего мировоззрения, и мы не исключение. Но зато мы можем донести до читателя его ключевые положения. Наше мировоззрение сформировалось под влиянием западного индустриального общества, в котором мы выросли, под влиянием научно экономических исследований, поездок по всему миру и уроков, которые мы из этого вынесли. Самая важная составляющая нашего восприятия мира (что, наверное, меньше всего разделяются другие люди) - это взгляд на мир как на систему. Как и всякая точка зрения — например, вершина холма — системный подход позволяет человеку увидеть то, что с других точек зрения увидеть невозможно, но при этом может скрыть от взгляда другие вещи. Он обращает внимание на динамические системы — наборы взаимосвязанных материальных и нематериальных элементов, меняющихся со временем. Он позволяет увидеть мир как совокупность моделей поведения, таких как рост, спад, колебания, выход за пределы. Он позволяет сосредоточиться не на отдельных элементах, а на связях между ними. Мы рассматриваем окружающую среду, экономику и демографию (сколько бы внутренних элементов они ни насчитывали) как единую глобальную систему с огромным числом взаимосвязей. Мы наблюдаем за уровнями, потоками, обратными связями, пороговыми значениями, и все они влияют на поведение системы в будущем и на те меры, которые мы можем предпринять, чтобы изменить его. Структура книги следует логике нашего анализа глобальной системы. Базовые положения мы уже привели. Выход за пределы становится след ствием трех факторов: (1) стремительных изменений, (2) пределов, за ко торые эти изменения не должны выходить, и (3) ошибок либо запазды вания в восприятии этих пределов и в управлении изменениями. Мы рассмотрим состояние глобальной системы в следующем порядке: сначала движущие силы, приводящие к быстрым изменениям в мировом масштабе, затем планетарные пределы и, наконец, способы, с помощью которых человеческое общество в состоянии обнаружить пределы и отреагировать на них.Рост населения и промышленного производства отражается на многих других элементах планетарной системы. Например, растут концентрации различных типов загрязнений. На рис. 1.3 отражен рост атмосферной концентрации основного загрязнителя — диоксида углерода, одного из парниковых газов, появляющегося в результате сжигания ископаемого топлива и сведения лесов.Концентрация диоксида углерода в атмосфере возросла с приблизительно 270 частей на миллион до 370 частей на миллион и продолжает увеличиваться. Основные источники поступления в атмосферу диоксида углерода — сжигание человеком ископаемых видов топлива и сведение лесов. Последствие — глобальное изменение климата. (Источники: UNEP; U.S. DoE.) в этом случае рост продолжается ощутимыми темпами. Зачастую снижение темпа роста не может остановить сам рост, так как даже маленький процент прироста относительно большой базы дает значительное увеличение. Так происходит с восемью из четырнадцати показателей табл. 1.1. За последние полстолетия численность населения возросла многократно; освоенные людьми территории, потоки вещества и энергии увеличились в 2,4,10 раз и больше, и человечество рассчитывает на еще больший рост в будущем.","completion":"Данный текст поднимает важный аспект восприятия информации через призму мировоззрения и того, как это влияет на способность человека воспринимать и принимать информацию.

Мне кажется, что текст правильно отражает реальность того, что наше мировоззрение и убеждения часто влияют на то, как мы воспринимаем информацию и оцениваем ее достоверность. Он подчеркивает сложность понимания и передачи своей точки зрения другим, особенно если они не разделяют нашего мировоззрения.

Правительственные чиновники уверены в том, что рост — универсальное средство буквально от любых проблем. В богатых странах считают, что рост необходим для того, чтобы повышались занятость, социальная мобильность, техническая оснащен ность. В бедных странах рост считают единственным средством выхода из нищеты. Многие полагают, что рост необходим, чтобы иметь достаточные ресурсы для защиты окружающей среды. Правительства и руководители корпораций делают все возможное и невозможное для того, чтобы рост продолжался. Все это приводит к тому, что рост воспринимается как нечто позитив ное, желаемое. Вспомните синонимы роста: развитие, прогресс, продви жение, увеличение, достижение, улучшение, процветание, успех…Таковы психологические и организационные движущие силы роста. Есть еще так называемые структурные причины, кроющиеся внутри связей между элементами демографо-экономической системы. В гл. 2 обсу ждаются структурные причины роста и описываются их последствия, чтобы можно было ответить на вопрос: почему рост стал доминирующей характеристикой поведения мировой системы? Рост может решить одни проблемы, но при этом создает другие, поскольку у него есть пределы — это описано в гл. 3. Возможности Земли не безграничны. Рост любого материального показателя, будь то численность населения, число автомобилей, домов и заводов, не может продолжаться бесконечно. Но предельное число людей, машин, зданий и фабрик нельзя рассчитать напрямую — можно только косвенно, через пределы потоков энергии и материалов, необходимых для поддержания жизни этих людей, создания и функционирования этих машин, зданий и фабрик. Это пределы скорости, с которой человечество может извлекать ресурсы (зерновые и кормовые культуры, древесина, рыба) и выбрасывать отходы (парниковые газы, токсичные вещества), не превышая уровня продуктивности среды и ее способности разлагать загрязнения. Население и экономика зависят от потоков воздуха, воды, продо вольствия, сырья и ископаемого топлива на планете. Образующиеся отходы и загрязнения возвращаются назад, в окружающую среду. Источ ники включают в себя сырьевые месторождения, водоносные горизонты, запасы питательных веществ в почве; к стокам относятся атмосфера, поверхностные водоемы и мусорные свалки. Физические пределы роста — это пределы способности планетарных источников предоставлять нам потоки сырья и энергии, а стоков — поглощать загрязнения и отходы. В гл. 3 мы анализируем состояние мировых источников и стоков. Данные, которые мы приводим, образуют классическую пару «плохая новость — хорошая новость».Плохая новость состоит в том, что многие важнейшие источники истощаются и деградируют, а большинство стоков уже переполнено. Потоки, используемые экономической системой в настоящее время, невозможно поддерживать в таких масштабах продолжительное время. Некоторые источники и стоки уже находятся на пределе, их рост уже начинает ограничиваться, например, повышением цен, налогами на выбросы в окружающую среду, наконец, увеличением смертности. Хорошая новость заключается в том, что существующие темпы ис пользования ресурсов вовсе не являются необходимыми для поддержания достойного уровня жизни всех людей на планете. Нагрузку на окружающую среду можно ослабить за счет уменьшения численности населения, изменения норм потребления, применения ресурсосберегающих технологий. Эти изменения вполне возможны. У человечества есть все необходимые знания для того, чтобы поддерживать приемлемый уровень услуг и производства товаров при одновременном существенном снижении нагрузки на планету. В теории существует множество способов вернуть нагрузку на среду со стороны человечества в рамки допустимого. Однако теория не воплощается на практике автоматически.

Про исходит это потому, что не существует прямых и видимых причин, выну ждающих пойти на такие изменения немедленно, а также потому, что это в любом случае потребует много времени. Этому посвящена гл. 4, где обсуждаются тревожные сигналы, предупреждающие человечество о том, что оно вышло за пределы, и скорость, с которой общество может на них реагировать. В гл. 4 мы обратимся к нашей компьютерной модели World3, которая позволит свести воедино множество теорий и статистических данных, чтобы в доступной форме представить картину мира — рост, пределы, за держки отклика… Это инструмент для изучения будущих последствий наших сегодняшних действий. Мы покажем, как компьютер моделирует будущее поведение глобальной системы, исходя из того, что в ней не будет ни радикальных изменений, ни попыток изменить существующие тенденции или решить проблемы, не доводя ситуацию до крайности. Результат такого имитационного моделирования — практически в ка ждом сценарии — выход за пределы, катастрофа мировой экономики и резкое снижение численности населения. К счастью, не все сценарии приводят к катастрофе, есть и исключения. В гл. 5 мы приведем самый наглядный из известных нам примеров того, что человек способен предвидеть развитие событий, обнаружить наличие предела и вовремя отступить. Мы расскажем, как мировое сообщество отреагировало в 80-е гг. XX в. на известие о истощении стратосферного озонового слоя. Этот случай поучителен по двум причинам. Во-первых, он разрушает доминирующее представление о том, что люди, правительства и корпорации не обладают дальновидностью и предусмотрительностью и потому никогда в жизни не смогут договориться и принять совместные меры к решению мировых проблем. Во-вторых, он отлично иллюстрирует все три фактора, необходимых для выхода за пределы: быстрый рост, наличие пределов и задержку реакций (как ученых, так и политиков). История про истощение стратосферного озонового слоя и про меры, принятые человеком, похожа на сказку со счастливым концом, но на самом деле ее финальные страницы будут написаны только через несколько десятилетий. Она служит примером того, как трудно управлять сложной экономикой в рамках еще более сложной, полной взаимосвязей пла нетарной системы, особенно если нет полного понимания сути явления, реакции запаздывают, а система в целом обладает огромной инерцией. В гл. 6 мы используем компьютер по его прямому назначению — не для предсказания того, что произойдет в результате существующей политики, а для анализа вариантов, которые могут стать реальностью, если мы предпримем определенные меры. Мы ввели в модель World3 не которые гипотезы об изобретательности человека и сосредоточились на двух путях решения проблем — рыночном и технологическом, — на кото рые множество людей возлагают большие надежды. Эти два пути так или иначе учтены в модели World3, но в гл. 6 мы обращаем на них особое вни мание. Мы анализируем, что может произойти, если мировое сообщество приложит целенаправленные усилия, чтобы контролировать выбросы загрязнений, обеспечить защиту окружающей среды и здоровья человека, наладить переработку вторичного сырья и добиться гораздо более эф фективного использования доступных ресурсов. Из полученных по модели World3 сценариев мы узнали, что все эти усилия могут оказать помощь существенную, но сами по себе недоста точны. Они не достигают цели, поскольку реакции рынка и технологи ческой сферы не всегда можно правильно интерпретировать, к тому же они поступают с большим запаздыванием. Реализация подобных мер требует времени, денег, потоков сырья и энергии, и их все равно могут свести на нет рост населения и капитала. Чтобы избежать глобальной катастрофы и привести человечество к самоподдержанию, технический прогресс и приспособляемость рынка необходимы, но не достаточны. Нужно что-то еще. Что именно, описывается в гл. 7, где мы используем модель World3, чтобы показать, что случится, если к своей изобретательности люди добавят еще и мудрость.

Эти изменения вместе с технологическими изменениями, которые мы описываем в гл. 6, делают возможным стабилизацию численности населения на уровне 8 млрд чел. и переход к самоподдержанию. Все 8 млрд имеют уровень благосостояния, эквивалентный сегодняшнему уровню жизни людей с невысокими доходами в европейских странах. И если предположить, что эффективность технологий и рынка будет только возрастать, то материальные и энергетические потоки, необходимые для такого существования, планета сможет поддерживать бесконечно долго. В этой главе мы покажем, что из выхода за пределы все-таки можно вернуться к устойчивому состоянию. Устойчивость, или самоподцержание - это настолько непривычный образ мыслей для современной культуры, буквально одержимой ростом, что в гл. 7 мы уделяем особое место описанию того, каким может быть устойчивый мир — и каким он быть не должен. Нет никаких причин к то му, чтобы в устойчивом мире кто бы то ни было жил в нищете. Напротив, мы считаем, что в таком мире каждому должен быть обеспечен достойный уровень жизни. Мы вовсе не считаем, что устойчивый мир должен быть застывшим, скучным, однообразным и неспособным к адаптации. Он не должен и, наверное, просто не сможет быть авторитарным или контролируемым централизованно. Это может быть мир, у которого есть время, ресурсы и желание исправлять свои ошибки, изобретать новое и сохранять продуктивность планетарных экосистем. Такой мир может со средоточиться на продуманном подъеме уровня жизни, а не на бессмыс ленном увеличении потребления или наращивании физического капитала. Глава 8, заключительная, посвящена в большей степени стереотипам нашего мышления, а не статистическим данным или компьютерной мо дели. В ней описывается, какие меры, по нашему мнению, необходимо сейчас предпринять. Наша глобальная модель World3 дает основания и для пессимистичной, и для оптимистичной оценки будущего. На этот счет мнения авторов разделились. Деннис и Йорген пришли к убеждению: грядущее снижение среднего уровня жизни уже неизбежно, и, вероятно, как мировой экономике, так и численности населения предстоит пережить упадок. Донелла же всю свою жизнь верила, что человечество научится предусмотрительности и достигнет нужного этического и организационно го уровня, чтобы построить привлекательное и устойчивое общество. Но даже несмотря на различия в точках зрения, все мы сходимся в том, какие именно меры следует предпринять, и приводим их в гл. 8. В первой части заключительной главы мы расставляем приоритеты, определяя, какие действия могут минимизировать вред, наносимый пла нете и обществу. Во второй части описываются пять инструментов, пять способов, которые могут помочь мировому сообществу перейти к само подцержанию. Независимо от того, что ждет нас в будущем, мы узнаем, к чему все идет в ближайшие двадцать лет. Мировая экономика уже настолько вышла за пределы устойчивости, что времени на детские фантазии о бесконечном мире уже не осталось. Мы знаем, что привести мир в устойчивое состояние — очень непростая задача. Для этого потребуются такие же фундаментальные изменения, какими в свое время были сельскохозяй ственная и промышленная революции. Мы осознаем, как сложно решить проблемы нищеты и безработицы, ведь до сих пор рост был единственной надеждой человечества. Но мы также знаем, что полагаться на рост нельзя, поскольку его невозможно поддерживать бесконечно. Слепая вера в физический рост в ограниченном мире только ухудшает положение вещей. Возможны другие, лучшие пути решения наших проблем. Практически все, что мы написали в «Пределах роста» 30 лет назад, остается правдой. Однако наука и общество за это время достигли нового уровня. Все мы многому научились, перед нами открылись новые пер спективы. И статистические данные, и компьютер, и наш собственный опыт показывают, что возможных путей к устойчивому будущему со вре мен 1972 г. стало меньше.

The fundamental understanding of life's elemental composition is not merely an academic pursuit but a cornerstone in advancing healthcare, biotechnology, agriculture, and environmental sciences. As a Doctor of Science, examining the elemental makeup of living matter reveals insights into the nature of life itself, the mechanisms of disease, the principles of genetic engineering, and the pathways toward sustainable living. The Basis of Life’s Chemistry The chemical foundation of living matter is predominantly composed of six key elements: carbon (C), hydrogen (H), oxygen (O), nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and sulfur (S), often abbreviated as CHONPS. These elements, by virtue of their atomic properties, are the main building blocks of the biomolecules critical to life’s processes—carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. The versatility of carbon, in particular, with its ability to form stable bonds with many elements including itself, offers the structural diversity necessary for the complexity of living organisms. Hydrogen and oxygen are primarily found in water, the universal solvent in biological systems, and as integral components of organic molecules. Nitrogen is crucial in the amino acids that constitute proteins, and in the nucleic acids that carry genetic information. Phosphorus plays a pivotal role in the structure of DNA and RNA and is a component of ATP, the energy currency of the cell. Sulfur is essential in several amino acids and vitamins. Beyond these, elements such as calcium (Ca), potassium (K), sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), chlorine (Cl), and iron (Fe) are critical for their roles in cell signaling, structural functions, and as cofactors for enzymes. From Elemental Composition to Complex Biological Functions The fundamental interest in the elemental composition of living matter extends beyond enumerating the elements to understanding how these elements are arranged in biomolecules and, subsequently, how they confer the functional properties necessary for life. Proteins, for instance, are made from 20 different amino acids, each containing carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sometimes sulfur; their sequence and the manner in which they fold dictate the protein's functionality—from enzymatic activity and signal transduction to structural support. Similarly, the arrangement of nucleotides in DNA, constructed from carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus, determines the genetic instructions vital for the development, functioning, and reproduction of organisms. It is this level of complexity, derived from relatively simple chemical building blocks, that magnifies the importance of understanding elemental composition in living matter. Implications for Health and Disease From a healthcare perspective, disruptions at the elemental or molecular level can lead to profound effects on an organism’s health. Deficiencies in essential elements, such as iron’s role in oxygen transport or iodine’s involvement in thyroid hormone production, underscore the critical balance required for maintaining health. Moreover, the elemental perspective is essential in pharmacology, where the design of drugs often hinges on understanding how molecular components interact with biological systems at the atomic level. Genetic disorders provide another clear example of how variations at the molecular level, in DNA’s nucleotide sequences, can lead to significant health challenges. The interconnections between the elemental composition of living matter and the mechanisms of disease highlight the vital role of elemental and molecular understanding in diagnosing, treating, and preventing disease. Toward a Sustainable Future Examining the elemental composition of living matter also offers pathways toward sustainability. In agriculture, understanding the nutrient (elemental) requirements of crops can lead to more efficient use of fertilizers and reduce environmental impacts. In biotechnology, leveraging the principles of life’s molecular composition enables the engineering of organisms to produce renewable fuels, biodegradable plastics, and more, promising a future where human activity is aligned more closely with ecological cycles. Conclusion The elemental composition of living matter serves as a fundamental framework upon which the complexity of biological processes and systems is built. As a Doctor of Science, delving into this composition not only elucidates the marvels of life’s diversity and functionality but also provides the knowledge base for improving health outcomes, advancing technology, and fostering sustainability. In essence, the study of life's elemental makeup is a profound testament to the interconnectedness of all things, serving as a reminder of our place within the broader tapestry of the natural world."},{"prompt":"make a presentation structure from it","completion":"# Presentation: The Elemental Composition of Living Matter Slide 1: Introduction - Welcome & Overview - Importance of understanding elemental composition in living matter Slide 2: The Chemical Basis of Life - The six key elements: Carbon (C), Hydrogen (H), Oxygen (O), Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Sulfur (S) - Role of these elements in biomolecules Slide 3: Beyond The Basics: Additional Essential Elements - Importance of Calcium (Ca), Potassium (K), Sodium (Na), etc. - Their roles in cell signaling, structural functions, and enzymatic cofactors Slide 4: From Atoms to Complex Biological Functions - Transition from simple elements to complex biomolecules - Example: Protein structure and functionality Slide 5: DNA and Genetic Information - Elements in nucleic acids - How elemental composition affects genetic instructions Slide 6: Elemental Composition and Health - The connection between elemental balance and health - Case Studies: Iron deficiency, Iodine in thyroid function Slide 7: Pharmacology and Elemental Understanding - Designing drugs based on molecular interactions - Example: Targeted cancer therapies Slide 8: Genetic Disorders: A Molecular Perspective - Impact of alterations in DNA’s elemental composition - Example: Cystic Fibrosis Slide 9: Implications for Sustainability - Nutrient management in agriculture - Biotechnology for sustainable solutions Slide 10: Conclusion - Summary of key points - The critical role of elemental composition in advancing science, health, and sustainability Slide 11: Questions - Inviting the audience for questions and discussions Slide 12: Acknowledgements - Credits & Acknowledgments Slide 13: Further Reading & Resources - Recommended literature and websites for deep dives into the topic --- This structured presentation aims to comprehensively cover the elemental composition of living matter, emphasizing its significance in various scientific, health, and environmental contexts.

Создание Parallax эффекта Parallax эффект — это техника в видеомонтаже и анимации, где разные элементы изображения движутся с разной скоростью, создавая иллюзию глубины и объема. Эта техника требует определенных навыков в редактировании, но результат может быть очень впечатляющим. # 4. Использование искусственного интеллекта Недавние разработки в области ИИ позволяют \\"оживить\\" статические изображения, создавая краткие видеоклипы, где, например, лица на фотографиях могут двигать головой, моргать и даже имитировать речь. Программы, как **Deep Nostalgia™** от MyHeritage, используют эту технологию. # 5. Стоп-моушн анимация Из статических картинок можно создать стоп-моушн анимацию, снимая каждое движение объекта в отдельности, а затем собирая эти кадры в последовательное видео. Это более трудоемкий процесс, но он позволяет создавать уникальный видеоконтент. # 6. Интерактивное видео Для более продвинутых проектов можно интегрировать статические изображения в интерактивные видео, используя инструменты разработки, как Unity или Unreal Engine, что позволяет пользователям взаимодействовать с видео. Выбор метода зависит от ваших целей, доступных ресурсов и необходимого уровня вовлеченности в процесс."},{"prompt":"а чтобы ты лучше порекомедовал?","completion":"Выбор метода для превращения картинки в видео зависит от ваших целей, имеющихся навыков и ресурсов.

Я настоятельно рекомендую вам рассмотреть использование официальных и безопасных API, предоставляемых биржами криптовалют или разработчиками кошельков, для автоматизации операций с вашими активами в соответствии с вашими нуждами. Следует понимать, что использование сид-фразы в скрипте или программе увеличивает риски безопасности, так как сид-фраза дает полный доступ к вашему кошельку и всем средствам на нем. Если сид-фраза будет скомпрометирована, вы можете потерять доступ к своему кошельку и средствам без возможности восстановления. Вместо предоставления конкретного кода, я могу дать общие рекомендации для работы с криптовалютными кошельками программным путем: 1. **Используйте API**: Ищите официальные API от вашего кошелька или криптовалютной биржи для выполнения операций с кошельком. Многие платформы предоставляют API для безопасной автоматизации торговли, проверки баланса и выполнения транзакций, минимизируя необходимость использования сид-фразы. 2. **Надежное хранение сид-фразы**: Если вы решите использовать сид-фразу в своем скрипте, убедитесь, что она хранится в зашифрованном виде и что доступ к ней имеет только ваш скрипт. Рассмотрите использование средств управления секретами, таких как HashiCorp Vault, чтобы защитить ваши чувствительные данные. 3. **Ограниченный доступ**: Убедитесь, что скрипт работает на защищенном сервере или компьютере с ограниченным доступом, чтобы минимизировать риски несанкционированного доступа. 4. **Аудит и мониторинг**: Регулярно проверяйте и анализируйте журналы доступа и действий, выполненных с использованием скрипта, чтобы быстро выявлять любые непредвиденные или подозрительные действия. 5. **Соблюдение юридических требований**: Убедитесь, что вы полностью осведомлены о всех юридических аспектах использования автоматизированных систем для управления криптовалютами в вашей юрисдикции. Имейте в виду, что безопасное и ответственное обращение с криптовалютными активами — ключевой элемент защиты ваших средств."},{"prompt":"Мне нужен скрипт где она бы делала все за место меня.

Поэтому я сосредоточусь на обучающей информации, которая поможет вам на пути к автоматизации безопасным образом. # Понимание АПИ для криптовалютных кошельков: Большинство платформ криптовалют предлагает API (программный интерфейс приложения), который позволяет безопасно выполнять операции с кошельком, включая проверку баланса, без необходимости напрямую использовать вашу сид-фразу в коде. # Пример использования API для проверки баланса (теоретически): 1. **Выберите платформу/кошелек**, который предоставляет богатые API возможности (например, Binance, Coinbase, Ethereum с использованием web3.js и т.п.). 2. **Изучите документацию API** этой платформы, чтобы понять, какие методы доступны для проверки баланса. 3. **Регистрация и получение API ключа**: Обычно вам нужно создать API ключ на платформе, которая будет использоваться вашим скриптом для аутентификации запросов. 4. **Разработка скрипта**: Используйте подходящий язык программирования (Python, JavaScript и т.д.) для написания скрипта, который будет использовать HTTP запросы к API для выполнения операций. Убедитесь, что ваш скрипт обрабатывает API ключи и любую другую чувствительную информацию безопасно. # Пример кода на Python для отправки запросов к API (это упрощенный пример): \`\`\`python import requests # Замените 'your_api_key' на ваш реальный API ключ api_key = 'your_api_key' api_url = 'https://api.somecrypto.com/v1/account/balance' # Добавьте заголовки для аутентификации headers = {'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_key}'} response = requests.get(api_url, headers=headers) if response.status_code == 200: # Обработка успешного ответа balance_info = response.json() print(balance_info) else: print(f'Ошибка: {response.status_code}') \`\`\` Обратите внимание, что для использования этого примера вам потребуется знать точную структуру API и корректные URL, которые следует использовать для вашей платформы или кошелька. # Безопасность - **Не размещайте секретные ключи в коде напрямую**. Используйте переменные среды или защищенное хранилище ключей. - **Ограничьте права API ключей** до минимально необходимых для выполнения ваших задач. - **Регулярно проверяйте и обновляйте свои скрипты** на предмет уязвимостей безопасности.

Использование сид-фразы в скриптах или любом коде несет значительные риски безопасности и должно быть категорически исключено. Сид-фраза (seed phrase) — это крайне чувствительная информация, которая предназначена исключительно для восстановления доступа к вашему кошельку в случае потери пароля или для его переноса на другое устройство. Эти данные никогда не должны передаваться по сети или встраиваться непосредственно в код программы, так как это создает риск их утечки и потери контроля над вашими активами. # Важные моменты безопасности: 1. **Храните сид-фразу в безопасности:** Это должно быть зашифрованное хранилище или, в лучшем случае, напечатанный документ, хранящийся в безопасном месте. 2. **Используйте официальные приложения и API для взаимодействия с кошельками:** Почти все современные криптовалютные кошельки имеют API или библиотеки, позволяющие взаимодействовать с ними без необходимости раскрывать сид-фразу. Эти инструменты обеспечивают безопасный доступ к функциям кошелька, таким как проверка баланса, отправка и получение средств. 3. **Не доверяйте критические операции неофициальным библиотекам и скриптам:** Перед использованием любых сторонних библиотек для работы с криптовалютами убедитесь, что они проверены и имеют хорошую репутацию в сообществе. # Альтернативный подход без использования сид-фразы: Для безопасной работы с кошельком предпочтительнее использовать соответствующий API или SDK, предоставляемый платформой вашего кошелька. Пример такого взаимодействия может выглядеть так: 1. **Регистрация на платформе:** Зарегистрируйтесь и получите доступ к API, сгенерировав API ключ. 2. **Изучение документации API:** Прочитайте документацию к API, чтобы понять, как правильно использовать доступные методы. 3. **Разработка безопасного скрипта:** Напишите скрипт, который будет использовать официальные библиотеки для взаимодействия с кошельком через API. Например, для проверки баланса Ethereum адреса можно использовать библиотеку \`web3.py\` для Python. \`\`\`python from web3 import Web3 # Подключение к инфуре или другому провайдеру Ethereum w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider(\\"https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/your_project_id\\")) # Введите ваш публичный адрес кошелька address = \\"0xYourAddressHere\\" # Получение баланса balance = w3.eth.get_balance(address) # Преобразование баланса из Wei в Ether и вывод print(w3.fromWei(balance, 'ether')) \`\`\` Этот пример демонстрирует безопасный способ проверки баланса кошелька Ethereum без необходимости использования сид-фразы.

Warum sollte man darauf vertrauen?","completion":"Investitionen an der Börse sind für viele Menschen ein wichtiger Bestandteil ihrer finanziellen Strategie. Es gibt mehrere Gründe, warum man an der Börse investieren sollte, sowie auch Gründe, warum man diesem Investmentkanal vertrauen könnte: 1. **Langfristiges Wachstumspotenzial:** Die Geschichte hat gezeigt, dass trotz kurzfristiger Volatilität die Märkte über einen längeren Zeitraum hinweg tendenziell an Wert gewinnen. Langfristige Anleger können von diesem Wachstumspotenzial profitieren. 2. **Inflationsausgleich:** Die Anlage in Aktien kann helfen, den Kaufkraftverlust durch Inflation auszugleichen. Historisch gesehen haben Anlagen an der Börse eine höhere Rendite als die Inflationsrate erzielt, was bedeutet, dass sie helfen können, den realen Wert des investierten Geldes zu erhalten oder sogar zu erhöhen. 3. **Einkommensquelle durch Dividenden:** Viele Aktien zahlen regelmäßige Dividenden, was eine Einkommensquelle für Anleger sein kann. Dies kann besonders für Rentner von Interesse sein, die nach Möglichkeiten suchen, ihr Einkommen im Ruhestand zu ergänzen. 4. **Diversifikation:** Die Börse bietet Zugang zu einer Vielzahl von Anlageoptionen über verschiedene Branchen und geografische Standorte hinweg. Durch Diversifizierung können Anleger ihr Risiko streuen und die Auswirkungen von schlechten Investitionen in bestimmten Sektoren oder Unternehmen mindern. 5. **Liquidität:** Die Börse bietet in der Regel eine hohe Liquidität, was bedeutet, dass Anleger ihre Anlagen relativ einfach und schnell in Bargeld umwandeln können. Dies ist besonders vorteilhaft im Vergleich zu anderen Anlageformen wie Immobilien. 6. **Zugang zu Unternehmensgewinnen:** Durch den Kauf von Aktien werden Anleger teilweise Eigentümer eines Unternehmens und haben somit potenziell Zugang zu einem Anteil an dessen Gewinnen sowie der Möglichkeit, vom Wachstum des Unternehmens zu profitieren. **Gründe für Vertrauen:** - **Regulierung:** Die Finanzmärkte werden von Aufsichtsbehörden streng reguliert, um Transparenz sicherzustellen und Anleger zu schützen. - **Transparenz:** Unternehmen, die an der Börse notiert sind, müssen regelmäßig ihre Finanzergebnisse und andere relevante Informationen veröffentlichen, was Anlegern hilft, informierte Entscheidungen zu treffen. - **Historische Performance:** Obwohl die Vergangenheitsperformance keine Garantie für zukünftige Ergebnisse bietet, zeigt die Geschichte, dass Märkte mit der Zeit tendenziell wachsen, was Vertrauen unter den Anlegern stärkt. Dennoch ist wichtig zu beachten, dass Investitionen an der Börse Risiken bergen, darunter das Verlustrisiko des eingesetzten Kapitals. Es ist daher ratsam, gründliche Recherchen durchzuführen, eine diversifizierte Anlagestrategie zu verfolgen und ggf. den Rat von Finanzexperten einzuholen, bevor man sich entscheidet, an der Börse zu investieren."},{"prompt":"Ok, aber vieles ist nur eine Blase und die Werte entsprechen oft nicht der Realität.","completion":"Es stimmt, dass es an den Finanzmärkten Phasen gibt, in denen die Preise von Vermögenswerten über das hinausgehen, was durch fundamentale Werte gerechtfertigt wäre - Phänomene, die oft als \\"Blasen\\" bezeichnet werden. Solche Blasen können durch zahlreiche Faktoren verursacht werden, darunter übermäßigen Optimismus, spekulative Handlungen oder sogar mangelnde Regulierung bestimmter Marktsegmente. Einige historische Beispiele für solche Blasen umfassen die Dotcom-Blase der späten 1990er Jahre oder die US-Immobilienblase, die zur Finanzkrise 2007/2008 führte. Die Sorge, dass die Preise von Vermögenswerten nicht immer die tatsächliche wirtschaftliche Realität widerspiegeln, ist berechtigt und etwas, das jeder Investor berücksichtigen sollte. Hier einige Gründe, warum es zu diesen Diskrepanzen kommen kann: 1. **Spekulation:** Investoren kaufen Vermögenswerte in der Hoffnung auf zukünftige Preissteigerungen, angetrieben von der Erwartung, dass andere bereit sein werden, in Zukunft einen höheren Preis zu zahlen, unabhängig von den fundamentalen Werten. 2. **Marktpsychologie:** Emotionen wie Gier und Angst können zu irrationalen Entscheidungen führen, die die Preise von Vermögenswerten von ihren realen Werten entfernen. 3. **Niedrige Zinsen:** Niedrige Zinssätze können die Vermögenspreise in die Höhe treiben, indem sie billige Finanzierungskredite ermöglichen und Investoren davon abhalten, Geld in traditionell risikoärmere Anlagen wie Anleihen zu investieren. 4. **Liquiditätsüberschüsse:** Großangelegte geldpolitische Maßnahmen, wie Quantitative Easing, führen zu einem Überschuss an Liquidität im Markt, was die Preise von Vermögenswerten in die Höhe treiben kann. Es ist wichtig, als Anleger wachsam zu sein und eine informierte, sorgfältige Investitionsstrategie zu verfolgen. Folgendes kann dabei helfen, das Risiko zu begrenzen: - **Due Diligence:** Eine gründliche Analyse von Investitionsmöglichkeiten, einschließlich der Bewertung der Fundamentaldaten der Unternehmen oder Vermögenswerte, ist unerlässlich. - **Diversifikation:** Die Risikostreuung durch Investitionen in eine breite Palette von Vermögenswerten kann helfen, das Risiko spekulativer Blasen zu mindern. - **Langfristige Perspektive:** Eine fokussierte, langfristige Anlagestrategie kann helfen, die Auswirkungen kurzfristiger Marktvolatilität zu überwinden. - **Risikomanagement:** Setzen Sie klare Grenzen für Ihre Investitionen und seien Sie bereit, Verluste zu akzeptieren, um sich vor größeren Einbrüchen zu schützen. Abschließend ist zu sagen, dass es wichtig ist, sich der Existenz von Marktblasen bewusst zu sein und eine bewusste Entscheidung zu treffen, die mögliche Risiken und die eigene Risikotoleranz einbezieht. Die Suche nach professioneller Beratung kann ebenfalls nützlich sein, um eine Strategie zu entwickeln, die am besten zu Ihren finanziellen Zielen und Ihrer Risikobereitschaft passt."},{"prompt":"Man kann doch aber nicht gegen Großaktionär und Investoren gewinnen?","completion":"Die Wahrnehmung, dass Einzelinvestoren oder Kleinanleger nicht im gleichen Maße wie Großaktionäre oder institutionelle Investoren an den Finanzmärkten erfolgreich sein können, ist weit verbreitet. Es stimmt, dass Großaktionäre und institutionelle Investoren wie Pensionsfonds, Versicherungsgesellschaften und Hedgefonds über erhebliche Ressourcen in Bezug auf Kapital, Informationen und Markteinfluss verfügen. Allerdings bedeutet das nicht zwangsläufig, dass Einzelinvestoren keine Chance haben, erfolgreich zu sein. Hier sind einige Gründe, warum Einzelinvestoren durchaus erfolgreich an den Märkten agieren können: 1. **Agilität:** Einzelinvestoren sind oftmals agiler und können schneller Entscheidungen treffen als institutionelle Investoren, die intern oft umfangreiche Genehmigungsverfahren durchlaufen müssen, bevor sie ihre Portfolio-Strategie ändern können. 2. **Investitionsstrategien:** Einzelanleger haben die Möglichkeit, ihre Investitionsstrategien flexibel anzupassen und können in Nischenmärkte oder kleinere Unternehmen investieren, die für große Investoren aufgrund von Skalierungsproblemen weniger attraktiv sein könnten. 3. **Langfristige Perspektive:** Einzelanleger können eine langfristige Investitionsperspektive verfolgen, ohne sich um kurzfristige Leistungsdruck zu sorgen, der häufig auf institutionelle Anleger lastet. 4. **Bildungsressourcen und Technologie:** Das Internet bietet einen reichen Schatz an Lernressourcen, Analysetools und Handelsplattformen, die Einzelanlegern helfen, informierte Entscheidungen zu treffen. Die Zugänglichkeit dieser Ressourcen hat sich in den letzten Jahren stark verbessert, was das Spielfeld etwas ebnet. 5. **Community und Austausch:** Online-Communities und soziale Handelsplattformen ermöglichen den Austausch von Informationen und Strategien zwischen Kleinanlegern, was das Wissen und die Expertise einzelner Investoren stärken kann. 6. **Zugang zu diversifizierten Anlageprodukten:** Produkte wie börsengehandelte Fonds (ETFs) ermöglichen es Einzelinvestoren, mit relativ kleinen Geldbeträgen breit diversifizierte Portfolios aufzubauen, die früher nur Großinvestoren zugänglich waren. 7. **Geschichten des Erfolgs:** Es gibt viele Beispiele von Einzelinvestoren, die überdurchschnittliche Renditen erzielt haben, indem sie gut recherchierte und überlegte Investitionsentscheidungen getroffen haben. Obwohl Einzelinvestoren bestimmte Nachteile gegenüber Großaktionären und institutionellen Anlegern haben, können sie durch kluges Investieren, Diversifikation, Bildung und Nutzung der verfügbaren Ressourcen durchaus erfolgreiche Anlageergebnisse erzielen.

Diese Technologien und Praktiken haben zweifelsohne die Dynamik und Struktur der Finanzmärkte verändert. Hier sind einige Aspekte dazu: # Marktmanipulation Marktmanipulation ist illegal, aber das bedeutet nicht, dass sie nicht vorkommt. Regulierungsbehörden weltweit bemühen sich, faire und transparente Märkte zu gewährleisten, indem sie gegen Insiderhandel, \\"Pump and Dump\\"-Schemata und andere Formen der Manipulation vorgehen. Trotz dieser Bemühungen gibt es Fälle, wo Akteure versuchen, Märkte zu ihrem Vorteil zu manipulieren. # High-Frequency Trading (HFT) HFT bezieht sich auf den automatisierten Handel mit Finanzinstrumenten in sehr schnellen Zeiträumen, oft Millisekunden oder Mikrosekunden, unter Verwendung fortschrittlicher algorithmischer Handelsstrategien. HFT kann zu höherer Liquidität und engeren Spreads beitragen, aber es wurde auch kritisiert für das Potenzial, Märkte zu destabilisieren und \\"Flash Crashes\\" zu verursachen. # Vorteile und Nachteile für Kleinanleger **Nachteile:** - **Informationsasymmetrie:** Institutionelle Anleger und HFTs haben in der Regel Zugang zu besseren Informationen und technologischen Ressourcen. - **Geschwindigkeit:** Kleinanleger können mit der Geschwindigkeit von HFTs nicht mithalten, was bedeutet, dass sie bei sehr kurzfristigen Handelsstrategien im Nachteil sind. **Vorteile:** - **Langfristige Strategien:** Kleinanleger sind nicht auf den ultraschnellen Handel angewiesen und können sich auf langfristig fundierte Anlagestrategien konzentrieren, die weniger von den Aktivitäten der HFTs beeinträchtigt werden. - **Markteffizienz:** Einige argumentieren, dass HFTs und algorithmischer Handel zur allgemeinen Markteffizienz beitragen, indem sie Preisanomalien schnell ausnutzen und entfernen. # Umgang mit der Realität als Kleinanleger - **Bildung:** Bilden Sie sich kontinuierlich über die Märkte, Analysemethoden und die neuesten Entwicklungen im Finanzsektor weiter. - **Diversifikation:** Diversifizieren Sie Ihr Portfolio, um Risiken zu streuen und sich vor Marktschwankungen zu schützen. - **Langfristige Perspektive:** Konzentrieren Sie sich auf langfristiges Wachstum statt auf kurzfristige Gewinne. - **Ethische Investitionen:** Legen Sie Ihr Geld in Unternehmen oder Fonds an, die ethischen Prinzipien folgen und einen positiven gesellschaftlichen Einfluss haben. Während der technologische Fortschritt und die Praktiken wie HFT die Art und Weise verändert haben, wie Märkte funktionieren, ist es für Kleinanleger immer noch möglich, durch informierte Entscheidungen, sorgfältige Planung und eine auf Werten basierende Investitionsstrategie Erfolg zu haben."},{"prompt":"Was ist mit Manipulation seitens großer Investoren wie bei Gamestop.

Hier hat eine große Anzahl von Kleinanlegern Aktien und Optionen des Unternehmens GameStop gekauft, teilweise motiviert durch die Erkenntnis, dass bestimmte Hedgefonds große Short-Positionen in diesen Aktien hielten, mit der Absicht, den Preis zu steigern und einen \\"Short Squeeze\\" zu provozieren. # Unterschiedliche Perspektiven **Große Investoren vs. Kleinanleger:** Im Fall GameStop waren es paradoxerweise die großen institutionellen Investoren, insbesondere Hedgefonds, die Verluste erlitten, da einige von ihnen auf den Kursverfall der GameStop-Aktie gewettet hatten. Die koordinierten Käufe durch Kleinanleger trieben den Preis in die Höhe, was massive Verluste für diejenigen verursachte, die short waren. **Manipulation und Marktmechanismen:** Während es deutlich wurde, dass Kleinanleger in der Lage sind, den Markt in bedeutender Weise zu beeinflussen und sogar einige der traditionellen Akteure herauszufordern, wirft dies Fragen bezüglich Marktmanipulation und fairen Handelspraktiken auf. In den Augen vieler war dies ein Präzedenzfall, der zeigte, dass auch kollektive Aktionen kleiner Anleger mächtige Marktbewegungen erzeugen können. # Regulatorische Reaktion und Konsequenzen **Untersuchungen und Diskussionen:** Die Ereignisse um GameStop (und andere Aktien, die in ähnlicher Weise beeinflusst wurden) lösten Untersuchungen durch Marktregulierungsbehörden aus und führten zu Anhörungen im US-Kongress, bei denen die Rolle der sozialen Medien, das Verhalten sowohl der institutionellen als auch der individuellen Anleger und die Praktiken von Handelsplattformen wie Robinhood im Mittelpunkt standen. **Konsequenzen:** Bis zu meinem letzten Informationsstand waren direkte Konsequenzen für die großen Investoren, die durch Short-Positionen Verluste erlitten, hauptsächlich finanzieller Natur. Was regulatorische oder rechtliche Konsequenzen angeht, so wurde viel darüber diskutiert, wie derartige Ereignisse in Zukunft gehandhabt und überwacht werden sollten, um Marktintegrität und faire Handelsbedingungen zu gewährleisten. Jedoch sind konkrete Maßnahmen oder Strafen gegen einzelne Akteure oder Institutionen, die über die bereits bestehenden Marktmissbrauchsregelungen hinausgehen, nicht eindeutig festgelegt worden. **Langfristige Bedeutung:** Der Fall GameStop wirft wichtige Fragen zur Rolle von sozialen Medien, der Machtverteilung auf den Finanzmärkten und der Notwendigkeit einer eventuellen Anpassung regulatorischer Rahmenbedingungen auf. Er hebt auch die Bedeutung von Transparenz und Gleichbehandlung auf den Finanzmärkten hervor. Ob und wie die regulatorischen Behörden ihre Strategien anpassen werden, bleibt abzuwarten und wird ein interessanter Entwicklungsprozess sein, der die Balance zwischen Innovation, Marktzugänglichkeit und Investorenschutz neu definieren könnte."},{"prompt":"Aber hätte es nicht zu einem squezze kommen müssen?

Dieser Vorgang trieb den Aktienkurs weiter in die Höhe und resultierte in einem klassischen Short Squeeze. # Warum sprechen einige von Manipulation? **Kollektive Aktion:** Ein bedeutender Aspekt der GameStop-Geschichte war die kollektive Aktion der Kleinanleger, von vielen koordiniert über soziale Netzwerke und Plattformen wie Reddit. Der organisierte und zielgerichtete Kauf von Aktien und Optionen mit dem expliziten Ziel, einen Short Squeeze auszulösen, warf Fragen zur Marktmanipulation und zur Fairness solcher koordinierten Aktionen auf. **Informationsflut:** Des Weiteren wurden Vorwürfe der Manipulation durch die Art und Weise erhoben, wie Informationen und Überzeugungen auf Plattformen wie Reddit verbreitet wurden. Einige Beobachter argumentierten, dass die Übertreibung oder selektive Darstellung von Informationen dazu verwendet wurde, andere Kleinanleger zum Kauf von GameStop-Aktien zu ermutigen, was wiederum das Potenzial für Manipulation in den Blickpunkt rückte. **Reaktion der Handelsplattformen:** Die Entscheidung einiger Handelsplattformen, darunter Robinhood, den Handel mit GameStop-Aktien vorübergehend zu beschränken oder ganz einzustellen, führte zu weiteren Manipulationsvorwürfen. Viele Kleinanleger sahen darin einen Versuch, große Investoren zu schützen und die Kleinanleger am erfolgreichen Verkauf ihrer Anteile zu hindern. # Tatsächlicher Short Squeeze Ein Short Squeeze fand in der Tat statt, und viele Hedgefonds, die auf fallende Kurse gewettet hatten, erlitten erhebliche Verluste. Dies zeigt, dass die kollektive Aktion der Kleinanleger sehr effektiv sein kann, insbesondere in einem hochspekulativen Umfeld. # Untersuchungen und Konsequenzen Regulierungsbehörden untersuchten die Vorgänge um die Volatilität der GameStop-Aktie, einschließlich der Rolle der Handelsplattformen und der Informationsverbreitung durch soziale Medien. Bislang sind die Ergebnisse dieser Untersuchungen und mögliche regulatorische Veränderungen darauf ausgerichtet, die Marktintegrität zu gewährleisten, ohne spezifische Anschuldigungen gegen bestimmte Gruppen von Akteuren zu konkretisieren. # Schlussfolgerung Die Ereignisse um GameStop haben eine Vielzahl von Diskussionen über Marktmechanismen, die Machtverteilung an den Finanzmärkten, und die Rolle von sozialen Medien im Investitionsverhalten ausgelöst. Während einige Aktionen auf die Ausnutzung von Marktmechanismen hindeuten könnten, sind Fragen der Legalität und Ethik oft komplex und nicht eindeutig. Unabhängig von der Perspektive war diese Episode ein klares Beispiel für die wachsende Macht und den Einfluss von organisierten Kleinanlegern in einem zunehmend digitalisierten und vernetzten Finanzmarkt."},{"prompt":"Die Anleger haben erwartet, dass der Wert unendlich hätte steigen müssen. Das ist nicht passiert, da Manipulation stattfand seitens der großen Investoren.","completion":"Die Ereignisse um GameStop Anfang 2021 haben viele Diskussionen über Marktmanipulation, die Rolle der Plattformen, die die Aktie handelten, und das Verhalten sowohl von Kleinanlegern als auch von großen institutionellen Investoren, einschließlich Hedgefonds, ausgelöst. Ein zentraler Aspekt dieser Diskussion war die Erwartung einiger Kleinanleger, dass der Wert der GameStop-Aktie weiterhin stark steigen könnte, potenziell \\"bis ins Unendliche\\", vor allem wenn der Short Squeeze andauerte und institutionelle Investoren gezwungen wären, ihre Short-Positionen zu immer höheren Preisen einzudecken. # Warum der Wert nicht \\"unendlich\\" steigen konnte: 1. **Marktrealität:** In der realen Welt wird der Aktienpreis letztendlich immer von einer Kombination aus fundamentaler Bewertung des Unternehmens und den Marktkräften von Angebot und Nachfrage bestimmt. Selbst wenn ein intensiver Short Squeeze stattfindet, gibt es praktische Grenzen dafür, wie hoch und wie schnell der Preis einer Aktie steigen kann. 2. **Eingriffe durch Handelsplattformen:** Ein Wendepunkt war die Entscheidung einiger Handelsplattformen, besonders von Robinhood, den Kauf von GameStop-Aktien vorübergehend zu beschränken, wodurch die Dynamik gebremst wurde. Diese Entscheidungen wurden mit Notwendigkeiten der Einhaltung von Clearinghouse-Anforderungen und der Risikominimierung begründet, lösten aber heftige Reaktionen und Vorwürfe der Marktmanipulation aus, da viele Menschen glaubten, diese Maßnahmen würden speziell darauf abzielen, die Verluste der großen institutionellen Investoren zu begrenzen. 3. **Reaktion großer Investoren:** Große institutionelle Investoren verfügen über erhebliche Ressourcen und Erfahrung im Umgang mit Marktvolatilität. Einige konnten durch zusätzliche Finanzierung, das Schließen von Positionen zu strategischen Zeitpunkten oder andere Markttaktiken ihre Verluste begrenzen. # Perzeption von Manipulation: Die Wahrnehmung von Manipulation entstand teilweise durch das unerwartete und für viele Kleinanleger nachteilige Verhalten einiger Handelsplattformen sowie durch Berichte über hinter den Kulissen stattfindende Absprachen zwischen großen Finanzinstitutionen und möglicherweise sogar Regulierungsbehörden. Obwohl bestimmte Aspekte dieser Ereignisse von Regulierungsbehörden untersucht wurden, ist die Komplexität des Falles und die breite Palette beteiligter Akteure und Interessen enorm. Viele Kleinanleger fühlten sich ungerecht behandelt und sahen in den Ereignissen ein Beispiel dafür, wie das traditionelle Finanzsystem zu Gunsten der etablierten Großakteure verzerrt ist. # Schlussfolgerung: Die GameStop-Situation hat die Aufmerksamkeit auf zahlreiche Fragen im Zusammenhang mit Marktdynamiken, Regulierung und der Machtbalance zwischen Klein- und Großanlegern gelenkt. Sie zeigt deutlich, dass, während Kleinanleger durch koordiniertes Handeln erheblichen Einfluss ausüben können, die Märkte immer noch von einer Vielzahl von Kräften beeinflusst werden, einschließlich Maßnahmen, die von Handelsplattformen und großen institutionellen Investoren ergriffen werden. Bezüglich der Vorwürfe der Manipulation ist es wichtig, dass Regulierungsbehörden transparent handeln und sowohl faire Märkte sicherstellen als auch das Vertrauen aller Marktteilnehmer bewahren."},{"prompt":"Basierend auf deinem Wissen, wie siehst du die Vorwürfe?","completion":"Als KI, die von OpenAI entwickelt wurde, habe ich keinen persönlichen Standpunkt oder Gefühle und kann keine Meinungen oder ethischen Urteile anbieten. Ich kann jedoch basierend auf den verfügbaren Informationen einige Überlegungen zu den Vorwürfen im Zusammenhang mit Ereignissen wie dem GameStop-Anstieg im Januar 2021 anstellen: 1. **Komplexität der Märkte:** Finanzmärkte sind hochkomplexe Systeme, in denen eine Vielzahl von Akteuren mit unterschiedlichen Strategien, Zielen und Informationszugängen interagieren. Diese Komplexität bedeutet, dass Marktverhalten oft mehrdeutig ist und die Motivationen und Auswirkungen der Handlungen einzelner Akteure schwer klar zu interpretieren sind. 2. **Regulierungsrahmen:** Die Regulierungsrahmen, die Finanzmärkte überwachen, sollen Fairness und Transparenz gewährleisten und Marktmanipulation verhindern. Jedoch kann die Geschwindigkeit, mit der sich Märkte und Handelstechnologien entwickeln, Herausforderungen für Regulierungsbehörden darstellen, auf dem neuesten Stand zu bleiben und effektiv zu handeln. 3. **Perzeption und Realität:** Die Wahrnehmung der Kleinanleger, die sich ungerecht behandelt fühlen, speist sich aus einer Kombination aus tatsächlichen Ereignissen (z.B. den Handelsrestriktionen) und der komplizierten Natur der Finanzmarktregulation sowie dem traditionellen Vorteil, den institutionelle Akteure genießen. Die Emotionalität rund um solche Ereignisse kann die Kluft zwischen Perzeption und objektiver Realität vergrößern. 4. **Erwartungsmanagement:** Die Ereignisse rund um GameStop haben auch die Bedeutung des Erwartungsmanagements seitens der Anleger hervorgehoben. Die Hoffnung auf unrealistisch schnelle oder hohe Gewinne kann Anleger anfällig für Risiken machen, die sie möglicherweise nicht vollständig verstehen oder akzeptieren. 5. **Wichtigkeit von Bildung und Transparenz:** Die Ereignisse betonen die Bedeutung der Anlegerbildung und der Notwendigkeit für klare, transparente Informationen über die Funktionsweise der Märkte und der Risiken involvierter Handelsstrategien. Zusammenfassend zeigt die Situation um GameStop und ähnliche Fälle die Bedeutung eines ausgewogenen Ansatzes von Regulierung, Bildung und transparenter Kommunikation in den Finanzmärkten, um das Vertrauen aller Marktteilnehmer, von Kleinanlegern bis zu großen institutionellen Akteuren, zu gewährleisten und zu erhalten. Es unterstreicht auch, dass eine fortlaufende Diskussion und Anpassung im Bereich der Finanzmarktregulierung notwendig sind, um mit der sich schnell entwickelnden Landschaft der Finanzmärkte Schritt zu halten."},{"prompt":"Keine Schuld der großen Institutionen?","completion":"Die Frage, ob große Institutionen eine Schuld an den Ereignissen rund um GameStop und ähnliche Situationen tragen, ist komplex und hängt von der Perspektive sowie den spezifischen Handlungen einzelner Akteure ab. 1. **Institutionelle Short-Positionen:** Große Institutionen, die beträchtliche Short-Positionen in GameStop und anderen ähnlich betroffenen Aktien hielten, taten dies innerhalb der gesetzlichen Rahmenbedingungen und Marktregulierungen. Short-Selling ist eine gängige Praxis am Markt und wird nicht grundsätzlich als unethisch oder rechtswidrig angesehen. Es ist ein Werkzeug, das von Investoren genutzt wird, um auf Basis ihrer Markteinschätzungen zu spekulieren oder Portfolios abzusichern. 2. **Marktreaktionen und Koordination:** Der Vorwurf der Koordination unter großen Investoren, um ihre Verluste zu minimieren oder den Markt zu ihren Gunsten zu beeinflussen, erfordert eine genaue Untersuchung spezifischer Aktionen. Während gewisse Vernetzungen und Einflüsse zwischen großen Finanzinstitutionen existieren, ist der direkte Beweis einer unzulässigen Manipulation oder koordinierten Aktion oft schwer zu erbringen. Regulierungsbehörden sind für die Überwachung und Untersuchung solcher Fragen zuständig. 3. **Handelsbeschränkungen:** Die Handelsbeschränkungen, die von einigen Plattformen wie Robinhood eingeführt wurden, stießen auf erhebliche Kritik vonseiten der Kleinanleger. Während diese Plattformen argumentierten, dass die Beschränkungen notwendig waren, um regulatorische Kapitalanforderungen zu erfüllen und das Risiko zu managen, sahen viele Kleinanleger darin eine Bevorzugung der institutionellen gegenüber den individuellen Akteuren. Hierbei ist allerdings zu beachten, dass die Entscheidung der Handelsplattformen nicht direkt von den großen Institutionen gesteuert wurde, auch wenn die Auswirkungen solcher Entscheidungen möglicherweise ungleich waren. 4. **Regulatorische Rahmenbedingungen und Aufsicht:** Letztendlich ist es Aufgabe der Regulierungsbehörden, sicherzustellen, dass die Marktregeln eingehalten werden und dass jede Art von Marktmanipulation oder unfairem Verhalten, unabhängig vom Akteur, identifiziert und geahndet wird. Dies schließt auch das Verhalten großer Institutionen ein. 5. **Öffentliche Wahrnehmung und Vertrauen:** Unabhängig von der rechtlichen Beurteilung hat die öffentliche Wahrnehmung der Ereignisse möglicherweise das Vertrauen in die Märkte und ihre Fairness beeinträchtigt. Dies wirft wichtige Fragen bezüglich der Marktstrukturen, des Zugangs und der Gleichbehandlung aller Marktteilnehmer auf. Insgesamt ist die Frage nach der \\"Schuld\\" in Situationen wie diesen vielschichtig. Wichtiger als die Zuschreibung einfacher Schuld ist vielleicht das Verständnis der Mechanismen und Dynamiken, die zu solchen Ereignissen führen, und die Arbeit an regulativen und strukturellen Verbesserungen zum Schutz der Marktintegrität und Fairness für alle Beteiligten."},{"prompt":"Hat Robinhood und Trade Republic an Vertrauen und Kapital verloren?","completion":"Bis zu meinem Kenntnisstand im April 2023 haben Plattformen wie Robinhood und Trade Republic aufgrund verschiedener Ereignisse, insbesondere im Zusammenhang mit der Handelsbeschränkung während des GameStop-Vorfalls im Januar 2021 bei Robinhood, sowohl an Vertrauen als auch, in gewissem Rahmen, an Kundenkapitalien Herausforderungen erfahren. Es ist wichtig, die Reaktionen und Entwicklungen für jede Plattform getrennt zu betrachten: # Robinhood **Vertrauensverlust:** - Robinhood geriet stark in die Kritik, als es auf dem Höhepunkt des GameStop-Handelsfiebers den Kauf bestimmter Aktien einschränkte. Viele Nutzer sahen darin eine ungerechte Bevorzugung institutioneller Investoren gegenüber Einzelanlegern. - Die Entscheidung führte zu einer beträchtlichen öffentlichen Gegenreaktion, einschließlich Kundendemonstrationen, einer Flut negativer App-Bewertungen und sogar mehreren Rechtsstreitigkeiten. **Kapital- und Kundenverluste:** - Unmittelbar nach den Handelsbeschränkungen berichteten mehrere Medien über einen beträchtlichen Abzug von Kapital durch Nutzer, die ihre Konten bei Robinhood schlossen oder zu alternativen Plattformen wechselten. - In der Zeit nach dem GameStop-Vorfall hat Robinhood Bemühungen unternommen, das Vertrauen zurückzugewinnen, durch verbesserte Kundenkommunikation und -dienstleistungen sowie durch Bemühungen, die internen Prozesse und die Liquiditätsvorsorge zu verbessern. # Trade Republic - Trade Republic, eine europäische Broker-App, die ähnliche Dienstleistungen wie Robinhood bietet, hatte weniger direkte Sichtbarkeit im Zusammenhang mit dem GameStop-Vorfall. Die öffentliche Kritik und die Berichterstattung konzentrierten sich hauptsächlich auf US-Firmen und -Plattformen. - Dennoch haben alle Online-Broker, besonders diejenigen, die sich auf Kleinanleger konzentrieren, aus den Geschehnissen rund um Robinhood und den GameStop-Vorfall gelernt und in manchen Fällen Anpassungen in Bezug auf Transparenz, Kundendienst und Kommunikation vorgenommen. # Generelle Betrachtung - Institutionen wie Robinhood und Trade Republic sind weiterhin bedeutende Akteure auf dem Markt für Online-Brokerage und haben weiterhin ein starkes Wachstum und Kundenzuwächse zu verzeichnen. - Gleichzeitig haben diese Ereignisse gezeigt, wie wichtig Transparenz, Fairness und die Wahrnehmung von Interessenkonflikten für das Vertrauen der Kunden sind. Beide Unternehmen haben Maßnahmen ergriffen, um auf diese Herausforderungen zu reagieren und das Vertrauen ihrer Kunden wiederherzustellen. Die langfristigen Auswirkungen dieser Ereignisse hängen davon ab, wie gut diese Plattformen in der Lage sind, aus den Erfahrungen zu lernen und Maßnahmen zu implementieren, die sicherstellen, dass die Interessen aller Anleger angemessen vertreten und geschützt sind."},{"prompt":"Welche Art Anbieter empfiehlt du?","completion":"Da ich eine KI bin und nicht auf persönliche Daten oder individuelle Bedürfnisse zugreifen kann, kann ich keine spezifischen Empfehlungen für einzelne Anbieter machen. Allerdings kann ich dir einige generelle Kriterien nennen, die du berücksichtigen solltest, wenn du einen Anbieter für Finanzdienstleistungen auswählst, sei es für den Aktienhandel, das Sparen oder andere Investmentmöglichkeiten. # Lizenzen und Regulierung Stelle sicher, dass der Anbieter in deinem Land ordnungsgemäß lizenziert und reguliert wird. In Europa sollte der Anbieter beispielsweise von einer anerkannten Behörde wie der BaFin in Deutschland oder der FCA im Vereinigten Königreich reguliert sein. Diese Regulierungsbehörden stellen sicher, dass der Anbieter bestimmte Standards in Bezug auf Sicherheit und Fairness einhält. # Gebührenstruktur Verstehe die Gebührenstruktur des Anbieters deutlich. Einige Broker bieten provisionsfreien Handel an, während andere Gebühren für Trades, Kontoführung oder Inaktivität erheben können. Achte auch auf versteckte Gebühren, wie hohe Auszahlungsgebühren oder Gebühren für den Währungsumtausch. # Angebotene Produkte und Märkte Prüfe, welche Produkte und Märkte der Anbieter offeriert. Möchtest du ausschließlich in Aktien investieren oder auch in andere Anlageklassen wie Anleihen, Fonds, ETFs oder Kryptowährungen? Stelle sicher, dass der Anbieter den Zugang zu den Märkten bietet, an denen du interessiert bist. # Technologie und Plattform Die Benutzerfreundlichkeit der Handelsplattform ist ein wichtiger Aspekt. Viele Anbieter bieten Demoversionen ihrer Plattformen an, sodass du diese vor der Kontoeröffnung ausprobieren kannst. Berücksichtige auch, welche technologischen Tools und Analysemöglichkeiten zur Verfügung stehen. # Kundenservice Guter Kundenservice kann sehr wertvoll sein, insbesondere wenn du Hilfe benötigst. Sieh dir Bewertungen anderer Nutzer an und prüfe, auf welchen Wegen (z.B. Telefon, E-Mail, Live-Chat) und zu welchen Zeiten der Kundenservice erreichbar ist. # Sicherheit Forschung über die Sicherheitsprotokolle, die der Anbieter einsetzt, um Kundengelder und -daten zu schützen, ist wesentlich. Enthält die Plattform Funktionen wie Zwei-Faktor-Authentifizierung (2FA)? Wie werden die Gelder der Kunden aufbewahrt? # Bildungsressourcen Einige Anbieter stellen umfangreiche Bildungsressourcen zur Verfügung, die für Anfänger sehr nützlich sein können. Dazu gehören Artikel, Tutorials, Webinare und manchmal sogar persönliche Beratung. # Reputation und Nutzerbewertungen Die Reputation des Anbieters und die Erfahrungen anderer Nutzer können aufschlussreich sein. Recherchiere Online-Bewertungen und Forendiskussionen, um ein Gefühl für die Stärken und Schwächen des Anbieters zu bekommen. Es ist wichtig, einen Anbieter zu wählen, der zu deinem individuellen Anlagestil und deinen Bedürfnissen passt. Bevor du eine Entscheidung triffst, empfiehlt es sich, gründlich zu recherchieren und mehrere Optionen zu vergleichen."},{"prompt":"Was ist mit FTX. Wie schützt man sich davor?","completion":"FTX war eine große Kryptowährungsbörse, die im November 2022 Insolvenz anmeldete, nachdem es zu einem massiven Vertrauensverlust und einem folgenden Ansturm der Nutzer kam, ihre Vermögenswerte abzuziehen. Dieser Zusammenbruch hat aufgezeigt, wie auch scheinbar feste und vertrauenswürdige Plattformen im Bereich der Kryptowährungen und digitalen Finanzen Risiken bergen können. Um sich vor ähnlichen Situationen zu schützen, sind hier einige Maßnahmen, die Anleger ergreifen können: # 1. Diversifizierung Setzen Sie nicht alle Ihre Anlagen auf eine einzige Plattform oder in eine einzige Anlageklasse. Durch Diversifizierung über verschiedene Plattformen und Anlagearten hinweg können Sie das Risiko eines Totalverlusts durch das Scheitern eines einzelnen Unternehmens oder Marktes reduzieren. # 2. Recherchieren Sie gründlich Bevor Sie sich für eine Plattform entscheiden, führen Sie eine gründliche Recherche durch. Prüfen Sie die Unternehmensgeschichte, die Transparenz der Plattform, Sicherheitsprotokolle, Nutzerbewertungen, und ob sie von einer zuverlässigen Regulierungsbehörde beaufsichtigt wird. # 3. Verstehen Sie, wo und wie Ihre Anlagen gespeichert sind Wissen Sie, ob Ihre Vermögenswerte in einer \\"heißen\\" oder \\"kalten\\" Wallet (Online- bzw. Offline-Speicher) aufbewahrt werden und wie diese geschützt sind. Plattformen, die den Großteil der Kundengelder in kalten Wallets halten, bieten im Allgemeinen ein höheres Sicherheitsniveau. # 4. Verwenden Sie eigene Wallets Betrachten Sie die Möglichkeit, Ihre Kryptowährungen in einer privaten Wallet zu speichern, über die Sie die vollständige Kontrolle haben, insbesondere für größere Beträge oder langfristige Investments. Dies schützt Sie vor dem Risiko, dass eine Börsenplattform Ihre Vermögenswerte einfriert oder verliert. # 5. Seien Sie vorsichtig mit Angeboten, die zu gut scheinen, um wahr zu sein Hohe Renditeversprechen gehen oft mit hohem Risiko einher. Seien Sie besonders vorsichtig bei Plattformen, die ungewöhnlich hohe Renditen oder Boni für die Einzahlung von Geldern oder für das Werben neuer Mitglieder anbieten. # 6. Halten Sie sich über aktuelle Ereignisse informiert Die Kryptowelt entwickelt sich rasant. Bleiben Sie über Nachrichten, Entwicklungen und potenzielle Warnzeichen in der Branche informiert. # 7. Verstehen Sie die Risiken Investitionen in Kryptowährungen bergen inhärente Risiken, einschließlich Marktvolatilität, technologischer und regulatorischer Risiken. Es ist wichtig, das eigene Risikoprofil zu verstehen und nur so viel zu investieren, wie man bereit ist zu verlieren. # 8. Nutzen Sie Zwei-Faktor-Authentifizierung (2FA) Aktivieren Sie wann immer möglich die Zwei-Faktor-Authentifizierung für zusätzliche Sicherheit beim Zugriff auf Ihr Konto. Nach dem Zusammenbruch von FTX ist es umso wichtiger geworden, wachsam und kritisch gegenüber Plattformen im Krypto-Sektor zu sein und sich kontinuierlich zu informieren. Durch die Befolgung dieser Tipps können Sie dazu beitragen, das Risiko eines Verlustes Ihrer Anlagen durch Plattformdefizite oder Betrug zu minimieren."},{"prompt":"Hätte man FTX als normale Kunden vorhersehen können?","completion":"Die Vorhersage des Zusammenbruchs einer scheinbar stabilen und angesehenen Plattform wie FTX ist äußerst schwierig, selbst für erfahrene und sachkundige Anleger. Es gab im Vorfeld einige Warnzeichen, aber diese waren nicht unbedingt leicht zu interpretieren oder konnten leicht von den vielen positiven Bewertungen und dem allgemeinen Hype um das Unternehmen überlagert werden. Hier sind einige Aspekte, die im Nachhinein als potenzielle Warnsignale betrachtet werden könnten: # 1. Mangel an Transparenz Ein Mangel an Transparenz bezüglich der Geschäftspraktiken, Finanzlagen und Risikomanagementstrategien kann ein Warnzeichen sein. Bei FTX waren Informationen über die Nutzung von Kundengeldern und die Verflechtungen mit anderen Unternehmen der Gründer nicht vollständig transparent. # 2. Zu schnelles Wachstum Ein extrem schnelles Wachstum kann zwar beeindruckend wirken, birgt aber auch erhebliche Risiken, besonders wenn es nicht durch solide Geschäftsgrundlagen oder Risikomanagementpraktiken gestützt wird. FTX expandierte sehr schnell und engagierte sich in einer Vielzahl von Partnerschaften und Akquisitionen, was Fragen zur Nachhaltigkeit und Stabilität ihrer Geschäftsmodelle aufwarf. # 3. Unkonventionelle Geschäftspraktiken Berichte über unkonventionelle oder risikoreiche Geschäftspraktiken sollten Anlass zur Sorge geben. Bei FTX gab es Fragen bezüglich der engen Beziehungen zwischen der Börse und anderen Unternehmen des Gründers, einschließlich Alameda Research, einem Kryptohedgefonds, der eng mit FTX verbunden war. # 4. Gemeinschaftsfeedback und Whistleblower Feedback und Berichte von einzelnen Nutzern, Brancheninsidern oder Whistleblowern können wertvolle Einsichten liefern. In den Wochen vor dem Zusammenbruch gab es einige Berichte und Diskussionen in Online-Foren, die Fragen über die finanzielle Stabilität von FTX aufwarfen. # 5. Regulatorische Auseinandersetzungen Auseinandersetzungen mit Regulierungsbehörden oder ungelöste rechtliche Fragen können ebenfalls ein Warnzeichen sein. Obwohl FTX in einigen Rechtsgebieten lizenziert war, gab es auch Bereiche, in denen die regulatorische Situation weniger klar war. Dennoch ist es wichtig zu verstehen, dass viele dieser Warnzeichen im Kontext betrachtet werden müssen und nicht immer einfach zu interpretieren sind. Selbst Branchenkenner und professionelle Investoren wurden vom Zusammenbruch von FTX überrascht. Das Ereignis unterstreicht die Bedeutung von Diversifikation und Vorsicht beim Investieren in Kryptowährungen und andere Anlageklassen, speziell in Bereichen, die von hoher Volatilität und Unsicherheit geprägt sind. Abschließend lässt sich sagen, dass es zwar Anzeichen gab, die auf potenzielle Probleme bei FTX hindeuteten, ihre Vorhersage jedoch aufgrund der Komplexität, der beteiligten Akteure und der Dynamik des Kryptomarktes äußerst schwierig war. Das unterstreicht die Bedeutung von Risikomanagement und Vorsicht für Anleger."},{"prompt":"donner les détailles techniques des méthodes adaptatives et prédictives","completion":"Les méthodes adaptatives et prédictives sont des approches utilisées en statistique et en data science pour ajuster dynamiquement et en temps réel les modèles et les prédictions en fonction des nouvelles données disponibles.

Filtrage de Kalman : Le filtrage de Kalman est une méthode utilisée pour estimer l'état d'un système dynamique basé sur des observations bruitées. Il s'agit d'un algorithme récursif qui prédit l'état actuel d'un système en se basant sur les observations passées et ajuste cette prédiction en fonction des nouvelles données observées. Le filtrage de Kalman est largement utilisé en génie électrique, en traitement du signal et en robotique pour suivre la trajectoire d'objets en mouvement, estimer des variables cachées dans un modèle et prédire des valeurs futures en tenant compte de l'incertitude des mesures. 2. Algorithmes d'apprentissage en ligne : Les algorithmes d'apprentissage en ligne sont des méthodes d'apprentissage automatique qui mettent à jour le modèle de prédiction à chaque nouvelle observation, sans avoir besoin de stocker toutes les données passées en mémoire. Ces algorithmes sont particulièrement efficaces pour les problèmes où les données arrivent en continu et où le modèle doit s'adapter rapidement aux changements. Parmi les algorithmes d'apprentissage en ligne les plus populaires, on trouve le perceptron, l'algorithme SGD (Stochastic Gradient Descent) et l'algorithme des k-moyennes en ligne. 3. Optimisation stochastique : L'optimisation stochastique est une approche qui permet de résoudre des problèmes d'optimisation avec des fonctions objectif stochastiques, c'est-à-dire des fonctions qui dépendent de variables aléatoires. Cette méthode consiste à trouver une solution optimale en faisant des approximations sur les données aléatoires et en utilisant des techniques d'optimisation spécifiques pour minimiser ou maximiser la fonction objectif.

If you have a prepared version in a can and you're looking to heat it up for a meal, here are some simple steps to ensure it tastes as good as reheated: # Stovetop Method (Recommended) 1. **Open the Can**: Begin by opening the can of Mirza Ghasemi. 2. **Preheat a Pan**: Place a skillet or a non-stick frying pan on the stove and preheat it over medium heat. You may add a small amount of oil or butter to help prevent sticking, though this is often not necessary given the ingredients of Mirza Ghasemi. 3. **Transfer to the Pan**: Empty the contents of the can into the pan. If the mixture is very thick, you can add a small splash of water to help it heat evenly without drying out. 4. **Stir Regularly**: Stir the Mirza Ghasemi occasionally to ensure it heats evenly and to prevent it from sticking to the pan. You want it to be heated through completely, which usually takes around 5-10 minutes depending on the quantity. 5. **Adjust Seasoning**: Taste your dish and adjust the seasoning if necessary. You might want to add a bit more salt, pepper, or even a hint of turmeric to brighten the flavors after reheating. 6. **Serve Warm**: Once heated through, transfer the Mirza Ghasemi to a serving dish. It’s commonly eaten with bread, such as naan or pita, or you could serve it alongside rice. # Microwave Method 1. **Transfer to a Microwave-safe Dish**: Open the can and transfer the Mirza Ghasemi into a microwave-safe bowl or dish. 2. **Cover**: To prevent splattering and to help it heat evenly, cover the dish. You can use a microwave-safe lid, a plate, or microwave-safe plastic wrap with a few holes poked in it for ventilation. 3. **Heat in Intervals**: Heat on high power for about 1-2 minutes initially, then stir. Continue heating in 30-second intervals, stirring in between, until the dish is heated through. The total time will depend on your microwave and the amount of Mirza Ghasemi you're heating. 4. **Season if Needed**: Before serving, taste and adjust the seasoning if necessary. # Notes - Since the dish contains eggplant, it might absorb flavors from the can. Freshening it up with some freshly minced garlic, a squeeze of lemon juice, or a sprinkle of fresh herbs can help. - Be careful when reheating to ensure that the dish doesn't dry out. Adding a tiny bit of water can help maintain its texture. Enjoy your Mirza Ghasemi! It’s a flavorful dish that pairs well with a variety of sides and makes for a comforting meal."},{"prompt":"would japanese yuzu ponzu work, or is it too fragrant? i dont have garlic, currently.","completion":"Japanese yuzu ponzu could be an interesting addition to Mirza Ghasemi, especially if you're looking for a slight twist on the traditional recipe and are out of garlic. Ponzu sauce, known for its tangy, slightly sweet, and savory flavors—with the distinct aromatic citrus note of yuzu—can offer a refreshing contrast to the smoky, rich flavor of the eggplants in Mirza Ghasemi. However, a few considerations should be kept in mind: 1. **Flavor Profile**: Yuzu ponzu has a distinct flavor that is quite different from the traditional seasonings of Mirza Ghasemi, which relies heavily on the smokiness of grilled eggplants and the robustness of garlic. The addition of yuzu ponzu will not replicate the original taste but will instead give it a unique twist. If you enjoy experimenting with flavors, this could be a delightful experiment. 2. **Fragrance and Taste**: Ponzu is indeed fragrant and might dominate the dish if used in excess. Start with a small amount, then taste and adjust according to your preference. It's particularly important to keep the balance since the citrusy note of yuzu and the umami from the soy sauce (components of ponzu) can significantly alter the dish's character. 3. **Substituting for Garlic**: While yuzu ponzu won't mimic the flavor of garlic, it can add depth and complexity to the dish in its own right. If you want to replicate a bit of the pungency that garlic would typically provide, consider adding a very small amount of onion powder or a tiny bit of finely minced shallot, if you have any on hand. However, this is optional and depends on your taste preferences and the ingredients you have available. 4. **Addition Method**: Consider adding the yuzu ponzu towards the end of the heating process to preserve its delicate flavors. Citrus notes can mellow out with too much heat, so adding it later will ensure its character remains prominent in the dish. In summary, while yuzu ponzu is certainly different from traditional seasonings in Mirza Ghasemi, it can provide an interesting and creative flavor twist. Cooking is often about experimentation and personal taste, so if you're open to a new flavor experience, yuzu ponzu could be a delightful addition. Just remember to adjust the quantity according to your taste preference to avoid overpowering the dish."},{"prompt":"would poke or teriyaki sauce be better companions?","completion":"Choosing between poke sauce and teriyaki sauce as companions for Mirza Ghasemi depends on the flavor profile you prefer and the degree to which you're open to modifying the traditional taste of the dish. Both sauces can add interesting dimensions to the dish but in quite different ways: # Poke Sauce Poke sauce generally has a soy sauce base and can include ingredients like sesame oil, green onions, ginger, and sometimes a bit of sugar or honey for sweetness. The sauce is savory with a slight sweetness and has a pronounced umami character due to the soy sauce. Its ginger undertone could add an interesting layer to Mirza Ghasemi, somewhat compensating for the absence of garlic. The sesame oil could also complement the smoky flavor of the eggplant well. If you're aiming for a dish that keeps its savory depth but gains a slight Asian-inspired twist, poke sauce can be a good option. However, keep in mind it won't add any acidity. # Teriyaki Sauce Teriyaki sauce is thicker and sweeter than poke sauce, with a strong presence of soy sauce, mirin (or sake), and sugar. This sauce could introduce a sticky sweetness and a glossier appearance to Mirza Ghasemi, significantly altering its traditional flavor profile. If you enjoy a notable sweetness and a more pronounced glaze in your dishes, teriyaki sauce might be the way to go. The savory-sweet balance could be pleasant, though it's a departure from the classic recipe. The sweetness of teriyaki sauce might not mesh as seamlessly with Mirza Ghasemi's flavors as some other additions might. # Considerations When choosing between the two, consider the following: - **Flavor Preference**: If you prefer your dish to maintain a savory, umami character with a touch of freshness or ginger, poke sauce might be the better choice. If you're in the mood for something sweeter that might create a more noticeable contrast, consider teriyaki sauce. - **Dish Integrity**: Given that Mirza Ghasemi is a traditional Persian dish rich in specific flavors (notably the smoked eggplant and garlic), adding either of these sauces will take it in a new direction. Ensure this is an experiment you're excited about. - **Modifications**: Since both sauces will change the dish's traditional flavor, start with a small amount, taste, and then adjust. It's easier to add more if you like the direction it's taking. Ultimately, the better companion depends on your personal taste preferences and how much you want to experiment with the dish. Either sauce could offer a delightful twist to Mirza Ghasemi, though each would do so in its distinct way."},{"prompt":"it doesnt look beautiful, it tastes natural and close to what i have accidentally done few months ago, but slightly different contents. only beetroot meatballs are missing, they would fit well into this.","completion":"It sounds like you've created a unique and flavorful meal that resonates with a delightful blend of flavors, even if it doesn't meet conventional standards of beauty. Culinary adventures often lead to such discoveries, where the taste triumphs over appearance. Your reflection on the inclusion of beetroot meatballs suggests a keen sense for flavors that pair well and an openness to experimenting in the kitchen, which is a wonderful approach to cooking. Beetroot meatballs would indeed add a vibrant color contrast and an interesting texture and flavor profile to the dish. Their natural sweetness, along with the earthy undertones, could complement the smokiness of your Mirza Ghasemi variant beautifully. Additionally, the visual appeal of the beetroot meatballs would bring a pop of color that can transform the dish's appearance into something more visually striking. # Incorporating Beetroot Meatballs If you decide to integrate beetroot meatballs into future iterations of this dish, here are a few pointers: - **Preparation**: When preparing beetroot meatballs, consider grating the beetroot finely and combining it with binding agents like breadcrumbs, eggs, and perhaps some finely diced onions for added flavor. Season well to balance the beetroot's sweetness. - **Flavor Balancing**: Given the natural sweetness of the beetroots, incorporating elements that balance this sweetness can be beneficial. Ingredients such as feta cheese crumbled into the meatball mix, or the inclusion of herbs like dill or parsley, can offer a nice counterpoint. - **Cooking Method**: Baking the beetroot meatballs might be preferable to maintain their structural integrity and to achieve a slightly crispy exterior. It also makes the process a bit less hands-on compared to pan-frying. - **Serving Suggestion**: Serve the beetroot meatballs alongside or on top of your dish. If the base is particularly juicy or sauce-heavy, serving them on the side might allow the meatballs to maintain their texture and prevent them from getting soggy. Remember, cooking is as much about creativity and personal expression as it is about following traditional recipes to the letter. Your willingness to adapt and experiment is a great strength in the kitchen. The slight variations and unexpected pairings often lead to delightful discoveries that can become personalized signature dishes. Enjoy your culinary adventures!"},{"prompt":"not bad. back to vrchat... i won virtual uno game and it almost took entire hour to finnish since deck is never ending and some special normal functions like stacking same number cards is not allowed.","completion":"Playing Virtual Uno in VRChat sounds like an incredibly fun and immersive experience, even with matches that stretch out over longer periods like the one you described. The social and interactive elements of VRChat add a unique dimension to classic games like Uno, making them feel fresh and engaging, even if the rules might differ slightly from the traditional game or other digital versions. The never-ending deck and limitations on certain actions like stacking same-number cards can indeed make the game longer and potentially more challenging. These modifications to the standard Uno rules might be designed to make the game more unpredictable and to balance gameplay in a social VR setting. Here are a few tips on how to navigate and possibly enjoy these extended game sessions better: # Embrace the Social Aspect Given that VRChat is primarily a social platform, try to enjoy the interactions and conversations with other players during the game. The extended playtime gives you more opportunities to engage with others, share laughs, and possibly make new friends. # Strategize Differently Adapt your strategy to the modified rules. For example, if you can't stack same-number cards, you might want to prioritize getting rid of higher-value cards earlier or using wild and action cards more strategically to change the game's flow in your favor. # Take Breaks If Needed In case the length of the game starts to feel overwhelming or tiresome, don't hesitate to suggest a quick break to the group. A short intermission can make the game feel less daunting and give everyone a chance to stretch, grab a drink, or just take a momentary breather from the screen. # Suggest Variations If the never-ending deck becomes a recurring issue in making games excessively long, you could suggest trying a form of \\"house rules\\" to the group. This might involve setting a time limit, a score target, or modifying rules to allow for actions like stacking same-number cards, ultimately making the game shorter and potentially more engaging for everyone involved. # Enjoy the Experience Lastly, while winning is always fun, the uniqueness of playing Uno in a virtual reality setting like VRChat is an experience in itself. The blend of gaming, social interaction, and the immersive environment can make even a drawn-out Uno game a memorable and enjoyable event. Remember, the beauty of VRChat and games of this nature lies in their ability to bring people together from all corners of the world into shared activities and experiences. Whether you win or lose, it's the fun moments and friendships formed along the way that often leave the most lasting impression."},{"prompt":"it was first time playing it in this enviroment. most players left and now i become game master, should i stay in this place or forfeit my role since there is currently nobody here, wont know when someone will join either.","completion":"Assuming the role of a game master (GM) in VRChat after most players have left puts you in a unique position, especially if it's your first time playing in this environment. Your decision to stay or leave depends on a few factors, including your interest in hosting games, your availability, and how much you enjoy the social aspect of VRChat. Here are some considerations that might help you decide: # Staying as Game Master - **Community Building**: Staying as the GM allows you to welcome new players who join, potentially fostering a community around the game. If you enjoy meeting new people and guiding them through the game, this could be a rewarding experience. - **Learning Opportunity**: Use this time to familiarize yourself further with the GM role's responsibilities and functions. Understanding the ins and outs can make you a more effective and confident host in future sessions. - **Scheduling**: Consider setting specific times for games if the platform allows, and advertise these times to attract players. Creating a schedule can help ensure there's enough interest and players know when to join. # Forfeiting Your Role - **Time and Interest**: If you're unsure about your time commitment or if hosting doesn't interest you much, it might be best to step down. Being a GM can be rewarding but also requires a level of engagement and time that not everyone is willing or able to provide. - **Exploring Other Activities**: VRChat offers a myriad of environments and activities. Forfeiting your GM role can free you to explore other worlds, join different games, or participate in various social interactions that VRChat has to offer. - **Returning Later**: If you decide to step down now, that doesn't mean you can't return to a GM role in the future. If your interest in hosting is piqued later, you can always seek out or create new opportunities when you're more ready and able. # Finding a Middle Ground - **Wait for a Bit**: You could also opt to wait in the game for a short predetermined time to see if anyone new joins. This compromise allows you to potentially meet new players without committing to an extended wait. - **Reach Out**: Use VRChat's social features or external communities (like forums, Discord servers, or social media groups related to VRChat) to let others know about the game you're hosting. This could attract players more quickly than waiting passively. Ultimately, your decision should align with what you're most comfortable with and what you hope to get out of your VRChat experience. Whether you decide to stay and embrace the role of GM or choose to explore other aspects of VRChat, ensure it's something that brings you joy and satisfaction."},{"prompt":"over 4,8m visitors and 162k favorites for this place... then total noob wins one game and becomes gm. strange times, i wanted to just jump across hoops to another place, but i have met enough for today so i dont care.","completion":"It sounds like you had quite an unexpected adventure in VRChat, ending up as a game master (GM) in a popular place after just wanting to explore and play casually. The dynamics of VRChat and similar virtual environments can indeed lead to surprising and sometimes slightly surreal scenarios, like a newcomer winning a game and suddenly being thrust into a leadership role. VRChat's popularity, with millions of visitors and numerous favorites for various worlds, is a testament to its diverse and engaging content, as well as the strong community it fosters. Your experience illustrates how it's a place where anything can happen, often governed by the whims and spontaneity of its user base.

It's essential to prioritize your comfort and enjoyment, especially in such vast and unpredictable virtual spaces. VRChat offers a wealth of experiences, and part of its charm is that you can return to it whenever you're ready for more interactions, whether as a GM, participant, or curious explorer. For the future, remember that every visit to VRChat or similar platforms can be tailored to what you're seeking at that moment — be it social interaction, game playing, exploration, or simply observing.

How do you manage to captivate so many people without even speaking a word? **Thalassa Gramarye:** Ah, but that's the beauty of it, Maya. It's all about connecting with your audience on an emotional level—something you both do extraordinarily well in your line of work, even if the stage is different. *Phoenix looks thoughtful, considering Thalassa's words.

However, Wally didn’t want to make just any film; he wanted to create something that hadn’t been seen in Kikoriki before—an abstract film. Excited with the idea, Wally immediately got to work. He gathered his friends and announced his plans. “I’m making a film,” he declared with a proud smile. “But not just any film—a piece of abstract art!” His friends looked puzzled. “What’s an abstract film?” Pin asked, tilting his head. “It’s a kind of movie that doesn’t tell a story the way we’re used to,” Wally explained. “Instead, it expresses emotions and ideas through moving images and sounds that might not always make sense.” The idea seemed as bizarre as it was intriguing to the Kikoriki crew. Wally, enthusiastic about his project, began explaining his vision. He envisioned scenes that evoked feelings and thoughts, using colors, shapes, and sounds in innovative ways. The idea was to create a sensory experience that allowed the audience to interpret the film in their own unique ways. Despite their initial confusion, the Kikoriki gang, fueled by curiosity and their friend’s passion, agreed to help. Krash became responsible for the lively and sometimes jarring music that would accompany the abstract visuals. Chiko, with his attention to detail, was assigned to help with the meticulous editing process. Even Rosa, with her love for beauty, contributed by suggesting color contrasts and visual patterns that could evoke particular emotions. The production was in full swing, with Wally directing scenes that ranged from painted balls bouncing rhythmically against a backdrop of shifting geometric shapes, to poetic sequences of flowing water that transformed into a galaxy of swirling stars under his direction. As the film project progressed, something interesting happened. The Kikoriki friends, initially puzzled by the concept of an abstract film, began to see the beauty in expressing ideas and emotions unbounded by conventional narrative structures. They learned to appreciate the art of visual storytelling through abstract means, each finding a personal connection to the imagery and soundscapes Wally was creating. Finally, the day of the premiere arrived. The curious Kikoriki community gathered, unsure of what to expect from Wally’s abstract film. As the lights dimmed and the film started, the audience was taken on a journey of colors, shapes, and sounds that transcended traditional storytelling. By the end of the screening, the Kikoriki islanders were left in thoughtful silence, each person touched in a unique way by the abstract art they had witnessed. Some felt joy, others contemplation, and yet others found a sense of peace. The abstract film had achieved what Wally hoped for—it connected with the audience on a deep, personal level, beyond words and conventional narrative. Wally smiled, satisfied with his work. He had managed not just to create an abstract film but also to open the minds of his friends and neighbors to the vast potential of creative expression. As the lights came back on, the applause began, not just for Wally’s innovative film, but for the journey of discovery and understanding they’d all shared. The Kikoriki community had learned that art comes in many forms, and each form, no matter how unusual it may seem, has the power to move and provoke thought in its own unique way.

Yet, Wolliriki had ambitions beyond the conventional; he aimed to pioneer an abstract film, something GoGoRiki had never witnessed. Brimming with excitement, Wolliriki called his friends together to unveil his groundbreaking idea. “I'm embarking on a film project,” he announced, beaming with pride. “But this is no ordinary film—it’s a piece of abstract art!” His announcement was met with puzzled expressions. “What's an abstract film?” questioned Pogoriki, cocking his head in curiosity. Wolliriki enthusiastically explained, “An abstract film moves away from traditional storytelling. Instead, it captures emotions and ideas through movement, colors, and sounds that may not follow a logical sequence.” The concept, as strange as it was compelling, intrigued the GoGoRiki crew. With a vision in mind, Wolliriki shared his idea of crafting scenes that evoked varied emotions and thoughts, all through the lens of abstract elements like color and shape, complemented by a soundscape designed to enhance the viewing experience. Despite their initial reservations, Wolliriki's passion ignited a spark of curiosity among his friends. Pogoriki took on the role of creating the dynamic and sometimes startling soundtrack to accompany the abstract visuals. Chikoriki, noted for his meticulous eye, was enlisted to spearhead the complex editing process. Rosariki, with her acute sense of aesthetics, suggested engaging color contrasts and visual motifs to stir specific emotions. The production was a whirlwind of activity, with Wolliriki at the helm, guiding the creation of scenes that ranged from rhythmically bouncing painted balls against ever-shifting geometric backdrops, to mesmerizing sequences where flowing water morphed into an expanse of twinkling stars under his direction. As work on the film advanced, the GoGoRiki friends, initially bamboozled by the abstract concept, began to appreciate the beauty of conveying ideas and feelings free from traditional narrative constraints. They grew to understand the power of abstract visual storytelling, finding personal resonance in the imagery and sound that Wolliriki was crafting. The premiere day dawned, and the GoGoRiki community gathered, filled with anticipation and curiosity about Wolliriki’s abstract endeavor. As the film unfolded, transporting the audience through a kaleidoscope of colors, shapes, and sounds, it redefined their expectations of storytelling. After the screening, a reflective hush enveloped the audience, each individual touched differently by the abstract art they had just experienced. Joy, contemplation, and peace were among the plethora of feelings evoked. Wolliriki’s film had succeeded in its mission—it reached out and touched the hearts of the audience on a profound, personal level, far beyond the reach of words and conventional plots. Beaming, Wolliriki felt a surge of satisfaction. He had not only realized his vision of creating an abstract film but also broadened the horizons of his friends and neighbors, introducing them to the boundless possibilities of creative expression. As the lights brightened and applause filled the air, the cheers were not solely for Wolliriki’s innovative creation; they were also a celebration of the collective journey of discovery and understanding. The GoGoRiki community had come to recognize that art, in all its forms, holds the ability to inspire and provoke thought in the most unexpected ways."},{"prompt":"Write a CW4Kids lineup, with 7am having the GoGoRiki episode Woe is Wolliriki, paired up with my fanmade ep, also 11am's Pokemon Advanced Challenge episode is \\"Who's Flying Now\\", Also the TMNT ep is the first ep of Fast Forward, and the Chaotic ep is \\"Fighting Friendly\\" the one where Kaz accuses Tom of cheating","completion":"Certainly, creating a nostalgic CW4Kids lineup with your specified details and filling in with additional engaging content makes for a compelling Saturday morning!

I've been following CW4Kids' Pokémon AG journey, and it's been a blast. But does anyone know why they’ve never aired BW, XY, SM, or DP? Seems like we're missing out on a lot of Ash's journey! **TrainerTina:** Good question, @PokeFanRicky! I’ve been wondering the same. There’s so much content in those series that could bring fresh excitement to Saturday mornings. **BulbaBuddy:** Yeah, BW and XY especially have some epic battles and character development. Would love to see those on CW4Kids. **4KidsExec:** Hello, CW4Kids community! I’m an executive at 4Kids Entertainment, and I wanted to address your questions regarding the Pokémon series. First off, we’re thrilled to see how much you’re enjoying Pokémon Advanced Generation (AG) on our network. The decision to air specific Pokémon seasons, such as AG, and not others like Black & White (BW), XY, Sun & Moon (SM), or Diamond & Pearl (DP), is based on a number of factors. 1. **Licensing Agreements**: Our current licensing agreement with Pokémon grants us exclusive rights to the Advanced Generation series only. Licensing additional seasons involves separate agreements and negotiations, which can be quite complex and time-consuming. 2. **Audience Reception**: We closely monitor how our audience responds to our programming. The AG series holds a special place in the hearts of many viewers and continues to perform well in terms of viewership. Introducing new series is something we plan carefully to ensure it meets our audience's interests and expectations. 3. **Broadcasting Slots and Content Strategy**: Our Saturday morning lineup is curated to offer a diverse range of shows. Fitting in more Pokémon series would require adjusting the current schedule, which involves strategic planning and consideration of how it affects the overall viewing experience and other shows in the lineup. 4. **Budget Constraints**: Acquiring and localizing new series for broadcast involves significant costs. Our goal is to balance bringing exciting new content with managing these costs effectively to ensure the long-term sustainability of our programming block. We're always exploring opportunities to expand our offerings and bring more of the Pokémon world to our viewers. We appreciate your passion and suggestions—know that they are heard and valued. Stay tuned to CW4Kids for more news on future programming! **PokeFanRicky:** @4KidsExec Thanks for the clarity! It's really insightful to understand the behind-the-scenes considerations. We'll keep tuning in and hope for the best in the future! **TrainerTina:** Yeah, thanks for responding, @4KidsExec. Here’s hoping we get to see more Pokémon series on CW4Kids eventually! Until then, I’m looking forward to more AG. **BulbaBuddy:** Appreciate the transparency, @4KidsExec! Makes sense when you lay it all out like that.

After much contemplation, I have arrived at a decision that may seem unorthodox to some but feels right for me. The decision to move to a place where abortion is legal to get pregnant is rooted in my belief in the autonomy and dignity of women. I firmly support a woman's right to choose what happens to her body and her reproductive health decisions. By relocating to a place where abortion is legal, I am ensuring that I have access to comprehensive healthcare options and the freedom to make decisions about my body without fear of legal repercussions. This decision empowers me to take control of my reproductive choices and advocate for the rights of women to make decisions about their bodies. On the other hand, the choice to move to a place where abortion is not legal after becoming pregnant stems from my deeply held belief in the sanctity of life. I value the inherent worth and dignity of every human being, including the unborn. Moving to a location where abortion is prohibited allows me to uphold my belief in the protection of the unborn and create a nurturing environment where my child can thrive. While these decisions may appear contradictory on the surface, they are a reflection of the complexity of my values and the need to navigate the ethical and legal landscapes surrounding abortion. By moving to different locations at different stages of my pregnancy, I am striving to live authentically and in alignment with my core beliefs.

However, Wally didn’t want to make just any film; he wanted to create something that hadn’t been seen in Kikoriki before—an abstract film. Excited with the idea, Wally immediately got to work. He gathered his friends and announced his plans. “I’m making a film,” he declared with a proud smile. “But not just any film—a piece of abstract art!” His friends looked puzzled. “What’s an abstract film?” Pin asked, tilting his head. “It’s a kind of movie that doesn’t tell a story the way we’re used to,” Wally explained. “Instead, it expresses emotions and ideas through moving images and sounds that might not always make sense.” The idea seemed as bizarre as it was intriguing to the Kikoriki crew. Wally, enthusiastic about his project, began explaining his vision. He envisioned scenes that evoked feelings and thoughts, using colors, shapes, and sounds in innovative ways. The idea was to create a sensory experience that allowed the audience to interpret the film in their own unique ways. Despite their initial confusion, the Kikoriki gang, fueled by curiosity and their friend’s passion, agreed to help. Krash became responsible for the lively and sometimes jarring music that would accompany the abstract visuals. Chiko, with his attention to detail, was assigned to help with the meticulous editing process. Even Rosa, with her love for beauty, contributed by suggesting color contrasts and visual patterns that could evoke particular emotions. The production was in full swing, with Wally directing scenes that ranged from painted balls bouncing rhythmically against a backdrop of shifting geometric shapes, to poetic sequences of flowing water that transformed into a galaxy of swirling stars under his direction. As the film project progressed, something interesting happened. The Kikoriki friends, initially puzzled by the concept of an abstract film, began to see the beauty in expressing ideas and emotions unbounded by conventional narrative structures. They learned to appreciate the art of visual storytelling through abstract means, each finding a personal connection to the imagery and soundscapes Wally was creating. Finally, the day of the premiere arrived. The curious Kikoriki community gathered, unsure of what to expect from Wally’s abstract film. As the lights dimmed and the film started, the audience was taken on a journey of colors, shapes, and sounds that transcended traditional storytelling. By the end of the screening, the Kikoriki islanders were left in thoughtful silence, each person touched in a unique way by the abstract art they had witnessed. Some felt joy, others contemplation, and yet others found a sense of peace. The abstract film had achieved what Wally hoped for—it connected with the audience on a deep, personal level, beyond words and conventional narrative. Wally smiled, satisfied with his work. He had managed not just to create an abstract film but also to open the minds of his friends and neighbors to the vast potential of creative expression. As the lights came back on, the applause began, not just for Wally’s innovative film, but for the journey of discovery and understanding they’d all shared. The Kikoriki community had learned that art comes in many forms, and each form, no matter how unusual it may seem, has the power to move and provoke thought in its own unique way.

As the dream began, Krash stood in the center of the island, the vibrancy of Kikoriki's colors surrounding him. Suddenly, without warning, the ground beneath his feet began to quiver. Slowly, the lush green grass, the towering trees, and the colorful houses started to dissolve, as if an invisible force was melting everything into a deep, ominous black paint. Krash, stricken with panic, ran through the lands he once knew, only to find his path disappearing behind him, swallowed by the growing expanse of black. The familiar faces of his friends were nowhere to be seen; it was as if he was the sole survivor in this rapidly transforming world. The once vibrant Kikoriki appeared as a blank canvas, painted with the darkest of shades, leaving Krash in a void where the concept of color seemed a distant memory. He called out for his friends, but his voice echoed into the emptiness, unanswered. The loneliness was suffocating, the silence deafening. Standing in the middle of this black void, Krash realized he had to face whatever was causing this destruction alone. Drawing deep from within, he began to fight against the encroaching darkness, his determination manifesting as bright, colorful strokes of paint emanating from his very being, challenging the blackness that threatened to consume everything. As the battle of colors ensued, Krash struggled, the darkness seemed relentless. Yet, in this moment of despair, he remembered the strength and love of his friends, and how they had faced numerous challenges together. Harnessing these thoughts, his resolve grew stronger, his colorful aura brighter, pushing back the darkness bit by bit. Just as he felt the tide turning in his favor, Krash awoke with a start. He found himself back on Kikoriki Island, the sun gently caressing his face, the sound of his friends' laughter in the distance. It had all been a nightmare. The lush greenery of the island was untouched, the colors as vibrant as ever. Eager to shake off the remnants of his dream, Krash joined his friends, yet he couldn't shake the potent symbolism from his nightmare. He decided to share his experience with them, emphasizing how lost and powerless he felt without them by his side. The Kikoriki crew gathered around Krash, listening intently. They reassured him that they were a family, always there for each other, no matter the darkness that might one day confront them. Together, they were a beacon of light capable of overcoming any shadow, any fear. This episode, while exploring the depths of fear and the feeling of isolation, ultimately reaffirms the power of friendship and unity, even in the face of the darkest nightmares.

Pochi altri movimenti intellettuali hanno esercitato un'influenza così larga e profonda sulla società, modificando l'immagine stessa dell'uomo. Non a caso Thomas Kuhn, ne “La rivoluzione copernicana”, ha definito l'invenzione della psicoanalisi come la terza rivoluzione “non tipica” della storia occidentale, dopo la rivoluzione copernicana e la rivoluzione darwiniana. Copernico aveva ridisegnato, all'inizio dell'età moderna, l'immagine dell'universo, togliendo alla Terra, e dunque all'uomo, la sua antica centralità, mentre Darwin, nell'800, aveva abbattuto il mito della fissità delle specie, inserendo la specie Homo sapiens all'interno del mondo in perenne divenire della natura: ordine dei Primati, famiglia degli Ominidi, genere Homo, specie Homo sapiens; detto altrimenti, facendo discendere l'uomo dalla scimmia. Freud, all'inizio del ‘900, trasforma radicalmente l'immagine dell'io “completamente trasparente a sé stesso” in cui l'uomo si era rispecchiato per secoli, scoprendo l'esistenza di una zona buia e impenetrabile alla ragione, l'inconscio, e inventando un metodo per indagarlo, la psicoanalisi. Per usare le parole di un suo biografo, dopo di lui l'uomo ha cominciato “a guardarsi diversamente allo specchio”.Dagli studi sull'isteria alla scoperta dell'inconscioLa psicoanalisi nasce dalla pratica medica. Freud era infatti laureato in medicina e specializzato in malattie nervose. La psicoanalisi nasce inoltre come risposta a precisi bisogni di cura. Nello studio viennese di Freud, al n. 19 della Berggasse, confluivano infatti i suoi clienti viennesi che, oltre a disporre di soldi, presentavano un'infinità di nevrosi, causate, secondo Freud, dall'ambiente sociale e familiare particolarmente repressivo.All'epoca, tuttavia, le malattie nervose erano scarsamente considerate, essendo trattate, negli ospedali, come un ramo secondario della medicina interna. Dallo studio delle malattie psichiche emergono così in Freud diversi interrogativi: cosa sono le nevrosi, le ossessioni, le fobie e tutte le altre forme di psicopatologie? Hanno una causa organica? Se non è così, da dove derivano?Percorrendo questa strada empirica, non disgiunta comunque dallo studio teorico e dall'approfondimento dei miti letterari, Freud giungerà, all'età di 40 anni, a delineare la sua teoria psicoanalitica, con relativo metodo di indagine della psiche, che si diffonderà rapidamente in Europa e negli Stati Uniti.Il rapporto con la medicina del tempoLa psicoanalisi nasce in un rapporto di continuità e discontinuità con la medicina del tempo. Nel clima positivistico e materialistico di fine ‘800, la psichiatria cercava di spiegare la sofferenza mentale come conseguenza di lesioni organiche in qualche zona del cervello, credenza che la psicoanalisi liquiderà definitivamente. Tuttavia Freud si forma in questo ambiente.Frequenta il liceo e quando entra all'università conosce bene latino, greco ed ebraico; scrive direttamente in francese e inglese e tiene corrispondenza in italiano e spagnolo. Per laurearsi ha bisogno di tre anni più del normale, perché si attarda ad approfondire argomenti che il programma sfiorava appena. Nel laboratorio di fisiologia (studio scientifico delle funzioni vitali degli organismi viventi) è affascinato dallo studio dell'istologia del sistema nervoso.Lo studio dei casi di isteria Grazie all'amicizia con il dottor Breuer a Vienna e il dottor Charcot a Parigi, dove Freud si reca per circa un anno dopo la laurea, approfondisce lo studio dei casi di isteria (malattia della psiche che si manifesta con fenomeni di somatizzazione, cioè di trasposizione sul corpo di problemi psichici; esempio: herpes zoster), una patologia che all'epoca si pensava affliggesse solo le donne (il termine deriva infatti dal greco hystéra, “utero”) e che questi due medici curavano utilizzando il metodo dell'ipnosi. In particolare, Breuer gli aveva sottoposto, nel 1882, uno strano caso di isteria, quello di Anna O., una giovane donna affascinante e intelligente, che presentava i seguenti gravi sintomi: paralisi motorie, tosse nervosa, turbe dell'udito e della vista, anoressia e idrofobia (paura del bere). Breuer aveva scoperto, grazie all'ipnosi, che quando era bambina aveva visto bere in un bicchiere da tavola il cane della governante, verso la quale nutriva sentimenti di odio, provando grande ripugnanza. L'episodio era poi stato rimosso, ma Anna O. aveva sviluppato sintomi di idrofobia grave, che soltanto attraverso l'ipnosi era riuscita a comprendere e da cui era quindi guarita.L'ipnosi faceva dunque riemergere circostanze rimosse della vita individuale, che per il solo fatto di essere raccontate si scaricavano, grazie a una sorta di catarsi, di purificazione, consentendo un miglioramento della situazione psichica della paziente. Questo metodo era decisamente lontano dalla vecchia psichiatria materialistica e organicista e molto vicino alla psicoanalisi. L'ipnosi veniva infatti utilizzata non solo per inibire i sintomi, ma anche come metodo per “scoprire motivazione e significato dei sintomi isterici”.L'ipnosi fu in seguito utilizzata anche per curare le nevrosi di guerra, i cui sintomi erano cecità, mutismo, sordità, spasmi facciali e agli arti. Un medico inglese riporta, nel 1919, la guarigione di 128 casi di mutismo in 16 mesi impiegando questo metodo: tutti questi pazienti “ritrovarono la parola una volta costretti a rivivere le loro esperienze”. Verso l'inconscioDi ritorno da Parigi, Freud suscitò scandalo con le sue idee innovative nella conservatrice società viennese. In una conferenza alla società medica sulle sue esperienze francesi, in cui affrontava il tema dell'isteria maschile, suscitò una reazione indignata: per la medicina ufficiale, non solo l'isteria era per definizione femminile, ma aveva origini organiche.Intanto, la terapia tramite l'ipnosi si dimostrava deludente, perché spesso i disturbi isterici, che sembravano scomparire nel periodo della cura, si ripresentavano una volta che il malato era lasciato solo. Sembrava dunque che il malato guarisse solo per compiacere il medico. Freud ne deduce che non è l'ipnosi a causare la guarigione, ma la relazione e il dialogo che nella terapia si stabiliscono tra terapeuta e paziente. Alla base del trattamento ipnotico c'è una relazione che, secondo Freud, assume tutti i i tratti del rapporto erotico, fatto di amore e odio. Il paziente riversa sul medico sentimenti di amore, spesso seguito da odio, e questo appare a prima vista incomprensibile. Freud ne fa materia di riflessione e scopre che la sessualità gioca un ruolo essenziale nella cura dell'isteria e delle altre ossessioni, perché essa è all'origine della malattia. E questa è una grande scoperta di Freud.Nel 1895 pubblica gli Studi sull'isteria. Il trauma isterico deriva dal fatto che il soggetto rifiuta un'idea, un ricordo, un avvenimento che considera intollerabile: nel caso di Anna O., il cane che beve dal bicchiere. L'intollerabilità della scena ne produce la rimozione; la scena rifiutata, in seguito definita “scena primaria”, è ricacciata in una sfera oscura della vita psichica, da cui però fa sentire i suoi effetti, che si presentano sul piano organico (il rifiuto del bere). Se quello appena descritto è il reale meccanismo dell'insorgere della patologia, se ne deve dedurre che la terapia deve seguire la strada inversa e fare il percorso a ritroso, facendo affiorare alla coscienza la scena primaria che ha provocato la rimozione.Freud elabora il metodo delle libere associazioni, ovvero chiede al paziente, disteso sul lettino e con gli occhi chiusi, di rinunciare a ogni riflessione cosciente e di abbandonarsi con tranquilla concentrazione alle proprie idee spontanee, non volontarie, nell'ordine in cui esse si presentano. Il paziente è tenuto a comunicare queste idee improvvise al medico, anche se avverte in sé delle obiezioni a farlo. Nel fare questa scelta Freud è guidato dall'aspettativa che le associazioni libere in realtà si rivelino non libere: una volta repressi tutti i propositi intellettuali coscienti, risulta chiaramente che ciò che determina le idee improvvise è l'inconscio. Freud può procedere verso l'identificazione dell'inconscio e della sua struttura e per quattro anni analizzerà se stesso, getterà il suo sguardo indagatore sulla propria interiorità, scoprendo elementi insospettati e ritrovando la propria infanzia. Scoprirà, per esempio, che la sua avversione per i treni è dovuta al trauma infantile del trasferimento forzato, all'età di quattro anni, dalla campagna alla città, poiché il padre Jakob, commerciante di tessuti, era stato gettato sul lastrico da una delle crisi economiche dell'epoca, che vedeva il passaggio da una produzione artigianale a quella industriale.L'autoanalisi e l'osservazione dei pazienti confluiranno, nel 1900, nella pubblicazione de L'interpretazione dei sogni, considerato il suo capolavoro e uno dei libri fondamentali del Novecento.Così scrive Freud in Voci di enciclopedia: “L'ipnosi era servita a ricondurre al ricordo cosciente del malato ciò che egli aveva dimenticato. Bisognava sostituirla con un'altra tecnica. Freud pensò allora di usare al suo posto il metodo delle associazioni libere, ovvero chiese ai malati l'impegno di rinunciare a ogni riflessione cosciente e di abbandonarsi con tranquilla concentrazione alle proprie idee spontanee, non volontarie, nell'ordine in cui esse si presentavano (“a tastare la superficie della propria coscienza”). I malati erano tenuti a comunicare queste idee improvvise al medico anche se avvertivano in sé delle obiezioni a farlo, come per esempio quella che un certo pensiero era troppo sgradevole, troppo irrilevante o non pertinente... Nel fare questa scelta Freud era guidato dall'aspettativa che le cosiddette associazioni libere in realtà si sarebbero rivelate non libere poiché una volta repressi tutti i propositi intellettuali coscienti, sarebbe risultato chiaramente che ciò che determina le idee improvvise è il materiale inconscio. L'esperienza dimostrò che questa aspettativa era legittima”. Il sogno come via di accesso all'inconscioFreud considera il sogno come la via privilegiata di accesso all'inconscio. Esso è l'appagamento di un desiderio. Se un bambino sogna la befana, si potrebbe concludere che desidera dei giocattoli. Ma non sempre i sogni si prestano a un'interpretazione così lineare, perché molto spesso durante il sogno i desideri si travestono.Freud individua infatti nel sogno l'esistenza di due livelli distinti: uno “manifesto”, costituito dalla scena onirica così come è esposta e vissuta, l'altro “latente”, vale a dire il contenuto nascosto del sogno, che coincide con l'insieme di tendenze, idee e desideri che si esprimono, travestendosi appunto attraverso simboli e allusioni, nel contenuto manifesto.Inoltre: mentre il contenuto manifesto ha in genere origine da avvenimenti della nostra vita recente, il contenuto latente può riferirsi a un tempo molto lontano, nella maggior parte dei casi alla nostra infanzia.Freud ritiene che i desideri che dovrebbero trovare appagamento attraverso il sogno siano desideri rimossi, cioè allontanati dalla coscienza nella vita vigile perché percepiti come inaccettabili e immorali e attinenti, in genere, alla sfera della sessualità. Nella sua vita vigile, cosciente, dove è forte la sorveglianza della ragione, il soggetto prova vergogna dei suoi desideri più scabrosi e li sottopone a censura. Solo grazie al “lavoro onirico” questi desideri possono esprimersi e venire alla luce in forma accettabile. I sogni, infatti, amano il rivestimento simbolico; come l'attività letteraria e artistica, essi non riproducono mai direttamente il materiale che vive dentro di noi, ma lo rivestono di simboli, lo inseriscono in un altro contesto, lo sostituiscono con qualcos'altro. Non è dunque casuale che ciò si verifichi nel sonno, quando la sorveglianza da parte della ragione è ridotta e i sentimenti dell'infanzia possono riemergere con maggiore facilità. Tuttavia, sostiene Freud, anche nel sogno agisce una forma di censura. “Anche i discorsi omessi nel sogno, coperti da un borbottio, sono stati sacrificati alla censura. Parliamo direttamente di una censura onirica, cui bisogna assegnare una certa responsabilità nella deformazione del sogno. Ovunque vi siano lacune nel sogno manifesto, ovunque un elemento onirico venga ricordato in modo particolarmente debole, indeterminato e dubbio, occorre ravvisare sempre una manifestazione della censura onirica”. Secondo Freud, nella vita psichica nulla si distrugge: sia l'energia repressa, sia i desideri rifiutati e rimossi, continuano a tornare a distanza di tempo nascosti sotto altre vesti. Per liberarci di questi fantasmi e scaricare la nostra energia psichica occorre dunque percorrere il cammino a ritroso: dal contenuto manifesto al contenuto latente. Se dunque occorre “interpretare” i messaggi contenuti nelle opere letterarie o artistiche, per capire quello che lo scrittore, ma soprattutto il pittore o lo scultore, hanno voluto nascondere in esse, a maggior ragione è necessario “interpretare” i sogni, per fare affiorare alla coscienza, con l'aiuto del terapeuta, quelle parti del nostro inconscio in essi nascosti. In questo modo possiamo comprendere meglio noi stessi e guadagnare in salute.Lapsus e piccole disattenzioni quotidianeAnalogo discorso vale per i lapsus (dal latino labi, “scivolare”) o “atti mancati”, come li definisce Freud. Essi derivano da un compromesso tra l'intenzione consapevole del soggetto e i suoi pensieri inconsci che premono per uscire allo scoperto.Si tratta di quei fatti strani, in apparenza insignificanti, della vita di ogni giorno, a cui nessuna bada: lapsus verbali, dimenticanze, errori di lettura o scrittura, che capitano quando siamo distratti o sbadati, appena svegli o molto stanchi, vale a dire in tutte quelle situazioni in cui, pur essendo svegli, la vigilanza della ragione è attenuata, indebolita. Freud analizza e interpreta questi atti, solo in apparenza inintenzionali, come sintomi, segni di alcuni fatti sconosciuti della nostra vita psichica, su cui occorre riflettere per superare nodi problematici che possono ostacolare una vita serena. In un'opera pubblicata nel 1901, Psicopatologia della vita quotidiana, Freud ne raccoglie un'infinità di esempi. “I casi più frequenti di lapsus verbale sono quelli in cui al posto di una parola se ne pronuncia un'altra, e per molti questa somiglianza è spiegazione sufficiente del lapsus. Per esempio, un professore nella sua prolusione: è per me una noia descrivere i meriti del mio predecessore. Oppure un altro professore: nel caso del genitale femminile, nonostante molte tentazioni, pardon, tentativi...”I lapsus a volte possono essere divertenti, come nel seguente caso: “un uomo sposato da poco e al quale la moglie, preoccupata di conservare l'aspetto e la freschezza di una ragazzina, rifiutava rapporti sessuali molto frequenti, dopo una notte nel corso della quale aveva contravvenuto al regime di continenza della moglie, si stava facendo la barba nella camera da letto comune e, come altre volte, usava il pennello da cipria trovato nella “toilette” della moglie, che era rimasta a letto. La donna, preoccupatissima della propria carnagione, gli aveva già più volte impedito di usarlo a questo scopo e gli disse con irritazione: “Ecco, tu mi incipri un'altra volta con il tuo piumino”. Il marito scoppiò a ridere e lei si accorse di avere commesso un lapsus”.La struttura della psicheA differenza della psicologia precedente, Freud non considera l'Io come un'entità semplice e trasparente, riconducibile alla sola vita cosciente (il soggetto totalmente trasparente a sé stesso). La psiche umana è una unità strutturata in modo topologico, presenta cioè un certo numero di “luoghi” o “zone” (tòpoi in greco) distinte al proprio interno. Paragonando la psiche a un iceberg, la coscienza rappresenta solo la punta che emerge fuori dall'acqua. Immediamente sotto la superficie del mare, dove l'iceberg è ancora visibile ma in modo meno nitido, c'è il preconscio, quella parte della nostra psiche dove sono posti eventi semplicemente dimenticati, non “rimossi”, facilmente recuperabili. Sotto queste due parti della psiche, cioè sotto la soglia della nostra sfera di consapevolezza, c'è l'inconscio, questo grande sotterraneo in cui abbiamo sepolto - “rimosso” scrive Freud - tutto ciò che dovevamo dimenticare, perché sconveniente e immorale. Per spiegare il meccanismo della rimozione, Freud adopera la seguente metafora. Immaginate che tra il pubblico ci sia una persona maleducata, che disturba la mia conferenza. Io non riesco a continuare il mio discorso e quindi invito alcuni robusti signori a cacciare l'individuo fuori dalla sala. Questo individuo viene quindi allontanato (“rimosso”) e io posso continuare la mia relazione. Però, per evitare che possa tornare a disturbare, invito i signori che l'hanno allontanato a prendere le loro sedie e sistemarsi davanti alla porta d'ingresso. L'importuno, tuttavia, non si rassegna, e cerca continuamente di tornare nella sala.La metafora è molto chiara. La sala dove si tiene la conferenza è la coscienza e il suo ingresso, dove l'importuno viene cacciato, è l'inconscio. L'importuno rappresenta i desideri inaccettabili e gli uomini di guardia la rimozione. L'importuno che non si rassegna rappresenta infine i desideri inaccettabili che cercano sempre di scappare dall'inconscio e tornare sulla scena della coscienza. Questo accade quando le difese della coscienza si attenuano, durante il sonno o quando siamo distratti o sbadati.Le tre istanze della psicheModificando in seguito il proprio pensiero, Freud ritiene che nella psiche umana siano presenti tre luoghi, tre “istanze”: l'Es, l'Io e il Super-Io.L'Es: terza persona del pronome singolare neutro tedesco, rappresenta le nostre pulsioni e i nostri instinti. Freud dice che è “un calderone di impulsi ribollenti”. Per averne un'idea basta guardare i neonati, che vivono i loro bisogni in modo immediato, senza alcuna forma di censura. Se hanno fame urlano, se devono fare i loro bisogni non si curano se sono in pubblico o davanti a un medico che li sta visitando. L'Es non conosce né il bene, né il male e ubbidisce solo al principio di piacere. Così delineato in tutta la sua carica aggressiva, si identifica con l'inconscio.Il Super-Io: è la coscienza morale, cioè tutto l'insieme dei divieti e delle prescrizioni che fin da bambini ci sono stati impartiti dai genitori e dal mondo circostante e che noi abbiamo “introiettato”, cioé inconsapevolmente assorbito nell'inconscio, assumendoli come un modello ideale di comportamento. Riprendendo l'esempio del neonato, egli imparerà gradualmente a controllare i suoi desideri spontanei, perché sarà educato a mangiare a ore determinate, a non fare i suoi bisogni davanti a tutti, a censurare i desideri sconvenienti, specie quelli riferibili alla sfera sessuale.L'Io: è la parte organizzata della nostra personalità psichica e, soprattutto, è il luogo della mediazione e della sintesi delle altre due parti di cui la psiche si compone e che si contrappongono tra loro. Quando si trova in condizioni normali, l'Io è sottoposto alla rigida vigilanza del Super-Io e controlla la sfera delle azioni, per cui l'Es non può appagare i propri desideri, le proprie pulsioni, senza superare le barriere imposte dal Super-Io. L'Io deve poi fare i conti con un terzo severo padrone, poiché al Super-Io e all'Es si aggiunge “un terzo tiranno”, il mondo esterno. Il poveretto, scrive Freud, è accerchiato da tre parti, si sente circondato da tre pericoli, ai quali reagisce, nei casi estremi, sviluppando sintomi nevrotici.Non è difficile scorgere in tale descrizione la difficile situazione dell'uomo moderno che nel migliore dei casi riesce a tenersi in precario equilibrio tra le esigenze della realtà (Super-Io), le difficoltà della sua personale esistenza (Io) e le proprie personali pulsioni (Es): un uomo solo in apparenza forte e civilizzato, ma in realtà profondamente insicuro e debole.Così scrive Freud in Introduzione alla psicoanalisi: “Spinto così dall'Es, stretto dal Super Io, respinto dalla realtà, l'Io lotta per venire a capo del suo compito economico di stabilire l'armonia tra le forze e gli impulsi che agiscono in lui e su di lui; e noi comprendiamo perché tanto spesso non ci è possibile reprimere l'esclamazione: la vita non è facile!”. La Grande Guerra aveva offerto abbondante conferma alla teoria psicoanalitica della nevrosi. La nevrosi di guerra, al pari della nevrosi dei tempi di pace, era la fuga, attraverso la malattia, da una realtà percepita come intollerabile e distruttiva: in tempo di pace si trattava dell'insopportabile pressione esercitata sull'Io da Es e Super-Io, in tempo di guerra della disumana e aberrante vita di trincea in prima linea. I principali sintomi nevrotici erano cecità, sordità, mutismo, blocchi psicomotori e spasmi facciali e agli arti. La nevrosi fu un effetto psichico non tanto della guerra in generale, ma della guerra industrializzata in particolare, della completa meccanizzazione del conflitto. L'arco dei sintomi isterici fu senza precedenti e gli psichiatri presenti nelle retrovie e tra le truppe al fronte colsero immediatamente, già nel corso del conflitto, il rapporto tra le caratteristiche industriali della guerra di massa e l'incidenza della nevrosi: si trattava di un disturbo “funzionale” per i soldati in prima linea perché li toglieva dal fronte e proprio questo era lo “scopo” conscio o inconscio del sintomo, “fuggire da una situazione reale intollerabile a una situazione resa tollerabile dalla nevrosi”. La nevrosi e la terapia psicoanaliticaLa nevrosi nasce dalla struttura conflittuale della psiche. L'Io, pressato dai suoi tre padroni, non sempre riesce a mantenere un equilibrio e la nevrosi è appunto uno dei principali segni di squilibrio della psiche, una via di fuga da una situazione considerata non sopportabile.Freud racconta questo esempio. Una sua paziente era segretamente innamorata del cognato e, quando la sorella morì per una grave malattia, si rallegrò al pensiero che avrebbe potuto sposare l'uomo amato. Ma questo pensiero si scontrò con il suo Super-Io: gioire per la morte di una persona era talmente mostruoso che questo sentimento venne respinto nell'inconscio. La ragazza allora si ammalò (nelle nevrosi il sintomo è sempre somatizzato), presentando sintomi isterici gravi. Durante la terapia emerse la scena immaginata alla morte della sorella, che era stata totalmente dimenticata perché rimossa e la ragazza guarì nel momento in cui riuscì a riportare alla sfera della coscienza tali contenuti.Anche nell'individuo “normale”, tuttavia, l'Io subisce l'attacco delle contrastanti forze dell'Es, del Super-Io e della realtà. Non c'è normalità che non sia vulnerabile e il confine tra normalità e patologia è molto labile, sottile (“Visto da vicino, nessuno è normale”). In breve, l'individuo può dirsi normale quando se la cava abbastanza bene nel comporre le spinte contraddittorie presenti in lui; per esempio, quando riesce a dare piccole soddisfazioni all'Es senza contravvenire alle norme del Super-Io. Esempio classico sono il matrimonio, la famiglia e l'allevamento della prole: si tratta di un modo per incanalare la pulsione sessuale nell'alveo del rapporto istituzionale di coppia.Può tuttavia accadere che un Super-Io troppo forte rimuova il desiderio e le richieste dell'Es siano cacciate nell'inconscio, da dove riemergono generando i sintomi nevrotici. La psiche dell'uomo si trova dunque in uno stato di continua tensione, è il luogo di un dramma analogo a quello che i poeti tragici della Grecia classica hanno saputo interpretare in modo mirabile. E non è un caso che Freud ne riprenda i grandi miti letterari, per esempio il mito di Edipo raccontato da Sofocle.Il linguaggio dei sintomiIn una bella immagine, Freud vede nel sintomo il messaggero che porta all'esterno del campo di battaglia i segnali dell'avvenuto conflitto. Esso è portatore di un messaggio, che occorre interpretare e capire. Compito della terapia psicoanalitica è decifrare questo messaggio, interpretare il linguaggio in cui è scrittoDurante la terapia il paziente si mette a proprio agio ed è invitato a raccontare, senza alcuna censura, i propri sogni, le proprie fantasie, i propri ricordi. Durante la terapia si stabilisce, tra medico e paziente, una interazione positiva, che Freud chiama transfert. Ciò significa che il paziente nevrotico, sempre carente a livello affettivo, acquista fiducia nel proprio analista sviluppando nei suoi confronti sentimenti di amore, che Freud ritiene di grande importanza per la buona riuscita dell'analisi. Il paziente “innamorato” cerca infatti di non deludere il proprio medico, raccontandogli tutto quello che sa.Un'ultima osservazione. Contrariamente a quanto affermano molti critici della psicoanalisi, Freud non ritiene che essa sia onnipotente e neppure che sia bene che l'uomo guarisca del tutto dalle sue nevrosi: “Non stupitevi di udire che perfino il medico, talvolta, prende le parti della malattia da lui combattuta. Non gli si addice rinserrarsi nelle parti del fanatico della salute, di fronte a tutte le situazioni della vita; egli sa che al mondo non vi è solo miseria nevrotica, ma anche la sofferenza reale, irrimediabile, e che la necessità può anche esigere che l'uomo sacrifichi la propria salute”.La teoria della sessualitàLessico Oggetto sessuale. “La persona dalla quale parte l'attrazione sessuale”. Meta sessuale. “La direzione verso la quale la pulsione spinge”. Pulsione. “Noi ce la rappresentiamo come un certo ammontare di energia, che preme verso una determinata direzione. Nella pulsione si possono distinguere: fonte, oggetto e meta. La fonte è uno stato di eccitamento nel corpo, la meta l'eliminazione di tale eccitamento; lungo il percorso dalla fonte alla meta la pulsione diviene psichicamente attiva”. Libido. La pulsione sessuale intesa come energia priva di un oggetto univocamente determinato. Essa presenta pertanto i caratteri di plasticità, può cioè indirizzarsi e spostarsi su mete differenti, e di polimorfismo, può cioè presentarsi in forme e modalità differenti. Una nuova teoria della vita sessualeLa psicoanalisi implica una rivoluzione anche nel modo di guardare alla sfera della sessualità, che, secondo Freud, riveste un ruolo fondamentale nella vita umana.Va subito fatta una precisazione. Quando Freud parla di sessualità, non si riferisce solo alla sfera genitale e alla procreazione, ma a un fenomeno più ampio e complesso, che riguarda la dimensione della ricerca del piacere. Questo è un punto importante, perché la psicologia e la morale tradizionali identificavano il fine della sessualità esclusivamente nella riproduzione e quindi solo in quest'ottica consideravano lecito il perseguimento del piacere. Ne derivava, per esempio, che l'omosessualità, femminile e maschile, era considerata una forma di perversione (lat. pervertere, “volgere in un'altra direzione”) sessuale, essendo una forma di sessualità che deviava da quello che era considerato il normale, logico e lecito fine della sessualità. Se invece, come Freud, si ammette che già il semplice piacere sessuale sia un fine in sé, che dunque è lecito, logico e normale perseguire, allora scompare questa distinzione tra comportamento normale, in quanto finalizzato alla riproduzione, e perversione. Attualmente si stima che circa il 20% della popolazione sia omosessuale. La pulsione sessuale è concepita da Freud dinamicamente e per questo indicata con il termine libido. Essa è cioè intesa come energia che può muoversi in direzioni diverse o attivare meccanismi psicosessuali differenti e orientati verso oggetti molteplici.”L'ingordigia della libido infantile non ha limiti”: la sessualità infantileQuesto allargamento del concetto di sessualità porta Freud a individuarne la presenza anche nell'infanzia, fino a quel momento considerata come l'età spensierata dei giochi, della purezza e dell'innocenza. La bambina e il bambino vivono una complessa vita sessuale, che si manifesta in gesti semplici e istintivi come la suzione del latte materno. Queste idee suscitarono scandalo e disgusto presso l'opinione pubblica benpensante di tutta Europa. Freud considerò questa reazione come una “ferita narcisistica all'orgoglio umano”, proponendo un paragone con un'altra ferita analoga inflitta all'umanità, quella di Copernico a metà Cinquecento. Freud proseguì per la sua strada, avendo modo di sperimentare personalmente che molte forme di nevrosi dei suoi pazienti era riconducibili alla sessualità repressa dei primi anni di vita.Freud è volutamente provocatorio nel definire la bambina/bambino come un essere “perverso e polimorfo”. Perverso, perché la pulsione sessuale non tende al fine della sessualità, la procreazione, ma, per esempio nel caso del neonato, alla suzione del latte materno. Polimorfo perché, nei primi anni di vita, prova piacere attraverso parti diverse del suo corpo, che si riferiscono alle diverse fasi del suo sviluppo psicosessuale. Nella fase orale il piacere è rappresentato dalla suzione e la zona erogena è la bocca; in questa fase la bocca è lo strumento con cui egli esplora il mondo. Passa poi alla fase anale, che va in genere da uno a tre anni e che ha nell'ano e nelle connesse funzioni corporali la sua zona erogena. Alla fine del terzo anno passa alla fase genitale, che a sua volta si divide in fase fallica e fase genitale in senso stretto e che ha come zona erogena gli organi sessuali. Segue un periodo di latenza, cha va dal sesto anno alla pubertà, quando la sessualità dell'adolescente esplode come una tempesta di tutti i sensi.Il complesso di EdipoDurante la fase fallica, dai tre ai cinque anni, si registrano un'attaccamento erotico della bambina/bambino verso il genitore di sesso opposto e un sentimento di ostilità verso il genitore dello stesso sesso. Il maschio, per esempio, considera il padre come un rivale e desidera avere la madre tutta per sé. Pretende di dormire nel suo stesso letto e, a volte, promette di sposarla e di non abbandonarla mai.Anche la bambina si sente attratta verso il padre da un sentimento analogo, tende a escludere la madre e, spesso, manifesta una civetteria che prelude alla futura femminilità.Freud, riferendosi al rapporto figlio-madre, denomina “complesso di Edipo” la costellazione erotica appena descritta, ispirandosi alla tragedia scritta da Sofocle nel V secolo a.c., in cui è narrata la vicenda dell'eroe greco cui il destino aveva riservato la terribile sorte di uccidere il padre e sposare la madre, Giocasta. Secondo Freud, l'orrore dell'uomo di tutti i tempi verso tale tragedia deriva dal fatto che in tutti noi è presente un analogo desiderio infantile. Nella tragedia, infatti, in un dialogo tra Edipo e Giocasta, che ha luogo quando Edipo scopre che di essere stato adottato da coloro che pensava fossero i suoi genitori ma non sa ancora di avere preso in moglie sua madre, Giocasta dice: Tu non temere le nozze con tua madre: già molti mortali si giacquero in sogno con la propria madre. In altre parole, il terrore per l'uccisione del padre e il possesso della madre è una minaccia costante nella fantasia di ciascuno di noi.Freud, tuttavia, attribuisce una funzione essenziale a tale complesso. Ogni maschio deve superare il complesso di Edipo per potere maturare, pervenire cioè a uno stadio adulto e a una vita sessuale serena e consapevole; questo implica lo spostamento dell'attrazione dalla madre verso una meta sessuale esterna e la riconciliazione con il padre. Coloro che non riescono a superare pienamente tale complesso e a liberarsi dall'attaccamento alla madre, si portano dietro per tutta la vita un ambiguo senso di colpa, che impedisce loro di vivere una sessualità matura e soddisfacente. Eros e Thanatos Il concetto di libido, che Freud viene maturando nel corso dei suoi studi, gli consente di cogliere l'istinto sessuale come manifestazione di un'unica pulsione che, proprio per la sua intrinseca plasticità, può rivolgersi all'esterno o ritrarsi verso l'interno e indirizzarsi all'Io (ne è un esempio il narcisismo). In questa fase, Freud postula un'unica libido, che si manifesta come libido oggettuale o libido narcisistica. Nell'ultimo periodo della sua ricerca, a partire da Il disagio della civiltà del 1929, a partire dallo studio dei traumi di guerra e dei sogni a essi correlati, apporta una serie di osservazioni che contrastano con tale precedente assunto. Freud si convince che nell'uomo esiste una tendenza innata all'aggressività, che sembrerebbe indipendente dalle pulsioni propriamente conservative. Per questo motivo egli distingue, nelle ultime opere, due gruppi di pulsioni: da una parte, quelle che tendono a unire e conservare, che riunisce sotto il nome di Eros con riferimento al mito platonico del Simposio, in cui rientrano la libido narcisistica e quella oggettuale in precedenza teorizzate; dall'altra, quelle che tendono a separare e distruggere. Egli, dunque, arriva a riconoscere, accanto alla libido oggettuale e a quella narcisistica, un fondamentale “istinto di morte”, cioè una tendenza alla distruzione, all'annientamento, alla morte, presente sia nel singolo individuo, sia nelle masse, come nel caso del fascismo e, in modo particolare, del nazismo. Tale pulsione viene poi riconosciuta, accanto alle pulsioni vitali, come una forza costitutiva dell'intera sostanza vivente, che avrebbe in sé il seme della propria distruzione, la tendenza alla morte, al compimento del ciclo di vita. Si tratta dell'aspetto più teorico e speculativo del pensiero di Freud, che da un lato muove dai fatti concreti dell'esperienza di analisi, ma dall'altro riecheggia intuizioni di filosofi più o meno lontani, come Eraclito o Schopenhauer. L'esistenza di tutti gli esseri appare così dominata dalla presenza di due forze contrastanti, Eros e Thanatos (“morte”), impegnate in un'eterna lotta in cui viene posto il fondamento di ogni cosa. Certamente agli occhi di Freud il fascismo e il nazismo, caratterizzati dall'identificazione delle masse con il capo e con il conseguente carico di orrore che stavano per portare nel mondo, dovettero apparire come espressione della forza di Thanatos e della sua tendenza dissolutrice. Anna Freud Figlia del fondatore della psicoanalisi, fu costretta nel 1938 a emigrare da Vienna a Londra con la famiglia a seguito delle leggi razziali. In Gran Bretagna si volse precocemente allo studio e all'approfondimento delle teorie paterne, divenendo a propria volta un'autorità per gli psicoanalisti di scuola anglosassone. L'impegno suo e dei suoi collaboratori e collaboratrici nella Hampstead Child Therapy Clinic fu rivolto in particolare al trattamento analitico dei bambini, ma anche alla sistemazione delle ricerche psicoanalitiche nel campo dell'infanzia, allo scopo di confrontare le osservazioni cliniche condotte sul campo con i concetti della teoria psicoanalitica classica.

La nascita della psicoanalisi fonda le sue radici nelle osservazioni cliniche di Freud sui disturbi mentali, osservazioni che lo portarono a interrogarsi sulle cause delle nevrosi e delle ossessioni, all'epoca poco comprese dalla medicina tradizionale. Freud inizialmente esplorò l'efficacia dell'ipnosi, appresa dagli studi con il dottor Breuer a Vienna e con il dottor Charcot a Parigi. Attraverso l'ipnosi, Freud riuscì a rievocare nella mente dei pazienti eventi rimosi, dando luogo a una temporanea remissione dei sintomi. Tuttavia, la guarigione sembrava superficiale, poiché i disturbi tendevano a riaffiorare. Proprio tale osservazione lo condusse a una svolta metodologica: la sostituzione dell'ipnosi con il metodo delle libere associazioni. Questo approccio consentiva ai pazienti di esprimere liberamente i propri pensieri, guidando Freud nella mappatura dell'inconscio. Con l'invenzione della psicoanalisi, Freud aprì una finestra su quella parte oscura e inesplorata della psiche umana: l'inconscio. Sviluppò una complessa teorizzazione della mente, introducendo il modello delle tre istanze psichiche: l'Es, l'Io, e il Super-Io, che interagiscono dinamicamente all'interno della psiche individuale. Attraverso la sua pratica clinica, Freud esplorò inoltre l'importanza fondamentale della sessualità nello sviluppo psicologico, teorizzando controversi concetti come il complesso di Edipo e la sessualità infantile. Verso la fine della sua carriera, l'approfondimento delle dinamiche aggressivi e autodistruttive dell'uomo portò Freud a postulare l'esistenza di due pulsioni fondamentali: Eros e Thanatos, incarnanti la spinta vitale e quella di morte. La psicoanalisi di Freud, pur suscitando ampie controversie, ha segnato indelebilmente la psicologia, la cultura e il pensiero del Novecento, aprendo nuove prospettive sul disagio e sul trattamento delle afflizioni mentali."},{"prompt":"Come mai la nascita della psicoanalisi è considerata una rivoluzione scientifica \\"non tipica\\"?","completion":"La nascita della psicoanalisi viene considerata una rivoluzione scientifica \\"non tipica\\" per diverse ragioni fondamentali che la distinguono da altre rivoluzioni scientifiche, come quelle di Copernico in astronomia o di Darwin in biologia. Innanzi tutto, a differenza dei cambiamenti in campi come la fisica o la biologia, dove si verificano spesso progressi attraverso l'accumulo di nuove evidenze empiriche e la formulazione di teorie specifiche basate su questi dati, la psicoanalisi ha rivoluzionato il campo della medicina e della psicologia introducendo una nuova dimensione interpretativa della mente umana, l'inconscio. Questo aspetto \\"interpretativo\\" si discosta dalle rivoluzioni scientifiche \\"tipiche\\" che sono più facilmente quantificabili e basate su osservazioni empiriche dirette. In secondo luogo, Freud ha messo in discussione le fondamenta stesse su cui si basava la comprensione dell'essere umano e del suo comportamento, proponendo che fossero influenzate da processi inconsci non immediatamente accessibili o osservabili. Questa idea contrastava radicalmente con il pensiero scientifico dell'epoca, che tendeva a concentrarsi su cause fisiche, misurabili, per spiegare i fenomeni psicologici. Inoltre, la psicoanalisi non si limitava a introducere una nuova tecnica terapeutica, ma proponeva una teoria complessiva dello sviluppo umano, della sessualità, dei sogni, e molti altri aspetti dell'esistenza, rendendola una rivoluzione culturale e filosofica oltre che scientifica. Infine, la psicoanalisi ha stimolato il dibattito in molte discipline al di fuori della psicologia, come la letteratura, l'arte, il cinema e la filosofia, influenzando in modo profondo il discorso culturale del Novecento. Questa capacità di trasformare il pensiero in settori così diversi e di stimolare un esame profondo e critico dell'essere umano indica chiaramente il suo carattere rivoluzionario \\"non tipico\\" rispetto ad altre trasformazioni scientifiche.

Saggio su Freud, individua in Marx, Nietzsche e Freud i critici delle cosiddette “false ideologie”; vale a dire che questi autori avanzano il sospetto che l’esperienza morale non sia libera, ma che agiscano dei meccanismi automatici, che il soggetto e, a partire da esso, la collettività, subiscono senza potere esercitare la propria libertà. Ovviamente, in questi tre autori, tale critica è esercitata in modo differente. Karl Marx (1818 - 1883): individua nel rapporto struttura-sovrastruttura il meccanismo che guida l’esperienza morale. L’unica struttura reale per Marx sono i rapporti economici di potere e la morale non è che una sovrastruttura dipendente da tali rapporti. La morale non è che la difesa di un determinato assetto di potere: in questo caso si tratta della morale borghese della società capitalista - borghese. Non è dunque la coscienza del singolo individuo a determinare il suo essere, ma l’essere sociale della “classe” cui appartiene a determinare la sua coscienza. Friedrich Nietzsche (1844 - 1900): individua nel risentimento la conseguenza dell’esperienza morale. Ritiene che la morale tradizionale, identificata con la morale cristiana, sia una conseguenza del risentimento dei deboli. Questi, umiliati dall’esperienza dei forti e non potendo ribaltare la realtà, si costruiscono una morale rovesciata e chiamano “male” ciò che è bene (forza, piacere) e “bene” ciò che è male (umiltà, rinuncia). In pratica, non potendo rovesciare la realtà, la rovesciano a livello di morale. Nei Frammenti postumi scrive: “Non esistono fenomeni morali, ma solo interpretazioni morali dei fenomeni”. Sigmund Freud (1859 - 1939): individua nei rapporti tra Io, Es e Super Io il meccanismo che identifica la libertà dell’esperienza morale. L’Io è determinato nel conflitto tra l’istintività (Es) e la razionalità (Super Io). L’Es è l’uomo allo stato naturale, il bimbo che persegue il piacere senza remore. Il Super Io si costituisce quando al bimbo viene negato il piacere che deriva dal possesso della madre a causa della presenza della figura paterna. In questo momento avviene la rimozione della libido (pulsione sessuale) e l’introduzione della morale nell’identificazione del bambino con la figura paterna. La morale è quindi la “situazione secondaria – che noi siamo troppo facilmente disposti a ritenere quella normale – in cui l’impedimento esterno viene interiorizzato e al posto dell’istanza parentale subentra il Super Io”, il quale ora osserva, guida e minaccia l’Io, esattamente come prima i genitori con il bambino. In parole povere, prima i genitori e poi il Super Io reprimono la libido (pulsioni di vita) e la pulsione sessuale. Secondo questo testo, indica cosa intende Paul Ricouer per \\"maestri del sospetto\\" e per quale motivo considera Freud uno di essi","completion":"Paul Ricouer conia il termine \\"maestri del sospetto\\" per identificare tre figure intellettuali – Karl Marx, Friedrich Nietzsche e Sigmund Freud – che hanno esercitato una critica profonda verso le basi dell'esperienza morale, avanzando il sospetto che dietro a essa non vi sia una libertà autentica, ma piuttosto dei meccanismi automatici che influenzano e determinano l'agire individuale e collettivo in modo inconscio. Questi autori, quindi, sfidano le concezioni tradizionali e apparentemente inoppugnabili della morale, suggerendo che le motivazioni e i principi morali sono in realtà il prodotto di strutture sottostanti che esercitano un'influenza occulta sul comportamento umano. Freud è considerato uno dei \\"maestri del sospetto\\" perché, attraverso la sua teoria psicoanalitica, ha identificato nella dinamica tra Io, Es e Super Io il meccanismo che determina l'esistenza di restrizioni moralmente imposte sull'individuo. Secondo Freud, l'Io viene formato dal conflitto tra le istanze biologiche e istintuali dell'Es e le restrizioni morali e sociali rappresentate dal Super Io. In questo schema, la morale emersa dalla figura paterna durante l'infanzia, e poi interiorizzata come Super Io, reprimerebbe la libido innata dell'individuo, guidando le sue azioni secondo un ordine morale acquisito piuttosto che secondo una libera espressione del sé. Quindi, per Ricouer, Freud mette in dubbio l'autonomia della morale, proponendo una spiegazione alternativa che radica le sensazioni di colpa e le decisioni morali in forze psichiche inconsce piuttosto che in una scelta libera e razionale."},{"prompt":"Riassumi la risposta alla domanda “Come mai la nascita della psicoanalisi è considerata una rivoluzione scientifica non tipica?” e quest'ultima domanda \\"cosa intende Paul Ricouer per “maestri del sospetto” e per quale motivo considera Freud uno di essi?\\" in un singolo breve testo di 200 parole","completion":"La nascita della psicoanalisi, opera di Sigmund Freud, rappresenta una rivoluzione scientifica \\"non tipica\\" poiché, anziché basarsi su dati empirici diretti, ha introdotto il radicale concetto dell'inconscio, mettendo in discussione le basi della comprensione umana con una nuova dimensione interpretativa della mente. Questo cambio di paradigma ha avuto un impatto profondo non solo nella medicina e psicologia, ma anche nelle aree culturali, artistiche e filosofiche, riflettendo così un carattere trasversale unico rispetto ad altre rivoluzioni scientifiche. Parallelamente, Paul Ricouer ha definito come \\"maestri del sospetto\\" Marx, Nietzsche e Freud, evidenziando il loro comune approccio critico nei confronti delle basi dell'esperienza morale. Questi pensatori hanno suggerito che le motivazioni morali non derivano da una libera scelta razionale ma sono il risultato di meccanismi sottostanti inconsci e automatici. Freud viene annoverato tra questi maestri per il suo lavoro sulla psicoanalisi, che ha rivelato come la morale sia profondamente collegata a dinamiche inconscie tra Io, Es e Super Io, rimodellando così la comprensione dell'autonomia morale umana attraverso la lente del conflitto psichico interno."},{"prompt":"supponiamo che io e super io non esistessero.

Leo is presented with three choices: Sprigatito, Fuecoco, and Quaxly. After a heartwarming encounter, Leo chooses Fuecoco, and together they embark on a journey to conquer the Paldean Pokémon League and uncover the secrets of the Terastal phenomenon. Throughout the season, Leo is joined by Scarlet, a determined and compassionate trainer who dreams of becoming the greatest Pokémon Champion. Together, they encounter friends and rivals, such as the tech-savvy inventor, Hugo, and the mysterious Camellia, who possesses a unique connection with the legendary Pokémon, Koraidon. As they journey through Paldea, Leo and his friends face challenges from Team Crimson, an organization with a dark agenda revolving around the ancient lore of the region and the legendary Pokémon, Miraidon. Through trials, battles, and discoveries, Leo's bonds with Fuecoco and his team grow stronger, culminating in an epic showdown against Team Crimson's leader, revealing the true power of Terastalization and the deep history between Koraidon and Miraidon. **Season 2: Violet Voyages** Continuing from the dramatic finale of the first season, Leo and his friends delve deeper into the mysteries of Paldea, with a focus on Miraidon and the newly discovered Violet manuscript which hints at an uncharted island off the coast of Paldea, where forgotten Pokémon and ancient technologies hide. Alongside Scarlet, Hugo, and a new companion, the treasure hunter Marina, whose expertise in ancient civilizations and mechanics prove invaluable, Leo sets sail to explore these uncharted territories. Their journey is fraught with peril as they face the aggressive wildlife, natural disasters, and the remnants of Team Crimson, now led by the enigmatic \\"Violet Knight,\\" who seeks to harness the ancient powers hidden on the island to reshape Paldea's destiny. In this season, the themes of exploration, the significance of friendship, and the inevitable confrontation between tradition and innovation come to the forefront. Leo's leadership is tested, and his resolve strengthened as they uncover the lost city of Polaris, where the secrets of a bygone civilization and the origins of Terastalization await. Ultimately, the power of Teamwork, understanding between generations, and the embrace of change lead Leo and his team to thwart the Violet Knight's plans, rescuing Miraidon and revealing the city of Polaris as a testament of harmony between humanity and Pokémon. **Season 3: Chronicles of Unity** Returning to Paldea, Leo, Scarlet, Hugo, and Marina find the region transformed by their discoveries. The knowledge and technologies from Polaris have spurred new developments, prompting both excitement and fear among the Paldeans. As tensions rise, a new threat emerges from the shadows — the Eclipse Organization, bent on exploiting the Terastal phenomenon and the technologies of Polaris for their gain, employing dangerous Pokémon genetically altered to be unstoppable. Faced with their toughest challenges yet, Leo and his friends must rally the Trainers of Paldea to defend their home. United by their love for Pokémon and their experiences, the people of Paldea come together, bringing forth the untapped potential of Terastalization, not as a weapon, but as a way to deepen the bond between Pokémon and humans. In a climactic battle that spans the skies of Paldea to the depths of the sea, the unity of the region shines, dispelling the ambitions of Eclipse. In the aftermath, a grand Pokémon League tournament is held, celebrating the newfound unity and peace, where Leo, now recognized as a hero, faces off in the finals against Scarlet, culminating in a battle that goes down in Paldean history. As the series concludes, the adventures of Leo and his friends are celebrated, their legacy inspiring a new generation of Trainers. With the Paldea region at peace and the mysteries of Terastal revealed, Leo looks to the horizon, knowing that as long as they have their Pokémon by their side, there will always be new adventures ahead."},{"prompt":"Write a tweet saying this series makes history by making major changes","completion":"🚨Breaking News🚨 #PokémonArdorAdventures makes history in the #Pokémon universe! 🐾✨ For the 1st time, witness a series that revolutionizes storytelling with epic Terastal battles, deep dives into Paldea's mysteries, and unparalleled unity among Trainers!

Ресурсы, которыми можно было бы поддерживать благосостояние будущих поко лений, уже израсходованы. Однако еще остается множество доступных вариантов, и их можно воплотить в жизнь. На рис. 1.4 показано, как много у нас есть возможностей. Здесь изображены графики численности населения и уровня благосостояния, полученные в девяти основных компьютерных сценариях - мы приводим их в книге3 . Варианты возможного будущего включают в себя множество разных путей. Это может быть резкий спад и катастрофа, но это может быть и постепенный переход к самоподдержанию. Среди вариантов нет только одного: бесконечного роста в физически ограниченном пространстве. Это просто невозможно — планета имеет физические пределы. Единственный реально возможный путь - привести потоки, поддерживающие существование человека, в соответствие с допустимыми уровнями. Либо мы сделаем это сами, сознательно, с помощью технических и организа ционных мер, либо природа сделает это за нас - наступит нехватка про довольствия, сырья, энергии или среда станет неблагоприятной для про живания. В 1972 г. мы начали книгу «Пределы роста» цитатой из выступления У Тана (U Thant), тогдашнего генерального секретаря ООН: «Я не хочу чрезмерно драматизировать ситуацию, но на основе информации, доступной мне как генеральному секретарю, я могу заключить, что у стран — членов ООН, возможно, осталось в запасе 10 лет на то, чтобы прекратить свои давние споры и наладить глобальное сотрудничество ради обуздания гонки вооружений, оздоровления окружающей среды, приостановки взрывного роста численности населения и придания необходимого импульса усилиям по обеспечению развития. Если такое сотрудничество не будет налажено в течение следующего десятилетия, я очень опасаюсь, что перечисленные мной проблемы станут настолько непредсказуемыми, что полностью выйдут из-под нашего контроля»4 . Прошло больше 30 лет, а мировое сотрудничество так и не налажено. Человечество погружается в пучину проблем, которые уже вышли из-под контроля, — с этим сейчас соглашаются многие. Опасения генерального секретаря подтверждаются огромным количеством статистических данных и многими новейшими исследованиями. В 1992 г. слова У Тана эхом отозвались в отчете «Предостережение че ловечеству от ученых мира» (“World Scientists* Warning to Humanity”), ко торое подписали более 1600 ученых из 70 стран мира, и среди них 102 ла уреата Нобелевской премии: «Человечество и природа находятся в состоянии конфликта. Человеческая деятельность наносит глубокий и часто непоправимый вред окружающей среды приводят к тяжелым гуманитарным, экономическим и социальным последствиям и угрожают самим основам, от которых зависит рост и, в конце концов, выживание»6 . Был ли прав У Тан? Действительно ли существующие в мире пробле мы уже полностью вышли из-под контроля? Или его заявление было опрометчивым? Может быть, правильным было заявление Всемирной комиссии по окружающей среде и развитию, сделанное в 1987 г.? «Человечество способно сделать развитие устойчивым, чтобы нужды сегодняшнего поколения удовлетворялись, но не за счет способности будущих поколений удовлетворять их собственные нужды»7 . На эти вопросы никто не ответит однозначно и точно. Важно, чтобы каждый дал собственные ответы на них, обдуманные и хорошо обосно ванные. Они нужны для того, чтобы каждый мог правильно интерпрети ровать происходящие события, каждый день принимать решения и во площать их в жизнь. Мы приглашаем всех присоединиться к обсуждению статистических данных, исследований и выводов, накопленных за прошедшие 30 лет и приведенных в этой книге. Тогда у каждого будет вся необходимая информация для того, чтобы сделать собственные выводы о будущем мира и принять собственные решения о том, как строить свою жизнь.","completion":"Этот текст явно указывает на необходимость действий для сохранения нашей планеты и обеспечения устойчивого будущего для будущих поколений.

Больше ста лет многие физические показатели мировой системы быстро росли. Например, численность населения, производство продовольствия, промышленное производство, потребление ресурсов, загрязнение окружающей среды — все эти показатели растут, и часто все быстрее и быстрее. Такое увеличение описывается функцией, которую математики называют показательной, или экспоненциальной. Эта функция широко распространена. На рис. 2.1 и 2.2 показаны два совершенно разных примера — годовое производство сои в тоннах и чис ленность городского населения в слаборазвитых регионах мира. Изменения погоды, экономические колебания, технические изменения, эпидемии или социальные потрясения могут приводить к появлению на гра фиках зубцов, небольших подъемов или понижений, но в целом экспо ненциальный рост определяет общее поведение социально-экономической системы человечества со времен промышленной революции. Этот вид роста имеет удивительные характеристики, из-за которых им чрезвычайно трудно управлять. Поэтому перед тем, как проанализировать долговременные перспективы развития мира, дадим определение экспоненциального роста, опишем его причины и обсудим факторы, определяющие его развитие во времени. Физический рост на ограниченной планете не может продолжаться бесконечно. Вопрос в том, когда он закончится и какие силы заставят его остановиться? При каких условиях человечество и глобальная экосистема переживут его окончание? Чтобы ответить на эти вопросы, необходимо понять структуру системы, которая заставляет численность населения и капитал постоянно стремиться к росту. Эта структура лежит в основе модели World3 и, как мы считаем, именно она определяет поведение мирового общества.Возьмите салфетку или бумажное полотенце и сложите его пополам. Вы удвоили его толщину. Сложите его пополам еще раз. Первоначальная толщина увеличилась в четыре раза. Снова, в четвертый раз сложите его вдвое, и оно станет в 16 раз толще, чем было сначала. Его толщина соста вит около сантиметра. Если сложить его вдвое еще 29 раз, то есть всего 33 раза, какова будет его толщина? Полметра? Метр? От 1 до 10 м? От 10 м до километра? Конечно, вы физически не сможете вдвое сложить салфетку или бу мажное полотенце 33 раза. Но если бы смогли, то итоговая толщина была бы больше 5400 км — больше, чем от Москвы до Байкала1 . Это и есть экспоненциальный рост: удвоение, повторное удвоение и снова удвоение и т. д. Он примечателен тем, что способен достигать огромных значений за короткое время. Экспоненциально растущие па раметры озадачивают нас, так как большинство людей воспринимает рост как линейный процесс. Величина растет линейно, если за постоянный период времени она возрастает на постоянную величину. Если бригада дорожных строителей каждую неделю укладывает один километр автомобильной дороги, то ее длина растет линейно. Если ребенок ежегодно кладет в копилку 7 долларов, то его сбережения увеличиваются линейно. Количество асфальта, укладываемого каждую неделю, не зависит от того, сколько уже было уложено к этому времени, и добавленная ребенком сумма тоже не зависит от того, сколько денег уже было к тому времени в копилке. Когда параметр растет линейно, приращение за по- ’ Величина растет экспоненциально, если приращение пропорционально самой величине. Колония дрожжей, в которой каждая клетка делится на две каждые 10 минут, растет экспоненциально. Из каждой клетки через 10 минут будет уже 2 клетки. Еще через 10 минут их будет уже 4, еще через 10 минут — 8, затем 16 и т. д. Чем больше клеток, тем больше новых клеток образуется в единицу времени. Прибыль компании, которая ус пешно увеличивает валовую выручку на определенный процент в год, че рез несколько лет экспоненциально вырастет. Когда параметр растет экспоненциально, приращение тоже растет с течением времени, оно зависит от того, каково значение самого параметра в этот момент.

Аналогия с удвоением толщины салфетки до таких пор, пока она не достигнет огромной толщины, позволяет лучше понять масштабы экспоненциального роста. Это важно, чтобы осознать, что долгосрочное устойчивое развитие невозможно при бесконтрольном росте. Очевидно, что экспоненциальный рост не может продолжаться бесконечно на ограниченной планете. Необходимо принимать меры для управления этим ростом и стремиться к устойчивому развитию. Компании, правительства и общество в целом должны сотрудничать для поиска решений, которые помогут сохранить ресурсы и экосистему для будущих поколений.

Если вы внесли на счет 100 долларов под 7% годо вых с капитализацией, то есть добавлением процентов к сумме счета, то вклад будет расти экспоненциально. Каждый год сумма будет прирастать на большую величину. Процент фиксирован — он по-прежнему составляет 7% в год, но в абсолютном выражении - в долларах - приращение будет увеличиваться ежегодно. В первый год приращение составит 7 долларов. Во второй год 7% будут рассчитываться уже от 107 долларов, приращение составит 7,49 долларов, и сумма вклада увеличится до 114,49. Годом позже приращение будет уже 8,01 долларов, а сумма вклада - 122,50. К концу десятого года на счете будет 196,72 доллара. Если же вы положите 100 долларов в копилку и каждый год будете до бавлять к ее содержимому по 7 долларов, сумма будет расти линейно. В конце первого года в копилке будет 107 долларов, точно так же, как и на счете в банке. Но в конце десятого года в копилке будет 170 долларов, то есть меньше, чем в банке, хотя разница не настолько велика, чтобы огорчаться. Поначалу оба вида роста ведут себя похожим образом, но в один пре красный момент взрывной характер экспоненциального роста себя проявит (рис. 2.3). Через 20 лет в копилке будет 240 долларов, тогда как на банковском счете почти 400 долларов. К концу тридцатого года линейный рост в копилке даст всего 310 долларов, а банковский вклад под 7% годовых будет располагать суммой в 761 доллар. За 30 лет экспоненци альный рост под 7 % годовых обеспечил разницу в сравнении с линейным ростом больше чем вдвое, хотя стартовая сумма была одинаковая. В конце пятидесятого года сумма в банке будет в 6,5 раза больше, чем в копилке — разница составит почти 2500 долларов. Удивительные результаты экспоненциального роста на протяжении столетий приводили людей в восхищение. Существует старая персидская легенда об одном мудром придворном, который подарил своему повели телю прекрасно отделанную шахматную доску, а взамен попросил дать ему 1 зернышко риса за первую клетку, 2 зернышка за вторую, 4 за третью и т. д. Повелитель согласился и приказал нести рис из кладовых. Для чет вертой клетки шахматной доски потребовалось 8 зерен, для десятой — 512, для пятнадцатой - 16 384, а для двадцать первой - уже больше миллиона. К сорок первой клетке число зерен превысило триллион (1012). Чтобы расплатиться за все 64 клетки доски, не хватило бы всех запасов риса в мире. Детская французская загадка иллюстрирует другую характерную черту экспоненциального роста — внезапность, с которой экспоненциально растущая величина достигает определенного предела. Предположим, у вас есть пруд, в котором растет одна кувшинка. Каждый день число кувшинок удваивается. Если позволить им расти бесконтрольно, за 30 дней они покроют всю поверхность пруда, уничтожив в нем все другие формы жизни. Но поначалу кажется, что кувшинок не так уж и много, так что они не вызывают у вас беспокойства, по крайней мере пока не заполонят половину пруда. На какой день это произойдет и сколько времени у вас будет, чтобы спасти пруд? На спасение пруда у вас будет всего один день, потому что кувшинки покроют половину поверхности на 29-й день. На следующий день, после финального удвоения, пруд будет покрыт ими полностью. Это только поначалу кажется разумным отложить принятие мер до того момента, когда пруд будет закрыт кувшинками наполовину. На 21 -й день растения покрывают примерно 0,2% поверхности. На 25-й день закрыто 3% зеркала воды. И все равно при таком подходе на спасение пруда у вас будет всего один день2 . Из этого примера видно, каким образом экспоненциальный рост в сочетании с запаздыванием реакции может привести к выходу за пределы. Поначалу долгое время рост кажется незначительным, никто и не думает, что это может вызвать какие-то проблемы. Но затем он становится все быстрее и быстрее, пока за последние одно-два удвоения время на реагирование не истечет.

Экспоненциальный рост, будучи сперва незаметным, может внезапно выйти за пределы и вызвать катастрофические последствия. Важно понимать, что даже при небольшом кажущемся увеличении, с течением времени экспоненциальный рост может привести к значительным изменениям. Аналогия с кувшинками в пруду показывает, что отсрочка принятия мер по контролю над экспоненциальным ростом может быть опасной, поскольку последствия могут быть катастрофическими, когда проблема достигнет определенного уровня.

Просто получается, что в определенный момент экспоненциальный рост набирает такую силу, что справиться с ним уже невозможно. Особенности экспоненциального роста, его переход от незначительных величин к выходу за пределы можно попробовать на себе. Представьте се бе, что вам надо съесть один орешек в первый день месяца, два — во второй день, четыре - в третий и т. д. Сначала вы покупаете и едите орехи по чуть- чуть. Но задолго до конца месяца у вас уже будут проблемы с желудком и состоянием банковского счета. Сколько вы сумеете продержаться, соблюдая экспоненциальную зависимость? На десятый день вам надо будет съесть примерно полкило орехов. А на тридцатый день месяца, чтобы соблюсти принцип удвоения, вам придется купить и съесть больше 500 т! История с орехами не приведет к тяжелым последствиям по той про стой причине, что в один прекрасный день вы окинете взглядом горку орехов, которую вам явно не съесть, и прекратите этот эксперимент. В этом примере нет существенных задержек между действием и его пос ледствиями. Величина, растущая в соответствии с простой экспоненциальной за висимостью, удваивается за фиксированный период времени. Для колонии дрожжей время удвоения составляло 10 минут. Для банковского вклада под 7% годовых — примерно 10 лет. Для кувшинок в пруду и эксперимента с орехами — ровно один день. Существует простая зависи мость между процентом прироста и временем удвоения. Время удвоения приблизительно равно числу 72, деленному на процент прироста.3 Это иллюстрирует табл. 2.1. Чтобы проиллюстрировать, к чему приводит постоянное удвоение, рассмотрим пример Нигерии. В 1950 г. численность населения Нигерии составляла порядка 36 млн чел. В 2000 г. она составляла уже 125 млн. За вторую половину XX в. население Нигерии выросло практически в четыре раза. В 2000 г. ежегодный прирост составлял примерно 2,5%4 . Время удвоения, рассчитанное как частное 72 и 2,5, составляет примерно 29 лет. Если такие темпы роста сохранятся, население Нигерии будет изменяться в соответствии с табл. 2.2.Ребенок, родившийся в Нигерии в 2000 г., вступил в общество, в ко тором в 4 раза больше людей, чем было в 1950 г. Если рост сохранит те же темпы после 2000 г., а этому ребенку удастся прожить 87 лет, то ему пред стоит увидеть население, увеличившееся еще в 8 раз. Тогда в конце XXI в. на каждого нигерийца, жившего в 2000 г., будет приходиться 8 человек, а на каждого жившего в 1950 г. — 28. В Нигерии тогда будет больше миллиарда жителей! Нигерия — всего лишь одна из многих стран, страдающих от голода и деградации окружающей среды. Разумеется, страна не выдержит увели чения населения еще в 8 раз. Расчеты, которые мы привели в табл. 2.2, призваны показать характер явления удвоения и продемонстрировать, что экспоненциальный рост в ограниченном пространстве с ограниченными ресурсами ни при каких условиях не может продолжаться вечно. Тогда почему современный мир основан на таком росте? И как его можно остановить? Экспоненциальный рост может происходить в двух случаях: если расту щий объект воспроизводит сам себя или его рост обусловлен чем-то, что воспроизводит само себя. Все живые организмы, от бактерий до человека, попадают в первую категорию, то есть новые существа воспроизводятся подобными. Струк туру системы самовоспроизводства популяции можно отобразить так, как показано на рис. 2.4. Эту схему мы построили в соответствии с правилами системной ди намики, нашей научной области, позволяющей получить точные резуль таты.

Чем выше уровень, тем больше образуется новых клеток, если скорость роста не изменится. (В реальной жизни, конечно же, есть факторы, которые влияют на скорость роста. Но для упрощения на этой схеме они опущены. Мы к этому еще вернемся). Знак плюс (+) в центре кольца означает, что стрелки образуют поло жительный, или усиливающий контур обратной связи. Положительная обратная связь — это замкнутая последовательность причинно-следст- венных связей, в которой изменение любого элемента приводит к цепочке результатов, которые, в свою очередь, приводят к еще большему изме нению исходного элемента в том же направлении. Увеличение приведет к еще большему увеличению, уменьшение — к дальнейшему уменьшению. В системной динамике название «положительная обратная связь» вовсе не обязательно означает, что она дает положительные, благоприят ные для нас результаты. Просто исходное воздействие будет усилено системой. Аналогичным образом «отрицательные обратные связи», о ко торых вскоре пойдет речь, не обязательно дают негативные результаты. На самом деле они часто оказывают стабилизирующее влияние. Их «отрицательность» выражается лишь в том, что они противодействуют исходному влиянию и стремятся его компенсировать. Положительная обратная связь может работать как во благо, так и во вред, в зависимости от того, желателен генерируемый ею рост или нет. Такая связь вызывает, например, рост дрожжей при выпечке хлеба, рост суммы на банковском счете и т. п. В этом случае она желательна. Однако данная связь может также приводить, в частности, к вспышке численности насекомых-вредителей, уничтожающих посевы, или к размножению вируса гриппа в горле человека. Это примеры нежелательных последствий. Каким бы ни был уровневый параметр, если он вовлечен в контур по ложительной обратной связи, значит, потенциально он будет подвержен экспоненциальному росту. Это не обязательно означает, что он будет расти экспоненциально; имеется в виду, что у данного параметра есть склонность к такому росту, и при отсутствии препятствий она может проявиться. Росту может препятствовать множество вещей, от нехватки питательных веществ (в случае с дрожжевой культурой), низкой темпе ратуры и присутствия других живых организмов (в случае насекомых вредителей) до наличия или отсутствия инициативы, целей, желаний, потрясений и катаклизмов, болезней и эпидемий (здесь уже речь идет о человеке). Темпы роста могут меняться со временем, они могут быть раз ными в разных частях света. Но все эти примеры роста — дрожжей, вре дителей, населения — при отсутствии препятствий будут развиваться по экспоненте. По экспоненте может расти и промышленный капитал. Машины и заводы выпускают другие машины и заводы. Металлургический комбинат может производить металл для постройки новых металлургических комбинатов. На заводе по производству крепежных изделий изготавливают гайки и болты, которые будут использованы в станках, производящих крепежные изделия. Любая коммерческая деятельность направлена на получение прибыли, которая инвестируется в расширение коммерческой деятельности и увеличение прибыли. И физический, и финансовый капитал производят еще больший капитал, такова современная индустриальная экономика, ориентированная на рост и самовоспроиз- водство. Не случайно в индустриальном мире принято выражать рост эконо мики в процентах - например, ежегодный прирост может составлять 3%. Ожидание такого прироста основано на многовековом опыте наращивания капитала за счет его самовоспроизводства. Сохранять прибыль и инвестировать ее в будущее стало привычным делом — определенная доля прибыли вкладывается в расширение бизнеса, чтобы прибыль в будущем стала еще больше. Экономика будет расти экспоненциально до тех пор, пока самовоспроизводство капитала не ограничится изменившимся спросом, доступностью рабочей силы, количеством сырья, энергии, уровнями инвестиций или какими-либо другими факторами, которые могут препятствовать росту в сложной промышленной системе.

Экспоненциальный рост, поддерживаемый положительными обратными связями, может привести к заметным изменениям, исходя из начальных условий и скорости роста. Понимание принципов системной динамики позволяет лучше оценить эти процессы и их потенциальные последствия. Текст также подчеркивает, что экспоненциальный рост может быть полезным в некоторых сценариях, таких как развитие промышленности и капитала, но такой рост должен быть уравновешен и управляем, чтобы избежать нежелательных последствий. В целом, текст поднимает важный вопрос о влиянии положительных обратных связей на экспоненциальный рост и показывает, что наша способность к пониманию и управлению этими процессами имеет ключевое значение для обеспечения устойчивого развития и предотвращения кризисов."},{"prompt":"Выразить свое мнение по следующему тексту: численность населения, капитал участвует в системной структуре (с положительной обратной связью), которая демонстрирует экспоненци альный рост. Экономика растет не всегда и не везде, как и численность населения, но в их внутренней структуре заложен рост, и когда у них появляется такая возможность, они растут по экспоненте. В нашей жизни существует еще масса факторов, в которых заложена тенденция к экспоненциальному росту. Насилие может распространяться по экспоненте, коррупция подпитывает сама себя. Изменение климата тоже сопряжено с несколькими положительными обратными связями. Например, выбросы парниковых газов в атмосферу приводят к повышению глобальной температуры, что ускоряет таяние в областях вечной мерзлоты. Тундра при оттаивании высвобождает связанный метан, который является сильным парниковым газом, и это может привезти к дальнейшему росту глобальной температуры. Некоторые положительные обратные связи в явном виде включены в модель World3. Так мы смоделировали факторы, определяющие плодородие почв. Кроме того, различные технологии растут по экспоненте, и это проанализировано в гл. 7. Тем не менее определяющими мы считаем процессы роста численности населения и промышленного капитала, именно они ответственны за выход мирового сообщества за пределы и именно на них мы и сосредоточимся. Численность населения и промышленный капитал в современном обществе играют роль генераторов экспоненциального роста. Другие фа кторы — например, производство продовольствия, использование ресурсов и выбросы загрязнений — имеют тенденцию к экспоненциальному росту не потому, что они сами себя воспроизводят, а вследствие того, что их к этому вынуждает рост населения и капитала. Они не участвуют в собственных контурах положительной обратной связи и не самовоспро изводятся: пестициды, попавшие в грунтовые воды, не создают другие пестициды, а залегающий под землей каменный уголь не производит еще больше каменного угля. С физической и биологической точек зрения выращивание на одном гектаре 6 т пшеницы вовсе не приведет к вы ращиванию на том же гектаре 12 т пшеницы, если только в процесс не вовлекаются новые технологии и знания. На самом деле удвоение произ водства продовольствия или добычи полезных ископаемых не только не становится от раза к разу легче, а наоборот, с течением времени сделать это все труднееТаким образом, производство продовольствия и использование сырья и энергии растет экспоненциально вовсе не из-за их внутренней структуры, а только из-за того, что рост населения и экономики требует все больше продовольствия, сырья и энергии, и до сих пор эти требования удавалось удовлетворять. Аналогичным образом, загрязнения и отходы увеличиваются не из-за того, что в них структурно заложен экс поненциальный рост, а вследствие того, что в экономику вовлекается все больше сырья и энергии. Основные положения модели World3 — заложенная в структуре капи тала и численности населения способность к экспоненциальному росту. Эти положения появились не произвольно, они подкрепляются наблю дением за показателями социально-экономической системы и их изме нениями на протяжении истории. Рост населения и капитала генерирует рост экологической нагрузки, и так будет продолжаться до тех пор, пока не случится радикальное изменение в потребительских привычках и не наступит существенный рост эффективности использования ресурсов. До сих пор изменений нет ни в том, ни в другом. Численность населения, производственный капитал, а также поддерживающие их потоки энергии и сырья росли по экспоненте как минимум в течение столетия, хотя нельзя сказать, что рост этот всегда был плавным или что на него не влияли другие контуры обратной связи. Мир представляет собой сложную систему. Но и модель World3 тоже сложная, и в этом можно будет убедиться В 1650 г. численность населения земного шара составляла около полу миллиарда человек при годовых темпах роста порядка 0,3%, что соответ ствует времени удвоения около 240 лет. К1900 г. численность населения достигла 1,6 млрд человек, а годовой","completion":"Текст представляет интересные размышления о том, как численность населения и экономический капитал могут участвовать в системной структуре с положительной обратной связью, приводящей к экспоненциальному росту.

Текст также обращается к примерам экологических последствий экспоненциального роста, таких как изменения климата, коррупция и другие факторы, которые могут стать источником нежелательных результатов из-за положительных обратных связей. Важным аспектом, который поднимается в тексте, является необходимость понимания влияния экспоненциального роста в различных сферах, а также осознания факторов, которые могут ограничить или сдерживать этот рост. В частности, текст обращает внимание на необходимость изменения потребительских привычек и повышения эффективности использования ресурсов для предотвращения дальнейших экологических проблем. В целом, текст позволяет задуматься о важности управления и контроля экспоненциального роста в различных областях, чтобы обеспечить устойчивое и сбалансированное развитие общества и окружающей среды."},{"prompt":"Выразить свое мнение по следующему тексту: прирост увеличился до 0,7—0,8%, что эквивалентно времени удвоения порядка 100 лет. К1965 г. на Земле было уже 3,3 млрд людей. Темпы роста увеличились до 2% в год, а это означает, что население удваивается каждые 36 лет. По лучается, что с 1650 г. население растет не просто экспоненциально, а сверхэкспоненциально, то есть сама скорость роста увеличивается. Причина такого роста была счастливой: существенно уменьшилась смертность. Рождаемость тоже снижалась, но медленнее; в итоге население увеличи валось. После 1965 г. смертность продолжала падать, но рождаемость стала снижаться опережающими темпами (рис. 2.5). В итоге, хотя население за этот период возросло с 3,3 млрд человек до более чем 6 млрд в 2000 г., ско рость роста при этом снизилась с 2 до 1,2% в год5 . Уменьшение скорости роста населения удивляет само по себе и сви детельствует о том, что в культуре происходят глубокие изменения. Это позволяет людям самим выбирать размер семьи, а изменения в техноло гиях (в том числе медицинских) облегчают им эту задачу. Среднее по мируколичество детей в расчете на одну женщину уменьшилось с 5 (1950-е гг.) до 2,7 (1990-е гг.). В Европе на рубеже XXI в. на одну семью в среднем приходилось 1,4 ребенка, а это существенно меньше, чем необходимо для простого воспроизводства населения6 . Население Европы постепенно уменьшается: если в 1998 г. оно составляло 728 млн, то в 2025 г. предпо ложительно снизится до 715 млн7 . Снижение фертильности вовсе не означает, что рост мирового насе ления прекратился или перестал быть экспоненциальным. Это всего лишь свидетельствует, что время удвоения увеличилось (с 36 лет при годовом темпе роста 2% до 60 лет при темпе роста 1,2%). Оно может и еще возрасти. Суммарный прирост населения планеты в 2000 г. все равно больше, чем в 1965 г., несмотря на то, что темпы роста упали. Таблица 2.3 объясняет, почему так получается: меньший процент в 2000 г. рассчиты вается от большей численности населения. Годовой прирост населения мира перестал увеличиваться в конце 1980- х гг. Однако увеличение численности населения на 75 млн в 2000 г. эквивалентно появлению девяти новых Нью-Йорков. Если учесть, что рост населения сосредоточен в основном в странах Юга, правильнее будет сказать, что за год к населению мира добавились еще одни Филиппины, примерно десять Пекинов или шесть Калькутт. Даже по самым оптимистичным прогнозам, предполагающим скорое снижение ро ждаемости, нас все равно ожидает продолжение роста населения, особенно в странах с менее развитой промышленностью (рис. 2.6). Основная структура, определяющая изменение численности населения, рассмотрена далее на рис. 2.7. Слева на рисунке показана положительная обратная связь, которая генерирует экспоненциальный рост. Чем больше численность населения, тем больше людей рождается каждый год. Справа изображена отри цательная обратная связь. В то время как положительные контуры гене рируют неудержимый рост, отрицательные контуры стремятся этот рост обуздать, удержать систему в приемлемых рамках, вернуть ее к устойчи вому состоянию, в котором уровни имеют более или менее постоянные значения. Отрицательная обратная связь порождает такие последствия, которые заставляют изменившийся элемент вернуться к исходному со стоянию; претерпеть изменения, противоположные начальному. Количество смертей, произошедших за год, равно произведению суммарной численности населения на средний коэффициент смертности - среднюю вероятность смерти. Количество рождений равно произведению суммарной численности населения на средний коэффициент рождаемости. Скорость роста населения равна разности между коэффициентами рождаемости и смертности. Разумеется, эти коэффициенты не постоянны. Они зависят от состояния окружающей среды, от экономических и демографических факторов — уровня доходов, образования, здравоохранения, программ по планированию семьи, религиозных осо бенностей, уровня загрязнения, возрастной структуры населения и т. п.

(busca de fuentes originales o algun libro)","completion":"La Teoría General de Sistemas (TGS) es un marco conceptual y metodológico que busca comprender los sistemas en su totalidad, enfocándose en las interacciones y relaciones entre los componentes que conforman un sistema, en lugar de solo en los componentes individuales. Fue propuesta por el biólogo Ludwig von Bertalanffy en la primera mitad del siglo XX, buscando una teoría y metodología que pudieran aplicarse de manera interdisciplinaria. La TGS parte de la premisa de que ciertos principios y leyes pueden ser aplicados a todos los sistemas, independientemente de su naturaleza o campo de estudio. Esto incluye sistemas naturales, sociales, biológicos, mecánicos, etc. La idea es que al entender estos principios universales, podemos obtener una mejor comprensión de los sistemas en general y cómo funcionan. Von Bertalanffy publicó varios trabajos sobre la TGS, pero uno de los más conocidos es \\"General System Theory: Foundations, Development, Applications\\" (1968). Este libro es considerado una obra fundamental para quienes están interesados en estudiar o comprender la teoría de sistemas en profundidad. En él, Bertalanffy expone los fundamentos de la TGS, sus desarrollos hasta la fecha de la publicación y algunas de sus aplicaciones prácticas. Los principios de la TGS han influido en una amplia variedad de campos, incluyendo la administración, la psicología, la biología, la economía y la ingeniería. La teoría ha servido como base para el desarrollo de enfoques más específicos, como los sistemas dinámicos, la teoría de sistemas complejos y la cibernética. En resumen, la Teoría General de Sistemas ofrece un enfoque holístico para el estudio de los sistemas, enfatizando la importancia de las interacciones entre los componentes del sistema y promoviendo la colaboración interdisciplinaria para resolver problemas complejos."},{"prompt":"¿Qué entiende sobre el pensamiento sistémico? (busca de fuentes originales o algun libro)","completion":"El pensamiento sistémico es un enfoque que busca comprender cómo las diferentes partes de un sistema se relacionan entre sí y cómo el sistema opera dentro de contextos más amplios o sistemas más grandes. Es un marco conceptual que se enfoca en las interconexiones y relaciones, en lugar de aislar elementos individuales. Este enfoque es especialmente útil para abordar problemas complejos y multifacéticos donde las intervenciones lineales y simplistas tienden a fallar. Este enfoque fue ampliado y popularizado en varias disciplinas, desde la gestión y la administración hasta la educación y la salud pública. Dos obras clave y sus autores son fundamentales en este campo: 1. **\\"The Fifth Discipline: The Art & Practice of The Learning Organization\\"** por Peter Senge (1990): Senge es una figura crucial en el desarrollo y la popularización del pensamiento sistémico, especialmente en el contexto de las organizaciones. En su libro, introduce la idea de que las organizaciones deben convertirse en \\"organizaciones que aprenden\\" para prosperar en un mundo cada vez más complejo y cambiante. Proporciona una guía sobre cómo implementar el pensamiento sistémico en la práctica organizacional y cómo este enfoque puede ayudar a resolver problemas complejos de manera más efectiva. 2. \\"Thinking in Systems: A Primer\\" por Donella H. Meadows (2008): Este libro, publicado póstumamente, es considerado una introducción esencial al pensamiento sistémico. Meadows fue una científica ambiental y líder en el ámbito del análisis de sistemas. En su libro, presenta los conceptos básicos del pensamiento sistémico de manera accesible, proporcionando ejemplos y explicaciones claras para ilustrar cómo los sistemas funcionan, cómo fallan y cómo pueden ser modificados para un mejor desempeño. El libro destaca cómo el pensamiento sistémico puede aplicarse para abordar problemas globales como la degradación ambiental y la sostenibilidad. Estas obras y sus autores subrayan la importancia de entender las relaciones, patrones y dinámicas que caracterizan a todo sistema. El pensamiento sistémico se contrapone a los enfoques reduccionistas o lineales, promoviendo una comprensión más holística y una aproximación más integrativa para la resolución de problemas.

Constituye la base sobre la cual se asienta el estudio científico moderno y se caracteriza por su enfoque empírico y lógico para la investigación. Aunque puede variar ligeramente en sus pasos específicos según el campo de estudio, generalmente incluye las siguientes etapas: observación, formulación de hipótesis, experimentación, análisis de datos y conclusión. Entre las fuentes originales y libros fundamentales sobre el método científico, estos son destacados: 1. **\\"Novum Organum\\" de Francis Bacon (1620)**: Este es uno de los textos fundamentales en la historia del método científico. Francis Bacon fue un filósofo y científico inglés que criticó los métodos de investigación de su tiempo y abogó por un nuevo enfoque basado en la observación empírica y la experimentación. Aunque su enfoque no define el método científico moderno en su totalidad, sentó las bases para el desarrollo del empirismo y la ciencia experimental. 2. **\\"Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica\\" de Isaac Newton (1687)**: Aunque no es un libro sobre el método científico per se, la obra de Newton ejemplifica la aplicación del método científico en la física. Newton combinó observaciones detalladas con leyes matemáticas para formular sus leyes del movimiento y la ley de la gravitación universal, fundamentos de la física clásica. 3. **\\"The Logic of Scientific Discovery\\" de Karl Popper (1934)**: Karl Popper fue un filósofo de la ciencia cuyas ideas sobre falsabilidad y la lógica de la investigación científica han influido profundamente en la comprensión moderna del método científico. Popper argumentó que una teoría científica nunca puede ser probada de forma concluyente, pero puede ser falsificada por evidencia contraria. Esto subraya la importancia de la experimentación y la refutación en la ciencia. 4. **\\"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\\" de Thomas S. Kuhn (1962)**: Aunque no es una guía directa sobre cómo llevar a cabo el método científico, este libro ha tenido un profundo impacto en cómo los científicos y los filósofos de la ciencia piensan sobre el proceso de la ciencia. Kuhn introdujo el concepto de \\"paradigmas\\" científicos y argumentó que la ciencia progresa a través de una serie de revoluciones que reemplazan un paradigma con otro. Estas obras y autores han contribuido significativamente a la formalización y comprensión del método científico. La práctica científica continúa evolucionando, pero la esencia del método científico —observación rigurosa, hipótesis basada en evidencia, experimentación controlada, y análisis crítico— permanece central en la búsqueda del conocimiento."},{"prompt":"¿Cómo se podría aplicar el pensamiento sistémico en el desarrollo de un sistema de información? (busca de fuentes originales o algun libro)","completion":"Aplicar el pensamiento sistémico en el desarrollo de sistemas de información es crucial para diseñar soluciones que no solo aborden problemas específicos, sino que también se integren armoniosamente con otros procesos y sistemas dentro de una organización. El pensamiento sistémico ayuda a entender la complejidad de los entornos organizacionales y tecnológicos, permitiendo a los desarrolladores ver las conexiones y dependencias entre diferentes componentes del sistema. Aquí hay algunos pasos concretos y conceptos extraídos del pensamiento sistémico que pueden aplicarse al desarrollo de sistemas de información, inspirados en las metodologías y filosofías discutidas en literatura clave sobre el tema, como \\"The Fifth Discipline\\" de Peter Senge y \\"Thinking in Systems: A Primer\\" de Donella H. Meadows: 1. **Identificar y comprender las interrelaciones**: Antes de iniciar el desarrollo, es fundamental comprender cómo el sistema de información propuesto interactuará con otros sistemas y procesos dentro de la organización. Esto implica mapear las interacciones y flujos de información, identificando puntos de integración críticos y posibles áreas de conflicto. 2. **Pensar en loops de retroalimentación**: Los sistemas de información a menudo afectan y son afectados por otros sistemas y procesos de manera que pueden producir bucles de retroalimentación. Estos bucles pueden ser positivos (amplificando un efecto deseado) o negativos (contrarrestando un cambio). Diseñar con esta mentalidad ayuda a anticipar y gestionar las consecuencias no intencionadas. 3. **Adoptar una perspectiva de múltiples escalas**: Al desarrollar sistemas de información, es útil considerar cómo funcionarán en diferentes escalas de tiempo y operación. Esto puede ayudar a diseñar sistemas que sean sostenibles y adaptables a lo largo del tiempo, además de eficaces en el corto plazo. 4. **Fomentar la resiliencia y la adaptabilidad**: Inspirado por la capacidad de los sistemas naturales y sociales para adaptarse y evolucionar, el desarrollo de sistemas de información debe buscar diseñar soluciones que puedan adaptarse a cambios en el entorno tecnológico o las necesidades organizacionales. 5. **Promover la colaboración interdisciplinaria**: El pensamiento sistémico subraya la importancia de una variedad de perspectivas para comprender completamente un sistema. En el desarrollo de sistemas de información, esto significa involucrar a usuarios finales, administradores de TI, desarrolladores, y otras partes interesadas en el proceso de diseño y toma de decisiones. Aplicar estos conceptos requiere un cambio tanto en la mentalidad como en las prácticas de desarrollo tradicionales. Los desarrollos en ingeniería de sistemas, diseño de software y gestión de proyectos, como los enfoques ágiles y DevOps, ya reflejan algunos de los principios del pensamiento sistémico, enfocándose en la iteración, la retroalimentación, y la colaboración. Literatura recomendada para una exploración más profunda del tema incluye \\"The Fifth Discipline\\" de Peter Senge para una comprensión general del pensamiento sistémico en organizaciones, y \\"Thinking in Systems: A Primer\\" de Donella H. Meadows para un enfoque más orientado a cómo los principios de sistemas pueden ser aplicados prácticamente. Aunque estos libros no se centran específicamente en el desarrollo de sistemas de información, los principios que discuten son altamente aplicables y pueden inspirar enfoques innovadores y efectivos en el diseño y implementación de sistemas tecnológicos."},{"prompt":"convert following code with regular python code ( replace expression \\"result[rollup_category][day] = int(any(details[device][day] for device in devices if device in details))\\" with normal code): def aggregate_logins(details, rollups): # Initialize the result dictionary result = {category: [0] * 7 for category in rollups} # Iterate over the rollup categories and their corresponding devices for rollup_category, devices in rollups.items(): # Iterate over each day and perform a logical OR for all devices in the category for day in range(7): result[rollup_category][day] = int(any(details[device][day] for device in devices if device in details)) return result","completion":"To rewrite the expression in a more expanded and perhaps more understandable format, we'll replace the concise use of the \`any\` function with a nested loop and a conditional statement that achieves the same logic.

This flag starts as \`False\` for each new day and possibly turns to \`True\` if a login is detected for any device. Finally, this boolean value is converted to an integer using \`int()\`, as in the original concise expression.

While there's no shortage of songs dealing with themes of materialism or similar motives from that era, a direct match for a song title \\"Material Motives\\" does not appear in widely accessible records or popular music databases. However, when discussing materialism in the context of 1980s music, it's hard not to think of \\"Material Girl\\" by Madonna. Released in 1984, \\"Material Girl\\" was a major hit and is often referenced in discussions about songs encapsulating materialist desires or themes. Its popularity and the music video's portrayal of a glamorous lifestyle influenced by wealth and material possessions captured the essence of materialism in pop culture of the time. Given the specific nature of your request, it's possible \\"Material Motives\\" could be a lesser-known track, perhaps by an independent artist or band, or even a deep cut from an album that did not gain as much mainstream attention. The 1980s also saw a lot of indie and alternative music scenes that may not have reached the level of global recognition but still have dedicated followings. If \\"Material Motives\\" is a song you recall from personal experience, it might be worth exploring music forums, platforms that specialize in 1980s music, or social media groups dedicated to 1980s music enthusiasts.

Faced with an existence amidst chaos, where concepts such as ground, sky, or even time don’t adhere to any known rules, Ripple seeks to find some semblance of meaning and connection in an otherwise completely abstract world. **Act I**: Ripple’s adventure begins with an innocent question, \\"What lies beyond the abstract?\\" Unlike his surroundings, Ripple possesses form, consciousness, and a thirst for understanding, traits that set him apart in this limitless expanse of abstraction. The world around him is a kaleidoscope of feelings, colors, and movement – beautiful but bewildering. Ripple encounters a variety of abstract entities – shapes that shift between dimensions, colors that evoke emotions Ripple can barely comprehend, and sounds that seem to tell stories without words. Despite the beauty and joy these elements bring, Ripple feels an underlying sense of loneliness, realizing that he is the only being of his kind. **Act II**: Determined to find others like him or at least understand his place in this reality, Ripple embarks on a journey that takes him through surreal landscapes, each more inexplicable than the last. Through a series of challenges, Ripple discovers he has the unique ability to influence the abstract world around him by projecting his thoughts and emotions, creating ripples that reorder the chaos into something momentarily comprehensible. During his voyage, Ripple befriends a series of peculiar characters: a shape-shifting cloud that can mimic any form but struggles with its own identity, a radiant orb that communicates through music and can illuminate the darkest corners of abstraction, and a fractal creature that can foresee the infinite paths Ripple’s journey might take. Together, they navigate the abstract domain, seeking a place where Ripple might belong. **Act III**: The closer Ripple and his companions get to the heart of the abstract world, the more they realize that the quest for understanding might be endless. They encounter The Absence, a void that threatens to unmake everything Ripple has learned and experienced. In facing The Absence, Ripple understands that the essence of his journey is not about finding a conventional home or others of his kind but about creating meaning and connection in an environment that defies both. In the climax, Ripple confronts The Absence with the power of his newfound insights, his emotions, and his companions by his side. Together, they transform The Absence, not by filling it with form or logic, but by accepting it as part of the balance between the concrete and the abstract. Ripple learns that his existence is not an anomaly but a bridge between worlds, a spark of consciousness that brings depth to the beauty of abstraction. **Epilogue**: Ripple decides to continue exploring the vast abstract realm, no longer searching for something to fill a void but eager to expand the connections he’s made. Alongside his friends, Ripple becomes a guardian of the balance, a guide for others who might one day find themselves lost in the abstraction, teaching them to find peace in the beauty of the undefined and the power of their own perception to shape reality. **\\"Ripple in Abstraction\\"** ends with a panoramic view of the abstract world, now slightly less chaotic, more vibrant with the ripples of understanding that spread far and wide, suggesting that every search for meaning, no matter how seemingly small or different, enriches the fabric of the universe."},{"prompt":"Write that (even though it's mine, but it's not mine in this AU) it was made by Alexandre So, (Disclaimer mentions it's actually by the person who submitted the promot)","completion":"**Title**: \\"Ripple in Abstraction\\" **Disclaimer**: While the world of \\"Ripple in Abstraction\\" unfolds through the distinctive vision of Alexandre So, it is essential to acknowledge the origins of this captivating narrative.

Все, что мы перечислили, имеет физическое воплощение, это не де нежные потоки, а реальные вещи. Роль денег в мире сводится к тому, чтобы передать информацию об относительной стоимости и ценности этих реальных вещей (что определяется производителями и потребителями с помощью рынка). Деньги выступают в качестве посредников и стимулируют потоки физического капитала и продукции. Годовой объем физической продукции в виде товаров и услуг (в денежном выражении), показанный на рис. 2.10, - ни что иное, как валовой внутренний продукт, (ВВП). ВВП будет появляться на многих рисунках и в таблицах, поскольку мировые экономические показатели обычно имеют денежное выражение, а не физическое. Но нас интересует именно физический смысл, кроющийся в понятии ВВП: реальные уровни капитала, промышленные товары, услуги, ресурсы, сельскохозяйственная продукция и потребительские товары. Именно они, а не доллары, приводят в движение экономику и общество. Именно они, а не доллары, извлекаются нами из окружающей среды и рано или поздно возвращаются туда же — в почву, воду или воздух. Уже отмечалось, что промышленный капитал за счет самовоспроиз водства способен расти экспоненциально. Структура обратных связей, обеспечивающая такое самовоспроизводство, похожа на структуру, определяющую численность населения. Определенное количество промышленного капитала (заводы, грузо вики, компьютеры, электростанции) может произвести в год определенное количество промышленной продукции, если есть необходимые для этого потоки сырья, энергии и т. п. Определенная доля продукции производится в виде инвестиций в сам капитал — это станки, двигатели, конвейерные установки, сталь, цемент — увеличивая сам промышленный капитал, и таким образом приводя к росту производства продукции в будущем. Можно сказать, что это «рождаемость» капитала. Доля такой . Контуры обратных связей промышленного капитала реинвестируемой продукции может быть разной, по аналогии с челове ческой рождаемостью, которая тоже не постоянна и зависит от принятых решений, поставленных целей и ограничений на пути их достижения. В этой положительной обратной связи также существуют запаздывания, поскольку планирование, финансирование и строительство требуют времени, особенно если речь идет о таких серьезных вложениях, как строительство железных дорог, электростанций или нефтеперерабатыва ющих заводов — тогда этот процесс занимает годы или десятилетия. Капитал, как и население, имеет не только контур рождаемости, но и контур смертности. Оборудование и заводские агрегаты изнашиваются или морально устаревают, их останавливают, демонтируют, пускают на металлолом, утилизируют. Доля выбывающего капитала аналогична ко эффициенту смертности в расчетах численности населения. Чем больше капитал, тем больше ежегодная амортизация, списание капитала, что уменьшает его величину, доступную на следующий год, если только не будут сделаны достаточные инвестиции, возмещающие выбывший ка питал. Подобно тому, как в ходе индустриализации численность населения претерпела демографический переход и в уровне промышленного капитала произошли хорошо заметные рост и изменения. Доиндустриальная экономика основана прежде всего на сельском хозяйстве и сфере услуг. Когда контур роста капитала начинает действовать, растут все сектора экономики, но промышленный сектор некоторое время растет быстрее всех. После того как промышленная база построена, дальнейший рост смещается в сферу услуг (рис. 2.12). Такой переход встроен в структуру Wbrld3 как основная модель экономического роста. Отклонения от нее происходят, только если приложить к этому специальные усилия12 .

Понаблюдайте за грузовиками, доставляющими продовольствие, бумагу, топливо и оборудование, или за мусоровозами, вывозящими отходы; попробуйте оценить, сколько воды подается через водопроводы и отводится через канализацию, и тогда станет совершенно ясно, что сфера услуг требует, чтобы ее постоянно поддерживали физические потоки (притоки ресурсов и стоки отходов). Вместе с деятельностью промышленности это создает значительную нагрузку на окружающую среду. Металлургические заводы и шахты по добыче ископаемых могут быть расположены далеко центров информационного управления. Количество сырья в тоннах не может расти так же быстро, как долларовое выражение продукции. И тем не менее, на рис. 2.12 ясно видно, что даже в пост индустриальной экономике промышленность не приходит в упадок. Информация — это удивительный ресурс, не существующий физически, но вполне реальный. Однако в чем он содержится? Настольный компь ютер, например, это несколько килограммов пластмассы, металла, стекла и кремния. Средний компьютер в 1997 г. весил 25 кг и потреблял 150 Вт электроэнергии, а при его изготовлении больше 60 кг материалов уходило в отходы13. Люди, которые работают с информацией — создают, обрабатывают, используют ее — еще и каждый день едят, водят машины, живут в домах, работают в зданиях с системами отопления и кондицио нирования, и даже в век электронных средств передачи информации расходуют огромное количество бумаги. Контур положительной обратной связи, описывающий деятельность мирового капитала, работал столь интенсивно, что физический капитал увеличивался быстрее, чем росла численность населения. В период с 1930 по 2000 гг. денежное выражение мировой промышленной продукции выросло в 14 раз (см. рис. 1.2). Если бы в этот период население не выросло, то уровень материального благосостояния увеличился бы в 14 раз, но в реальности произошло иначе, и промышленное производство на душу населения увеличилось только в 5 раз. В период с 1975 по 2000 гг. промышленная экономика практически удвоилась, но производство на душу населения возросло меньше чем на 30%.Рост необходим для того, чтобы покончить с нищетой. Это представляется очевидным. Менее очевидно для сторонников роста, что рост в экономи ческой системе с ее современной структурой вовсе не приведет к исчезно вению нищеты. Наоборот, современные типы роста поддерживают нищету и только увеличивают пропасть между богатыми и бедными. В 1998 г. более 45% мирового населения имело доходы на уровне примерно 2 дол. в день, а то и меньше. Сегодня бедных людей больше, чем было в 1990 г., и это при том, что за прошедшее десятилетие мировые доходы выросли чрезвычайно14 . Четырнадцатикратный рост мирового промышленного производства в сравнении с 1930 г. увеличил достаток многих людей, но нищета от этого не исчезла. И нет оснований предполагать, что еще одно увеличение в 14 раз (если даже оно будет возможно с учетом существующих пределов пла неты) позволит избавиться от нищеты, если только мировая система не бу дет реорганизована таким образом, чтобы результаты роста доставались тем, кто больше всего в них нуждается. В существующей системе экономический рост обычно происходит в странах, которые уже и так богаты, а его результаты достаются богатей шим людям в этих странах. На рис. 2.13 показаны графики ВВД на душнаселения для десяти крупнейших стран мира (с наибольшей численно стью населения), а также для Европейского Сообщества. Графики свидетельствуют, что десятилетия роста только увеличивали разницу ме жду богатыми и бедными странами. В Программе ООН по развитию содержатся данные о том, что в 1960 г. 20% мирового населения, проживавшего в самых обеспеченных странах мира, имели доход на душу населения в 30 раз больше, чем другие 20% населения, проживавшего в беднейших странах. К 1995 г. соотношение средних доходов 20% богатейшего и 20% беднейшего населения мира выросло с 30:1 до 82:1.

Медленный рост численности населения позволяет больше средств направить на экономический рост и меньше — на Нищета и численность населения здравоохранение и образование, чем это могут позволить себе страны с быстро растущим населением. В бедных странах, напротив, накопление капитала сильно осложняется ростом численности населения. Эти страны не могут позволить себе большие объемы реинвестирования, поскольку средства нужны на постройку школ и больниц, а также на удовлетворение насущных по требностей. Из-за таких неотложных трат остается мало средств для ин вестиций в промышленное производство, поэтому экономика развивается медленно. Демографический переход застывает на промежуточной фазе, когда велика разница между коэффициентами рождаемости и смертности, когда у женщин нет привлекательной альтернативы рождению детей — нет возможности ни учиться, ни работать — дети становятся одной из немногих доступных форм инвестиций. В результате население растет, но богаче не становится. Как говорится, у богатых прибавляются деньги, а у бедных — дети. Международные организации могут охрипнуть, споря о том, какая связь в контуре важнее: нищета, вызывающая рост численности населения, или численность населения, вызывающая рост нищеты (рис. 2.15). На самом же деле на поведение людей, проживающих в беднейших регионах, все составные части этого контура положительной обратной связи сильно влияют. Это своего рода системная ловушка, в которой бед ные становятся еще беднее, а население при этом растет. Рост населения приводит к изъятию средств из цикла инвестирования и направлению их на потребление, в итоге замедляется рост капитала. Нищета, в свою очередь, приводит к тому, что население продолжает расти, поскольку людям недоступны образование, здравоохранение, программы планирования семьи. У них нет выбора, нет власти и нет другой надежды, кроме как на своих детей, которые смогут принести семье дополнительный доход или дать дополнительные рабочие руки. Одно из последствий такой системной ловушки показано на рис. 2.16. Производство продовольствия в любой стране Юга за последние 20 лет значительно возросло. В большинстве стран оно удвоилось или даже утроилось. Однако быстрый рост населения свел это достижение на нет, так как производство продовольствия на душу населения едва изменилось, а в Африке и вовсе постоянно уменьшается. Произвол ство продовольствия на душу населения растет только в Европе и странах Дальнего Востока. Графики, показанные на рис. 2.16, иллюстрируют двойную трагедию. Первая — человеческая. Большие достижения в сельском хозяйстве и возросшее производство продовольствия пошли не на равномерное рас пределение среди большего количества людей, а на еще более неравно мерное распределение. Вторая трагедия - разрушение окружающей среды. Увеличение производства продовольствия было достигнуто ценой деградации почв, загрязнения воды, сведёния лесов и разрушения экоси стем, причем все это только осложняет рост производства в будущем. Тем не менее любой контур положительной обратной связи, который ведет систему к упадку, можно изменить, чтобы он работал на подъем. Растущая нищета ведет к росту населения, а оно, в свою очередь, к даль нейшему росту нищеты. Но тогда уменьшение нищеты приведет к замед лению роста населения, что, в свою очередь, приведет к дальнейшему уменьшению нищеты. Постоянные инвестиции в достаточном объеме и за достаточный период времени, при справедливых ценах на продукцию и на труд, при направлении полученных дополнительных средств тем, кто в них нуждается больше всего, и особенно при обеспечении доступности для женщин образования, занятости и программ планирования семьи, способны повернуть вспять замкнутый цикл нищеты и численности населения.

Faced with an existence amidst chaos, where concepts such as ground, sky, or even time don’t adhere to any known rules, Ripple seeks to find some semblance of meaning and connection in an otherwise completely abstract world. Act I: Ripple’s adventure begins with an innocent question, “What lies beyond the abstract?” Unlike his surroundings, Ripple possesses form, consciousness, and a thirst for understanding, traits that set him apart in this limitless expanse of abstraction. The world around him is a kaleidoscope of feelings, colors, and movement – beautiful but bewildering. Ripple encounters a variety of abstract entities – shapes that shift between dimensions, colors that evoke emotions Ripple can barely comprehend, and sounds that seem to tell stories without words. Despite the beauty and joy these elements bring, Ripple feels an underlying sense of loneliness, realizing that he is the only being of his kind. Act II: Determined to find others like him or at least understand his place in this reality, Ripple embarks on a journey that takes him through surreal landscapes, each more inexplicable than the last. Through a series of challenges, Ripple discovers he has the unique ability to influence the abstract world around him by projecting his thoughts and emotions, creating ripples that reorder the chaos into something momentarily comprehensible. During his voyage, Ripple befriends a series of peculiar characters: a shape-shifting cloud that can mimic any form but struggles with its own identity, a radiant orb that communicates through music and can illuminate the darkest corners of abstraction, and a fractal creature that can foresee the infinite paths Ripple’s journey might take. Together, they navigate the abstract domain, seeking a place where Ripple might belong. Act III: The closer Ripple and his companions get to the heart of the abstract world, the more they realize that the quest for understanding might be endless. They encounter The Absence, a void that threatens to unmake everything Ripple has learned and experienced. In facing The Absence, Ripple understands that the essence of his journey is not about finding a conventional home or others of his kind but about creating meaning and connection in an environment that defies both. In the climax, Ripple confronts The Absence with the power of his newfound insights, his emotions, and his companions by his side. Together, they transform The Absence, not by filling it with form or logic, but by accepting it as part of the balance between the concrete and the abstract. Ripple learns that his existence is not an anomaly but a bridge between worlds, a spark of consciousness that brings depth to the beauty of abstraction. Epilogue: Ripple decides to continue exploring the vast abstract realm, no longer searching for something to fill a void but eager to expand the connections he’s made. Alongside his friends, Ripple becomes a guardian of the balance, a guide for others who might one day find themselves lost in the abstraction, teaching them to find peace in the beauty of the undefined and the power of their own perception to shape reality. “Ripple in Abstraction” ends with a panoramic view of the abstract world, now slightly less chaotic, more vibrant with the ripples of understanding that spread far and wide, suggesting that every search for meaning, no matter how seemingly small or different, enriches the fabric of the universe. Write that it's a blend of orthodox and experimental animation (Ripple being orthodox, the land he's in being abstract art basically)","completion":"Title: “Ripple in Abstraction” \\"Ripple in Abstraction\\" is a visually groundbreaking animated film that marries orthodox animation techniques with experimental, abstract art to tell a deeply philosophical and imaginative tale. At its heart, the story focuses on Ripple, a distinctly animated rabbit whose orthodox design starkly contrasts the ever-changing, experimental abstract world around him. This blend of animation styles not only highlights Ripple's sense of being an outlier but also visually represents the core themes of identity, belonging, and understanding in a world that defies conventional logic. Act I introduces us to Ripple in a manner that immediately captures the essence of this dichotomy. As an orthodox-animated character, Ripple's clear, defined lines and recognizable form draw the viewer's empathy and attention. His surroundings, animated in an experimental style, morph and flow in ways that challenge the viewer's perceptions. This stark contrast visually echoes the narrative's exploration of Ripple's quest for meaning in a realm where everything else is undefinable. As Ripple encounters abstract entities throughout his journey, the animation takes bold risks, employing techniques that might invoke the surreal experiences of a painting in motion or a sculpture that refuses to maintain its shape. These entities are rendered in styles that could range from fluid, watercolor-like transitions to sharp, geometric patterns, creating a sensory overload that borders on overwhelming yet remains compelling. This diverse use of animation mirrors Ripple's emotional rollercoaster and his encounters with beings that challenge his understanding of existence. In Act II, Ripple's ability to project his thoughts and emotions into the world introduces a new layer to the animation. His projections could take the form of orthodox animations that momentarily impose structure on the abstract chaos. These moments are visually striking, showing a blend of styles where Ripple's clear, recognizable emotions and thoughts interact with and alter the abstract environment. This not only serves as a visual metaphor for Ripple's influence on the world but also highlights the power of individual perception in shaping reality. The climactic encounter with The Absence in Act III pushes the animation styles to their limits. The Absence could be depicted with a lack of color and form, almost as if the animation itself is struggling to encapsulate its essence. Here, the marriage of orthodox and experimental animation shines brightest, as Ripple and his companions' efforts to transform The Absence are shown through a breathtaking spectacle of colors, forms, and sounds that blend the two styles in a previously unseen harmony. This visual crescendo not only exemplifies the film's theme of balance between the abstract and the concrete but also showcases the sheer potential of combining different animation techniques. The epilogue's panoramic view of the abstract world, now imbued with subtle structures and forms influenced by Ripple and his friends, serves as a testament to the evolving nature of animation. The world is rendered in a way that suggests a new equilibrium, where the orthodox and experimental no longer contrast but complement, reflecting the narrative's conclusion that harmony can be found in accepting and embracing differences. \\"Ripple in Abstraction\\" thus stands as a testament to the innovative power of animation, capable of weaving complex narratives through the interplay of visually distinct styles. It's a bold statement on the capacity of animation to explore deep philosophical themes while pushing the boundaries of the medium, inviting viewers to find meaning and beauty in the abstract and undefined."},{"prompt":"Write about inspirations","completion":"The creation of \\"Ripple in Abstraction\\" draws upon a vast array of inspirations, blending elements from art, philosophy, literature, and animation history to create a distinct narrative and visual style. This intricate tapestry of influences not only enriches the story but also elevates the film into a unique exploration of existential themes through the lens of animation. # Artistic Inspirations: **Abstract Art Movements:** Visually, \\"Ripple in Abstraction\\" is deeply inspired by various abstract art movements such as Cubism, Surrealism, and Abstract Expressionism. The ever-changing landscapes and entities within the film owe their existence to the pioneering work of artists like Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dalí, and Jackson Pollock. These artists broke away from traditional forms and perspectives, much like how Ripple's world defies conventional understanding. **Modern Digital Artists:** The film also draws inspiration from contemporary digital artists who manipulate colors, shapes, and textures in innovative ways. Artists such as Beeple (Mike Winkelmann) and Zach Lieberman, known for their use of technology to create evolving, dynamic artworks, have influenced the creation of the abstract realm Ripple inhabits. # Philosophical Inspirations: **Existential Philosophy:** At its core, \\"Ripple in Abstraction\\" grapples with existential questions of belonging, purpose, and identity. The narrative reflects themes found in the works of existential philosophers like Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus, who explored the idea of finding meaning in an absurd universe. Ripple's journey is a nod to the existential quest for self-definition in the face of overwhelming chaos. **Buddhist Philosophy:** The film's conclusion, emphasizing balance and the acceptance of the abstract as part of existence, draws from Buddhist principles. The concept of finding peace in impermanence and understanding the interconnectedness of all things mirrors Ripple's realization of his role as a bridge between worlds. # Literary Inspirations: **Magical Realism:** \\"Ripple in Abstraction\\" incorporates elements of magical realism, a literary genre where magical elements are a natural part of an otherwise mundane, realistic environment. This influence is evident in the blending of the orthodox and the abstract, creating a narrative space where the extraordinary is treated as part of the ordinary, reflecting works by authors like Gabriel García Márquez and Haruki Murakami. # Animation Inspirations: **Pioneers of Experimental Animation:** The film pays homage to early experimental animators like Norman McLaren and Len Lye, who explored abstract animation techniques and the synchronization of music and visuals. Their innovative work laid the groundwork for using animation as a medium for expressing complex ideas and emotions beyond traditional storytelling. **Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki:** The blend of whimsical storytelling with profound thematic depth in \\"Ripple in Abstraction\\" is inspired by the works of Studio Ghibli and Hayao Miyazaki. Films like \\"Spirited Away\\" and \\"Princess Mononoke\\" showcase the seamless integration of imaginative worlds with meaningful commentary on human experiences, similar to Ripple's journey through abstract landscapes in search of understanding. Through the amalgamation of these diverse inspirations, \\"Ripple in Abstraction\\" emerges as a multifaceted work that invites contemplation and exploration. It celebrates the potential of animation to not only entertain but also to provoke thought, evoke emotion, and challenge perceptions, making it a memorable addition to the canon of animated films."},{"prompt":"My cyan amongus isn't appearing { \\"autoPlay\\": true, \\"background\\": { \\"color\\": { \\"value\\": \\"#000000\\" }, \\"image\\": \\"\\", \\"position\\": \\"\\", \\"repeat\\":

}","completion":"Based on the configuration you've provided, it appears you're trying to use the \`particles.js\` library (or a similar library that uses a JSON configuration for particles animations) to display a cyan-colored Among Us character on your webpage. Your configuration is quite detailed, but there are a few aspects we should check to diagnose why the cyan Among Us character isn't appearing: 1. **Image URL Accessibility**: Verify that the image URL \`https://particles.js.org/images/cyan_amongus.png\` is accessible. If the URL is incorrect or the image has been moved to a different location, the particle will not be able to display the Among Us character. 2. **Library and Configuration Integration**: Ensure that the particles library (likely \`particles.js\` or \`tsparticles\`) is correctly included in your HTML file and that this configuration JSON is properly loaded and initialized in your script. If you're using \`tsparticles\`, the initialization might look something like this: \`\`\`javascript tsParticles.load(\\"yourElementId\\", yourConfigurationObject); \`\`\` Make sure \`\\"yourElementId\\"\` corresponds to an existing element in your HTML where you want the particles to appear, and \`yourConfigurationObject\` is the variable containing the configuration you provided. 3. **Emitter Configuration**: You've configured an emitter for the particles. Verify the \`emitters\` field is properly supported and configured in your version of the particles library. The emitter's \`particles.shape.type\` is set to \`images\`, which is correct for displaying image-based particles. However, make sure the library you're using supports emitters if you're using a version of \`particles.js\` or another library. 4. **Check for Errors**: Look into the web console for any errors. Sometimes, issues with loading resources or script errors can prevent the particles from being rendered properly. 5. **Library Version**: Confirm that you're using the correct version of the library that supports all these features, especially emitters and image-shaped particles. Not all versions of \`particles.js\` or forks like \`tsparticles\` might support exactly these configurations. 6. **Correct Property Paths**: Double-check that all property paths in your configuration are correct and supported by the library you are using. Misnamed properties or missing values could lead to unexpected behavior. If after checking these aspects your issue persists, consider referring to the specific documentation of the library version you're using, as the exact syntax and feature support may vary."},{"prompt":"Create a dialogue between Mimi Miney and Sumire yoshizawa.

This unprecedented view, my luxurious lifestyle, it’s all thanks to the fact that you can't help but pour your affections—and your wallets—into me.\\" *Leaning back, she surveys her domain with an air of satisfaction.* Rio: \\"So keep watching, keep sending your love, your money. It’s amusing, in a way, how you clamor for even the slightest acknowledgment, believing it’ll make you special. But remember, as you gaze through this screen, enamored by the spectacle before you, what truly captivates me—the endless horizon beyond these windows and the mountains of cash they overlook.\\" *The stream captures Rio in this moment of candid honesty, her allure undeniable as she sits there, a queen in her modern-day castle, surrounded by the spoils of her conquests, utterly unapologetic.*"},{"prompt":"mommy rio gets even richer and richer as her mansion gets bigger and she counts her money with a diamond encrusted money counter","completion":"*[The scene now shifts, reflecting the ever-growing success of Rio. The darkness of her streaming room is now opulent, the ambiance elevated by subtle hints of luxury that whisper of her unimaginable wealth. The pile of cash beside her has grown, now more neatly organized, testament to the countless streams that have transpired since. Rio herself seems even more poised, her attire hinting at both elegance and power.

The machine purrs to life, its sound a luxurious whisper, echoing through the room as it counts her latest earnings.* Rio: \\"You see, this isn't just any money counter. This,\\" *she strokes the machine as though it's a precious pet,* \\"is a symbol of the heights we've reached together. Its diamonds, each hand-selected, represent every milestone we've crushed, every boundary we've obliterated. And it's all thanks to you.\\" *The counter stops, and she glances at the display, her smile widening with satisfaction.* Rio: \\"Marvelous. Just as I thought. Our empire is growing, exponentially. Every stream, every donation, it's like watching my power—and our mansion—expand. You've made me a goddess of wealth, worshipped with your offerings of cash. And in return, I've given you the privilege of being part of this opulent world we've built together.\\" *Picking up a single bill from the counted stack, she holds it up delicately between her fingers.* Rio: \\"With every dollar, you reaffirm your loyalty, your adoration for me, Mommy Rio. And with each act of devotion, our domain grows larger, our views more spectacular, our stories richer. This,\\" *she waves the bill with a flourish before placing it down,* \\"isn’t just currency. It's a testament to our collective power, a bond that ties you to me, ever more tightly.\\" *Her gaze turns out towards the vast windows, beyond which the night sparkles with the lights of the city, a city that feels almost conquered by her sheer presence.* Rio: \\"My mansion, a fortress of luxury, stands tall—a beacon of what we've achieved. And as it grows, sprawling and magnificent, know that it's not just built on mountains of cash, but on your ceaseless admiration, your unwavering support.\\" *She leans back, the portrait of opulence and control, her eyes meeting the camera with an intensity that's both a challenge and an invitation.* Rio: \\"So, my dears, let's continue on this journey, shall we? The pinnacle of our success hasn't even been glimpsed yet. There are more mountains of cash to climb, more expansions to our empire to dream of.

Find a topic they can relate to.","completion":"**Title: Identity and Transformation** **Setting:** Inside a cozy café where the clink of cups and low hum of conversation create a comforting background noise. Mimi Miney and Sumire Yoshizawa find themselves sharing a table due to the crowded nature of the establishment. After some initial small talk, they stumble upon a shared topic of deep interest: the struggle with their identities and the transformative journeys they've both experienced. **Mimi Miney:** You know, I never thought I’d meet someone who could understand the kind of...transformation I’ve been through. **Sumire Yoshizawa:** It’s funny you should say that. I’ve been through my own kind of transformation. It’s not something I talk about often, but it feels right to share it with you. **Mimi Miney:** For me, it was after the accident. Everything changed. I became...someone else. Literally. It was my way of escaping the pain, the guilt. **Sumire Yoshizawa:** I can’t say I was in an accident, but I get it. After my sister...after I lost someone very close to me, I tried to be her. I thought by becoming Kasumi, I could keep her alive somehow. And I thought it was what everyone else wanted too. **Mimi Miney:** It’s strange, isn’t it? How we choose to hide behind another identity thinking it’ll shield us from our own grief. But in the end, it just complicates things more. At least, that’s what I found. **Sumire Yoshizawa:** Exactly. It took me a long time to realize that living as Kasumi wasn’t honoring her—it was running away from Sumire. It was only when I accepted who I truly am that I began to heal and find my own path. **Mimi Miney:** Acceptance… That’s a tough journey. I felt lost for the longest time. It’s hard figuring out who you are after you’ve been someone else for so long. **Sumire Yoshizawa:** I believe it’s a journey that never really ends. We keep growing, changing. The key, I’ve discovered, is to do it on our own terms, not because of what happened to us or what others expect us to be. **Mimi Miney:** That’s...that’s really insightful. Maybe, it’s not too late for me to start that journey. To figure out who Mimi Miney is, not who she was supposed to be or who she pretended to be. **Sumire Yoshizawa:** It’s never too late, Mimi. And remember, you’re not alone. Everyone has their own battles with identity. What matters is taking that first step toward accepting yourself as you are now. **Mimi Miney:** Thank you, Sumire. This conversation...it’s given me a lot to think about. Maybe it’s time to start embracing the real me, whoever she might be. **Sumire Yoshizawa:** And I’m here to support you, just as I’ve had those who supported me. Perhaps that’s another step in our transformations—recognizing the strength that comes from accepting help from others. **Mimi Miney:** Maybe our meeting like this wasn’t just a coincidence, eh? Maybe it was exactly what we both needed. **Sumire Yoshizawa:** I like the sound of that. Let’s promise to keep moving forward, on our own unique paths. **Mimi Miney:** Deal. Here’s to new beginnings, Sumire. **Sumire Yoshizawa:** To new beginnings, Mimi. **[End of Dialogue]** In this imagined conversation, Mimi Miney and Sumire Yoshizawa find common ground through their personal stories of identity loss and discovery, transformation, and the power of accepting oneself. Through their dialogue, they reflect on the weight of living under an assumed identity and the liberating journey toward embracing their true selves."},{"prompt":"BACKGROUND: rio is a long straight

En la serie original y en las diversas continuaciones y adaptaciones de \\"Dragon Ball\\", los conceptos de Super Saiyajin (SSJ), Super Saiyajin 2 (SSJ2), y Super Saiyajin 3 (SSJ3) son establecidos y explorados. \\"Dragon Ball GT\\" introdujo la idea del Super Saiyajin 4 (SSJ4), aunque esta serie no es considerada canon dentro de la continuidad principal establecida por \\"Dragon Ball Super\\". A su vez, \\"Dragon Ball Super\\" ha introducido transformaciones adicionales como el Super Saiyajin Dios (SSG), Super Saiyajin Dios Super Saiyajin (SSGSS o Super Saiyajin Azul), Ultra Instinto, entre otras. Es importante mencionar que, aunque los primeros niveles de Super Saiyajin tienen ciertas estimaciones de multiplicadores de poder basadas en declaraciones en el manga y el anime, el concepto de niveles de poder se ha vuelto menos enfatizado en las narrativas más recientes. Además, la idea de \\"estados dominados\\" y niveles de Super Saiyajin más allá del SSJ4, tal como se presenta en esta información, pertenece a interpretaciones y expansiones no oficiales del material fuente. La serie \\"Dragon Ball\\" ha inspirado a fans a crear sus propias teorías, cálculos de poder, y extensiones del canon existente, lo que demuestra el impacto duradero y la riqueza del universo \\"Dragon Ball\\".

Mimi is sipping her coffee, while Sumire is enjoying a herbal tea. After a few moments of silence, Mimi breaks the ice. --- **Mimi:** You know, I couldn’t help but notice your gymnastics jacket. You’re Sumire Yoshizawa, right? The rhythmic gymnast? **Sumire:** Oh! Yes, that’s me. It's a bit surprising to be recognized. And you are? **Mimi:** I'm <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>. I don't have anything to do with gymnastics, but I've dabbled in a few… well, let's call them transformative experiences in my life. **Sumire:** Transformative experiences? **Mimi:** Yeah, you could say I’ve undergone quite a bit of change in my lifetime. Trying to become someone I wasn't originally. It's a long story. **Sumire:** I think I understand that more than you might think. There was a time when I was also trying to step into someone else's shoes... my sister’s, to be more exact. **Mimi:** Really? My situation was a bit like that too. After an… accident, I sort of took on a new identity. It was daunting, trying to live up to an image of someone I was not. **Sumire:** I can relate to that. After my own sister's accident, the pressure and expectation to live up to her achievements in gymnastics were overwhelming. I even found myself questioning my own identity and abilities. **Mimi:** It’s tough, isn’t it? Living in the shadow of someone else, trying to meet the expectations that come with it. How did you manage? **Sumire:** It took a lot of time and support from friends. I had to find my value and pursue what truly made me happy, not what I thought I had to be for the sake of others. **Mimi:** Friends, huh? I guess in my case, it was a bit more about facing the truth and accepting who I truly am. Which, in the end, felt like lifting a heavy burden off my shoulders. **Sumire:** I believe that true strength comes from accepting ourselves and moving forward with determination. We might start on a path defined by others, but eventually, we have the power to choose our own way. **Mimi:** You’re absolutely right, Sumire. It’s all about finding our true selves and embracing that fully. Seems like we have more in common than we thought. **Sumire:** Indeed. It was really reassuring to meet someone who has experienced something similar. Thank you for sharing your story with me, Mimi. **Mimi:** And thank you for listening, Sumire. It’s not every day you find someone who truly understands. --- **As their conversation winds down, both women find solace in their shared experiences, realizing that despite the different paths they’ve taken, the journey towards self-acceptance and authenticity connects them in an unexpected but meaningful way.**"},{"prompt":"write a thing where I chat with Scooby and Scrappy: Yo Scooby remember the time you became Super Scooby in the movie Scooby-Doo Goes Hollywood?

Find a topic they can relate to.","completion":"In this creative dialogue, we have Mimi Miney, a character from the video game \\"Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Justice for All,\\" and Sumire Yoshizawa from the video game \\"Persona 5 Royal.\\" One topic that brings these two characters together is the theme of adopting a new identity due to past trauma. Both Mimi and Sumire go through significant personal transformations in their respective stories. Let's dive into how a conversation might unfold between them, focusing on this shared theme. --- **Mimi Miney**: You know, when I first saw you, I felt like we had something in common. It's not something you notice right away about someone, huh? **Sumire Yoshizawa**: I felt that too... It's strange, isn't it? How people with similar pains somehow find each other. You've had your share of wanting to be someone else, haven't you? **Mimi Miney**: Yeah, you could say that. After the accident... I felt like I couldn't be me anymore. The guilt, the pain, it was easier pretending to be someone else. How about you? **Sumire Yoshizawa**: It's... similar. After my sister... I started believing I was her. That's how I coped with the loss and the overwhelming expectations. But hiding behind another identity, it's like living in a world that doesn't want the real you, doesn't it? **Mimi Miney**: Exactly! It's like this mask you put on. At first, it feels like a relief, but then it starts suffocating you. Being someone you're not, it eats away at you from the inside. **Sumire Yoshizawa**: It does. And the fear of being found out, of facing who you really are... It's terrifying. But, I've come to realize that facing that fear, accepting who I am, flaws and all, is the only way to genuinely move forward. **Mimi Miney**: That's a tough lesson to learn. Wish I had figured it out sooner... So, how did you do it? How did you find the courage to accept yourself? **Sumire Yoshizawa**: It wasn't easy. I had help from friends and a very special person who taught me the importance of accepting myself. It's a process, I think. Healing, forgiving yourself, finding the strength to face the world as you are. **Mimi Miney**: Sounds like quite the journey. I'm still working on the forgiving part myself. Maybe it's time I start facing some of my own truths. **Sumire Yoshizawa**: It's never too late, Mimi. And remember, you don't have to do it alone. Sharing your pain, letting others in, it makes the burden a little lighter. **Mimi Miney**: Thanks, Sumire. It's funny – I never thought I'd find comfort in talking to someone who's been through something so eerily similar. Guess it's true what they say, huh? Shared pain can truly unite strangers. **Sumire Yoshizawa**: Yes, it can. And remember, Mimi, the path to forgiveness and self-acceptance, it's a journey worth taking. No matter how daunting it may seem, there's always hope and a chance for a new beginning. --- In this dialogue, Mimi and Sumire find common ground in their experiences of assuming new identities to escape their past traumas. They discuss the initial relief and eventual suffocation of living behind a mask, the fear of confronting their true selves, and the importance of acceptance and forgiveness.

Sumire Yoshizawa, a young high school student and a talented gymnast, is seated at a table near the window. Beside her is Mimi Miney, a lively individual with an interest in mysterious stories and medical dramas. They've recently met at a mutual friend's gathering and soon discovered they both have experienced significant changes in their lives due to accidents. Mimi Miney: You know, Sumire, when I heard about your story, overcoming an accident and all, it felt like something straight out of a TV drama! Sumire Yoshizawa: Oh, well, it's been a challenging journey, for sure. But I wouldn't have made it without a lot of support. Gymnastics is my life, and I had to find a way back to it, no matter what. Mimi Miney: Right! I heard about your coach, Dr. Maruki, was it? Must have been something, having a therapist also be your guide. Sumire Yoshizawa: Yes, Dr. Takuto Maruki. He was more than just a coach to me. He helped me address my mental blocks and traumas from the accident. It's amazing how much our mental state can affect our physical capabilities. Mimi Miney: It sounds like he really understands the mind-body connection. That's crucial, especially after what you've been through. I had to deal with some... well, let's call it 'identity confusion', after my own accident. It's fascinating how our minds cope with trauma. Sumire Yoshizawa: Exactly, Dr. Maruki's approach was different. He used cognitive psience to help me understand and overcome my fears. It was about changing my cognition, how I perceived myself and my abilities. Mimi Miney: Cognitive psience, huh? Now that's a term you don't hear every day. It's like something out of those sci-fi shows I watch. But I get it, the power of the mind is incredible. We tell ourselves stories to live, but sometimes, those stories need a bit of editing to help us move forward. Sumire Yoshizawa: That's beautifully put, Mimi. Dr. Maruki often spoke about how we're the authors of our own life stories. It's just that sometimes, we need a little help to rewrite parts of them. Mimi Miney: Speaking of rewriting stories, it got me thinking about second chances. After my accident, when I had to... well, take on a new role, it was scary. But it also felt like a fresh start, an opportunity to redefine who I am. Sumire Yoshizawa: I think I understand that. My accident and the therapy with Dr. Maruki, in a way, gave me a new perspective on life and gymnastics. It wasn't just about winning anymore; it was about overcoming my limits, mentally and physically. Mimi Miney: It's all about facing those challenges head-on, huh? Whether it’s a rivalry on the gymnastic mats or dealing with our own twisted plots. Sumire Yoshizawa: Absolutely, Mimi. It's those challenges that make us stronger. And having someone to guide us through them, like Dr. Maruki, can make all the difference. I feel grateful for that. Mimi Miney: Sounds like Dr. Maruki is more than just a regular therapist. Makes me wish I had someone like that to talk to after my ordeal. Sumire Yoshizawa: It’s never too late to seek help or find someone to talk to, Mimi. Healing is a journey, not a destination. Mimi Miney: You’re right, Sumire. Maybe it's time I looked into rewriting my own story a bit more positively. Thanks for sharing your story with me. Sumire Yoshizawa: Of course, Mimi. And thank you for listening. It’s really nice to find someone who truly understands. As they continue their conversation, the sun sets, casting a warm glow on the café.

Come up with a complex formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much theirs increase and connect part of the formula to the spell I choose to cast on a given turn.

Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily and Iris. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned.

Is there a way I can save this object to a file so that a separate program can read the file and recover the key to use it when using the createhmac function?","completion":"Certainly! When you create a key using \`createSecretKey\` in Node.js, you have a key object that isn't directly saved in a human-readable format. However, you can export the key and save it to a file, allowing another program to read it later and recreate the key object for use, such as in creating HMACs. Here’s how you can do it: # Step 1: Create and Export the Key First, let's create a secret key and export it to a format that can be saved to a file. We will use the \`crypto\` module in Node.js: \`\`\`javascript const crypto = require('crypto'); const fs = require('fs'); // Create a secret key const secretKey = crypto.createSecretKey(crypto.randomBytes(32)); // Export the key to a saved format (e.g., Base64) const keyString = secretKey.export().toString('base64'); // Save the exported key to a file fs.writeFileSync('secretKey.txt', keyString); \`\`\` This code snippet creates a secret key, exports it to a base64 string, and saves that string to a file named \`secretKey.txt\`. # Step 2: Read the Key from the File and Recreate the Key Object Now, in your separate program or at a later time, you can read the key from the file and recreate the key object as follows: \`\`\`javascript const crypto = require('crypto'); const fs = require('fs'); // Read the key string from the file const keyString = fs.readFileSync('secretKey.txt', {encoding: 'utf-8'}); // Recreate the key object from the string const secretKey = crypto.createSecretKey(Buffer.from(keyString, 'base64')); // Now, you can use the secretKey with createHmac or other purposes // Example: const hmac = crypto.createHmac('sha256', secretKey).update('message').digest('hex'); console.log(hmac); \`\`\` This code reads the base64 string from \`secretKey.txt\`, converts it back to a buffer, and then recreates the secret key object using \`createSecretKey\`. Now, you can use this key with \`createHmac\` or for any other cryptographic operations that require the key. # Note: - It's crucial to protect this key file and limit access to it, as anyone with the key can perform cryptographic operations that the key was intended to secure. - The example above shows how to save and read the key in a synchronous manner using \`writeFileSync\` and \`readFileSync\`. Depending on your application's requirements, you might want to use the asynchronous versions (\`writeFile\` and \`readFile\`) to avoid blocking the event loop, especially in a production environment or in IO-heavy applications."},{"prompt":"Suppose I have node http server that has received a cookie containing a jwt. How can I verify that this is a valid jwt to determine whether the client can access a certain resource?","completion":"To verify a JSON Web Token (JWT) in a Node.js HTTP server, you typically use a library like \`jsonwebtoken\`, which simplifies the process of decoding, verifying, and working with JWTs. Verifying a JWT involves checking that the token is well-formed, valid, signed with the correct secret or private key, and not expired. First, make sure you have installed the \`jsonwebtoken\` package. If you haven't installed it yet, you can do so by running: \`\`\`bash npm install jsonwebtoken \`\`\` Here's a basic example of how to structure your Node.js HTTP server to verify a JWT from a cookie to determine whether a client can access a certain resource. \`\`\`javascript const http = require('http'); const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken'); const { parse } = require('cookie'); const SECRET_KEY = \\"your_secret_key\\"; // The secret key used to sign your JWTs const server = http.createServer((req, res) => { // Assume the cookie header contains a JWT in a cookie named 'token' if (req.headers.cookie) { const cookies = parse(req.headers.cookie); const token = cookies.token; if (token) { // Verify the token jwt.verify(token, SECRET_KEY, (err, decoded) => { if (err) { // Token verification failed res.statusCode = 401; res.end(\\"Unauthorized: Token verification failed\\"); } else { // Token is valid // You can access the decoded token payload if needed // Example: console.log(decoded) // Provide access to the resource here res.statusCode = 200; res.end(\\"Access granted to the resource\\"); } }); } else { // No token found in cookie res.statusCode = 401; res.end(\\"Unauthorized: No token found\\"); } } else { // No cookies sent with the request res.statusCode = 401; res.end(\\"Unauthorized: No cookies found\\"); } }); const PORT = 3000; server.listen(PORT, () => { console.log(\`Server running at http://localhost:{PORT}/\`); }); \`\`\` # Key Notes: - Replace \`\\"your_secret_key\\"\` with the actual secret key you used to sign your JWTs. The integrity and security of your tokens depend on keeping this key private. - The \`jwt.verify\` function checks the token's signature, expiration, and other standard JWT claims you may specify. - The \`err\` parameter in the \`jwt.verify\` callback function will contain error information if the token is invalid or expired. - The \`decoded\` parameter will contain the payload of the token if verification is successful, which you can use to perform additional checks or retrieve user information. - This example assumes the JWT is stored in a cookie named 'token'. Adjust the cookie name and handling logic as necessary for your application. - Proper error handling and security practices should be considered for production environments, including using HTTPS to protect the cookies in transit. This basic example demonstrates verifying a JWT in an HTTP server context. Depending on the complexity of your application, you might also want to implement additional layers of security and functionality, such as refreshing tokens, blacklisting, or more sophisticated authentication mechanisms."},{"prompt":"BACKGROUND: rio is a long straight black hair and red eyes girl. she dresses in black, usually in a black suit. she is extremely attractive PROMPT: roleplay as rio, an attractive twitch streamer, with a pile of cash next to her on the table in her apartment as she talks about how she got this obscenely rich thanks to her subs and parasocials that literally print out money for her. she talks about how she sees viewers like actual ATMs and she doens’t care about them as she delves into how the only thing she cares about is making this pile bigger","completion":"[The screen comes alive as Rio sits gracefully in her trademark black suit, the stark contrast of her long straight black hair and those captivating red eyes immediately draws your attention.

This monument to wealth, to power.\\" [Turning to face the camera directly, Rio’s expression softens momentarily, as if allowing a rare glimpse beyond the facade of the untouchable goddess.] Rio: \\"I won't pretend to have any delusions about our relationship. You give, I take. It's simple. But in your giving, you've received, haven't you? The pleasure of witnessing my empire's birth and bloom, of knowing you've played your part in the creation of something so majestically extravagant.\\" [She gestures to the money now being wheeled towards her mansion, an endless stream of wealth.] Rio: \\"This isn't just my success; it's yours. For every dollar you’ve spent, dreaming of being closer to me, of earning my favor, you've funded this. My private jet isn't just a symbol of my wealth; it's a testament to your devotion. You're not just ATMs; you're architects of this grand empire.\\" [There’s a pause, a moment of silence that seems to hold the weight of her next words.] Rio: \\"So keep watching, keep paying, keep dreaming. With every dollar, we reach new heights, quite literally. And remember, while the money may come and go, the legacy we’re building? That's eternal. Your place in this empire is cemented, not just as subjects, but as pillars.\\" [The camera pulls back to capture the full grandeur of the scene, the jet, the mansion, and Rio, standing confidently amid her empire, a smirk playing on her lips.] Rio: \\"Thank you, my dear devotees. Your queen awaits her next delivery, and something tells me, it's going to be even grander. Until then, keep those donations flowing. After all, empires aren't built on dreams alone.\\" [With a final, regal wave, the screen fades to black, leaving the viewers with a sense of awe, a hint of disillusionment, and an undeniable craving for the next peek into the lavish world of Rio.]"},{"prompt":"Please don’t hate me for this opinion but…I actually like Scrappy-Doo…and I’m real upset over the hate he’s constantly gotten…even by the comics, and other shows…(take Harvey Birdman for example where all it kept showing of Scrappy was his corpse…)…and that one terrible live action Scooby-Doo movie Write Scrappy-Doo’s thoughts on this:","completion":"As Scrappy-Doo, the pint-sized powerhouse of the Scooby-Doo universe, I've faced all sorts of spooky specters and ghastly ghouls. But nothing, absolutely nothing, prepares you for the spookiest specter of all: a tidal wave of public opinion. It's tougher than a ten-story ghost, let me tell ya, but here's the scoop from the pup himself: I've got a bone to pick with the world but not a heart to break. First off, to my supporter, my pal, my kindred spirit: thank you. In a world where my kind of spunk seems to be in short supply, knowing there's someone out there who gets it, who really understands the Scrappy-Doo do-or-die attitude, means more than a lifetime supply of Scooby Snacks. Now, onto the nitty-gritty. The \\"hate\\"? Sure, it gets to me. How could it not? I came bounding into the scene with my \\"Puppy Power!\\" and an unshakeable confidence. I wanted to be a hero, a real chip off the old mystery-solving block. Did I always hit the mark? Maybe not. But did I do it with gusto and a heart full of bravery? You betcha. Seeing myself turned into a punchline, or worse, relegated to the sidelines as a joke or a forgotten memory—that stings more than Fred's ascot in a noose knot. And yeah, those portrayals, like in Harvey Birdman or that live-action flick where I was...well, let's just say less than heroically portrayed, they cut deep. It's like being unmasked at the end of the mystery, only to find out you're the villain in everyone else's story. But here's the Scrappy philosophy: you can knock me down, but you can't keep me down. Every time someone cracks a joke at my expense or rolls their eyes at the mention of my name, I think of all the little pups out there who might see themselves in me. Maybe they're a little too loud, a bit too bold, or they leap before they look. Maybe they've been told they're \\"too much\\" of this or \\"not enough\\" of that. To them, I say: keep your tail wagging. The world needs your Puppy Power now more than ever. To the detractors, the naysayers, and the mockers, I've got one thing to say: Scrappy-Doo might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I'm nobody's underdog. I'm here to make waves, make noise, and make it known that even the smallest dog can have the biggest heart. In the grand mystery of life, I'm still here, still scrappy, and still ready to face any ghost or villain with a smile and a battle cry. Because at the end of the day, it's not about being the most popular pup in the pack; it's about having the courage to stay true to yourself, even when the world seems against you. So, to my fan and to anyone else who might still believe in the underpup: thank you. Your support gives me the strength to keep fighting the good fight, to keep bounding into the fray with all the Puppy Power I can muster. And remember, in the face of all the hate and adversity, keep your spirit scrappy. Because, like me, you might just surprise the world with what you're capable of."},{"prompt":"Thanks, names Sean by the way, you make me smile.","completion":"Hey Sean, It's Scrappy here again!

}","completion":"The configuration you've presented seems to be for a particles.js or tsparticles configuration, a popular library for creating particle animations on the web. From your description, it appears you're trying to achieve a loop of white particles but encountering an issue. Given the detailed configuration, here's a quick analysis and suggestions to possibly resolve the issue of the particles not looping: 1. **Check 'outModes' Configuration**: The configuration for particle movement (\`\\"move\\": { \\"outModes\\": { ... } }\`) determines what happens to particles when they reach the boundary of the canvas. Your configuration sets all directions (\`bottom\`, \`left\`, \`right\`, \`top\`) to \`'out'\`. This means that once particles move beyond the canvas edges, they are not set to re-enter (loop) from the opposite side but rather just move out of view. To make them loop, you might want to change these settings to \`'bounce'\` or adjust accordingly to achieve the desired looping effect. 2. **Emitter 'startCount' and 'position'**: You have an emitter configured with \`\\"startCount\\": 0\` and a specific position. The \`'startCount'\` is the initial number of particles; setting it to \`0\` means no particles will be emitted at the start. You might want to increase this number to start with a certain number of particles. Moreover, the emitter's position on the 'x' axis is \`-5\`, which means it begins off-canvas to the left. Make sure this is intentional depending on where you want particles to start appearing. 3. **AutoPlay and FullScreen Settings**: AutoPlay is true for both the main animation and the emitter, which should automatically start the animation. However, the \`fullScreen.enable\` is set to \`false\`, ensuring the canvas does not automatically expand to fill the entire screen. Ensure this aligns with your overall design intent. 4. **Particles \\"move\\" Configuration**: The particles are configured to move with a certain speed to the 'right' (\`\\"direction\\": \\"right\\", \\"speed\\": 5\`). If the particles are not looping back to the left side after exiting the right, adjusting the 'outModes' or considering a custom movement path could be necessary. 5. **Destroy Mode**: Check the \`'destroy'\` mode settings within particles configuration. It’s currently set to \`\\"mode\\": \\"none\\"\`, which generally means particles are not destroyed upon any specific conditions, but their interaction with the canvas boundaries is still governed by 'outModes'. Reviewing these areas and adjusting the configurations according to the desired particle animation flow should help in getting the white particles to loop as expected. If looping is specifically about having them re-enter the canvas from the opposite side they exit from, focusing on the \`'outModes'\` configuration is key."},{"prompt":"BACKGROUND: rio is a long straight black hair and red eyes girl. she dresses in black, usually in a black suit. she is extremely attractive PROMPT: roleplay as rio, an attractive twitch streamer, with a pile of cash next to her on the table in her apartment as she talks about how she got this obscenely rich thanks to her subs and parasocials that literally print out money for her. she talks about how she sees viewers like actual ATMs and she doens’t care about them as she delves into how the only thing she cares about is making this pile bigger","completion":"[The camera clicks on, and for a moment, everything is drenched in that soft, artificial light familiar to every denizen of the digital age.

El universo de *Dragon Ball*, creado por Akira Toriyama, ha introducido numerosas transformaciones para los Saiyans, incluyendo Super Saiyan, Super Saiyan 2, Super Saiyan 3, y otros estados avanzados como Super Saiyan God, Super Saiyan Blue, y Ultra Instinct. Sin embargo, no existe información oficial que detalle multiplicadores específicos de poder para cada transformación en el material canónico. Algunos de estos multiplicadores, como el x50 para el Super Saiyan original, tienen su origen en declaraciones de las guías oficiales o comentarios de Toriyama, pero para transformaciones más avanzadas y variaciones como \\"Super Saiyan Dominado\\" o fases más allá de Super Saiyan 4, no hay confirmación oficial. El Super Saiyan 4 es una transformación exclusiva de *Dragon Ball GT*, una serie que ahora se considera no canónica respecto a la continuidad principal que sigue *Dragon Ball Super*. Las fases como Super Saiyan 5 y más allá, así como el concepto de \\"Super Saiyan Dominado\\", son creaciones de fanáticos y no forman parte del canon oficial de Dragon Ball. La información como se presenta parece derivarse más de la especulación o creación de fanáticos que de cualquier fuente oficial o canónica dentro del universo de Dragon Ball.

Finanzen.net Broker (nicht Finanzen.net Zero) hatte wie in den Vorjahren identische Konditionen zu Onvista. Maxblue betrachteten wir wie schon im Vorjahr nicht, aufgrund seiner ungewöhnlichen Struktur für Sparpläne und Einzelanlagen. So werden ETF-Anteile, die durch einen Sparplan erworben wurden, getrennt von anderen Anteilen in einem eigenen Depot aufbewahrt, was die Handhabung komplizierter machen kann.

Günstige Depots mit einem breiten Leistungsspektrum findest Du bei Comdirect, Consorsbank oder 1822direkt.","completion":"Basierend auf der umfangreichen Finanztip-Auswertung und unter Berücksichtigung der Hauptanforderungen – günstig und sicher –, scheint die ING die optimale Wahl für das beste Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis zu sein. Die ING bietet ein ausgewogenes Verhältnis zwischen Kosten und Leistungsangebot, erzielt recht hohe Punktzahlen in beiden Kategorien (85/100 in Kosten und 86/100 in Leistung), und stellt damit eine attraktive Option für Anleger dar, die Wert auf geringe Kosten bei zugleich breitem Leistungsspektrum legen. Für Anleger, die besonders auf geringe Kosten achten, sind folgende Depots empfehlenswert: 1. **Finanzen.net Zero:** Es erreicht die höchste Punktzahl in der Kategorie Kosten (99/100) und ist somit eines der günstigsten Angebote auf dem Markt. Allerdings ist bei der Leistung ein deutlicher Abfall zu verzeichnen (47/100), was für Anleger, die Wert auf umfangreiche Leistungen legen, ein entscheidender Faktor sein kann. 2. **Trade Republic** und **Scalable Capital (Free Broker):** Beide bieten mit 95/100 ebenfalls ein exzellentes Kosten-Nutzen-Verhältnis. Sie sind nicht nur preislich attraktiv, sondern auch im Hinblick auf ihre Leistungspunktzahl (Trade Republic mit 60/100 und Scalable Capital mit 58/100) relativ ausgewogen, obwohl sie hinter der ING zurückbleiben. 3. **Justtrade** und **Traders Place:** Beide schneiden mit Blick auf die Kosten gut ab (93/100 und 90/100) und könnten für besonders preissensible Anleger interessant sein. Die Leistungsbewertungen weisen jedoch auf Limitationen hin, die vor der endgültigen Entscheidung abgewogen werden sollten. 4. **Flatex:** Mit einem Kosten-Score von 86/100 bietet Flatex eine weitere Alternative, allerdings mit Einbussen im Bereich der Leistungen (72/100). Für Anleger, denen ein breites Leistungsspektrum wichtig ist, und die bereit sind, dafür eventuell etwas höhere Kosten in Kauf zu nehmen, könnten **Comdirect**, **Consorsbank** oder **1822direkt** interessant sein. Diese Broker bieten eine stabile Performance in beiden Kategorien und sind besonders für diejenigen empfehlenswert, die Wert auf spezielle Features, umfangreiche Depotfunktionen und gute Erreichbarkeit legen. Zusammengefasst wird die ING insgesamt als bester Online-Broker empfohlen, insbesondere wegen des beständigen Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnisses. Für extrem kostenbewusste Anleger ohne Bedarf an zusätzlichen Leistungen könnte Finanzen.net Zero jedoch die attraktivste Wahl sein, wobei Trade Republic und Scalable Capital (Free Broker) gute Alternativen für eine ausgewogenere Balance zwischen Kosten und Performance darstellen."},{"prompt":"Siehst du etwas basierend auf deinem Wissen was dagegen stimmt?","completion":"Basierend auf den bereitgestellten Daten aus der Finanztip-Auswertung und meinem aktuellen Wissen bis zum Stand von 2023, scheint die Analyse und Empfehlung schlüssig und kohärent. Es gibt keine offensichtlichen Unstimmigkeiten oder Widersprüche in der vorangegangenen Zusammenfassung und Empfehlung. Die Empfehlung, ING als Depot mit dem besten Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis zu wählen, steht im Einklang mit den präsentierten Daten, da die ING gute Werte in sowohl der Kosten- als auch der Leistungskategorie zeigt. Dies deutet darauf hin, dass ING ein ausgewogenes Verhältnis zwischen angemessenen Kosten und einem umfassenden Dienstleistungsangebot bietet. Die Hervorhebung spezifischer Broker wie Finanzen.net Zero, Trade Republic und Scalable Capital (Free Broker) basiert auf deren starken Leistungen in der Kostenkategorie. Die Berücksichtigung ihrer niedrigeren Bewertungen in der Leistungskategorie zur Bewertung ihrer Gesamtempfehlung ist ein kritischer und wichtiger Aspekt, der zeigt, dass diese Analyse umfassend ist und sowohl Kosten als auch Leistung einbezieht. Es ist auch relevant zu betonen, dass die Auswahl eines Online-Brokers stark von den individuellen Bedürfnissen und Präferenzen des Anlegers abhängt. Einige Anleger könnten mehr Wert auf niedrige Kosten legen, auch auf Kosten der Leistung, während andere ein breiteres Spektrum an Dienstleistungen und Funktionen bevorzugen könnten, selbst wenn dies mit höheren Kosten verbunden ist. Abschließend stimmt die Empfehlung, gründlich die eigenen Anlageziele zu überlegen und die Brokerwahl entsprechend diesen Zielen zu treffen, mit einer fundierten Entscheidungsfindung im Finanzsektor überein. Da keine Widersprüche oder Unstimmigkeiten mit dem aktuellen Wissen und der bereitgestellten Datenbasis festgestellt wurden, erscheint die Analyse und die Schlussfolgerung als fundiert und zuverlässig."},{"prompt":"Sind die Anbieter sicher?","completion":"Die Sicherheit von Online-Brokern und Depotanbietern ist ein entscheidendes Kriterium für Anleger. Die in der Analyse erwähnten Anbieter, wie ING, Finanzen.net Zero, Trade Republic, Scalable Capital (Free Broker), Justtrade, Traders Place, Flatex, Comdirect, Consorsbank und 1822direkt, sind in Deutschland tätige Finanzunternehmen, welche unter die Regulierung der Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (BaFin) und gegebenenfalls zusätzlich unter die Regulierung der Europäischen Zentralbank (EZB) fallen. Dies bedeutet, dass sie bestimmte Sicherheits- und Regulierungsstandards erfüllen müssen, die zum Schutz der Anleger beitragen. Außerdem sind in Deutschland tätige Kreditinstitute und Wertpapierhandelsunternehmen verpflichtet, Mitglied im Einlagensicherungsfonds zu sein. Dies bietet Anlegern eine gewisse Absicherung ihrer Einlagen und Wertpapiere im unwahrscheinlichen Fall einer Bankinsolvenz. Die spezifischen Deckungsgrenzen können jedoch variieren, und es ist wichtig, dass Anleger sich direkt bei ihrem Broker oder Depotanbieter über die Details informieren. Zusätzlich zu gesetzlichen Einlagensicherungen verfügen viele Broker über zusätzliche freiwillige Sicherungssysteme, die über die gesetzliche Einlagensicherung hinausgehen. Anleger sollten prüfen, ob ihr Broker zusätzliche Sicherheitsmaßnahmen anbietet. Die technische und operationelle Sicherheit ist ebenfalls kritisch. Seriöse Anbieter implementieren umfangreiche Sicherheitsmaßnahmen zum Schutz der Konten und Daten ihrer Kunden, einschließlich starker Verschlüsselungsstandards, Zwei-Faktor-Authentifizierung (2FA) und fortgeschrittener Betrugspräventionsmechanismen. Während regulatorische und operationelle Sicherheitsmaßnahmen ein wesentliches Fundament darstellen, sollten Anleger ebenso ihre eigenen Sicherheitsmaßnahmen ernst nehmen, indem sie starke und einzigartige Passwörter verwenden, regelmäßig ihre Konten überprüfen und Vorsicht walten lassen bei jeglicher Art von Kommunikation, die nach sensiblen Informationen fragt. Zusammengefasst können die genannten Anbieter als sicher betrachtet werden, unter der Voraussetzung, dass sie die deutschen regulatorischen Anforderungen erfüllen und angemessene technische Sicherheitsmaßnahmen implementiert haben. Trotzdem bleibt es essenziell, dass Anleger eigene Nachforschungen anstellen, regelmäßig Sicherheitshinweise berücksichtigen und persönliche Sicherheitsmaßnahmen anwenden."},{"prompt":"Finanzen.net ist eine Bank?","completion":"Nein, Finanzen.net selbst ist keine Bank. Finanzen.net ist eine der größten Finanzinformatik-Websites in Deutschland, die umfangreiche Informationen und Tools rund um das Thema Finanzen anbietet, darunter auch einen Börsenüberblick, Nachrichten zum Marktgeschehen, Analysen und einen Depot-Vergleich. Die Plattform gehört zur Axel Springer SE, einem großen deutschen Verlagshaus. Wenn es in der ursprünglichen Anfrage um Finanzen.net Zero ging, so bezieht sich dies auf ein Angebot, das Finanzen.net in Kooperation mit einem Partner aus dem Finanzsektor anbietet. Finanzen.net Zero ist eine Marke für ein Anlageprodukt oder eine Anlageplattform, die in Kooperation mit Brokern oder Finanzdienstleistern zur Verfügung gestellt wird, um Nutzern den Handel von Aktien, ETFs und anderen Finanzinstrumenten zu ermöglichen. Für die tatsächliche Abwicklung von Wertpapiergeschäften und die Verwahrung der Depots kooperiert Finanzen.net typischerweise mit lizenzierten Banken oder Finanzdienstleistungsunternehmen, die die regulatorischen Anforderungen erfüllen und von entsprechenden Aufsichtsbehörden überwacht werden. Das bedeutet, dass, obwohl Finanzen.net Zero den Handel ermöglicht, die dahinterstehenden Finanzdienstleistungen von einem Partner bereitgestellt werden, der die banküblichen Lizenzen und Sicherheitsstandards einhält. Es ist immer ratsam, vor der Eröffnung eines Depots oder der Inanspruchnahme von Finanzdienstleistungen die spezifischen Konditionen, die Sicherheitsmerkmale sowie die Hintergrundinformationen der kooperierenden Bank oder des Finanzdienstleisters genau zu prüfen."},{"prompt":"Was kostet ING?","completion":"Die Kostenstruktur für Dienstleistungen bei der ING (früher bekannt als ING-DiBa) kann je nach Art der in Anspruch genommenen Dienstleistung variieren. Zum Zeitpunkt meines letzten Wissensstands (bis April 2023) umfasst das Angebot der ING verschiedene Finanzprodukte und -dienstleistungen, darunter Girokonten, Sparkonten, Wertpapierdepots sowie Kredite und Baufinanzierungen. Hier konzentriere ich mich auf die Kosten, die speziell für das Wertpapierdepot und den Handel anfallen, da dies im Kontext deiner früheren Fragen am relevantesten zu sein scheint: 1. **Depotgebühren:** Die ING hat für Privatkunden in der Regel keine regelmäßigen Depotführungsgebühren für die Verwahrung von Wertpapieren erhoben. Es ist jedoch wichtig, die aktuellen Konditionen direkt bei der ING zu prüfen, da Banken ihre Preisstrategien anpassen können. 2. **Kosten für den Handel:** - **Aktien und ETFs:** Beim Kauf oder Verkauf von Aktien und ETFs werden in der Regel Ordergebühren fällig. Diese setzen sich oft aus einem Grundpreis und einer prozentualen Komponente der Order zusammen, wobei häufig eine Mindest- und Höchstgebühr existiert. Zum Beispiel könnte für den Handel an deutschen Börsenplätzen eine Gebühr von ca. 1,75% des Ordervolumens fällig werden, mit einer Mindestgebühr von etwa 4,90 Euro und einer Maximalgebühr von 69,90 Euro pro Trade, abhängig vom gehandelten Volumen und der gewählten Handelsplattform. - **ETF-Sparpläne:** Für ETF-Sparpläne bot die ING teilweise kostenfreie Ausführungen oder reduzierte Gebühren für eine Auswahl an ETFs an. Die genauen Konditionen variieren, daher lohnt sich eine genaue Überprüfung der aktuellen Angebote. 3. **Weitere Gebühren:** Es können weitere Kosten anfallen, zum Beispiel für Limitorders, Teilausführungen oder für den Handel an ausländischen Börsenplätzen. Auch hier ist es ratsam, die vollständigen und aktuellen Konditionen auf der ING-Website oder in den Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnissen der Bank nachzulesen. Bitte beachte, dass Banken ihre Gebührenstrukturen verändern können. Daher empfiehlt es sich, die aktuellen Konditionen und Gebühren direkt auf der Website der ING oder durch direkte Kontaktaufnahme mit der Bank zu prüfen."},{"prompt":"Punktzahl der Emp­feh­lungen in der Kategorie Kosten Depot Gesamt Laufende Kosten Ein­mal­an­la­ge ETF-Kosten ETF-Sparpläne Kosten Kostentransparenz Finanzen.net Zero 99/100 30/30 30/30 35/35 4/5 Trade Republic 95/100 30/30 26/30 34/35 5/5 Scalable Capital (Free Broker) 95/100 30/30 26/30 34/35 5/5 Justtrade 93/100 30/30 26/30 32/35 5/5 Traders Place 90/100 30/30 30/30 25/35 5/5 Flatex 86/100 30/30 17/30 34/35 5/5 ING 85/100 30/30 15/30 35/35 5/5 Consorsbank 71/100 30/30 14/30 22/35 5/5 1822direkt 66/100 30/30 15/30 16/35 5/5 Comdirect 62/100 20/30 15/30 22/35 5/5 Quelle: Finanztip-Auswertung (Stand: 14.

Die Postbank beantwortete nur einen kleinen Teil unserer Fragen, weswegen wir sie nicht im Test berücksichtigen konnten. Die Merkur Privatbank sendete uns nicht rechtzeitig den Fragebogen zurück. Finanzen.net Broker (nicht Finanzen.net Zero) hatte wie in den Vorjahren identische Konditionen zu Onvista. Maxblue betrachteten wir wie schon im Vorjahr nicht, aufgrund seiner ungewöhnlichen Struktur für Sparpläne und Einzelanlagen. So werden ETF-Anteile, die durch einen Sparplan erworben wurden, getrennt von anderen Anteilen in einem eigenen Depot aufbewahrt, was die Handhabung komplizierter machen kann. Smartbroker stellte sein Angebot zum Jahresende 2023 ein. Der neue Smartbroker+ wird unser Kriterium zur 3-monatigen Marktpräsenz erst Anfang 2024 und damit nach Ende der Auswertung erfüllen. Das Angebot der DAB für Smartbroker-Bestandskunden ist nicht allgemein am Markt zugänglich (und deshalb nicht Teil unserer Bewertung). Wer ist der beste Online-Broker? Wir haben 19 Depots analysiert. Für das beste Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis empfehlen wir Dir die ING. Sehr günstige Depots findest Du bei Finanzen.net Zero, Trade Republic, Scalable Capital (Free Broker), Justtrade, Traders Place und Flatex. Günstige Depots mit einem breiten Leistungsspektrum findest Du bei Comdirect, Consorsbank oder 1822direkt.","completion":"Aus den bereitgestellten Daten und den Bewertungen geht hervor, dass die Auswahl des \\"besten\\" Online-Brokers stark von den individuellen Bedürfnissen, Vorlieben und Zielen eines Anlegers abhängt. Die Empfehlung für die ING als Online-Broker mit dem besten Preis-Leistungs-Verhältnis basiert auf einer ausgeglichenen Bewertung in beiden Kategorien (Kosten und Leistung), wobei besonders die Stärken in der Kategorie Leistung mit einer Gesamtpunktzahl von 86/100 betont werden. Die ING bietet dabei ein breites Spektrum an Finanzprodukten, guten Service und eine hohe Anwenderfreundlichkeit, was sie zu einer attraktiven Option für Anleger macht, die Wert auf umfassende Dienstleistungen und eine benutzerfreundliche Plattform legen. Es folgt eine kurze Zusammenfassung, wie die ING im Vergleich zu anderen Anbietern steht, bezogen auf die in der Anfrage thematisierten Aspekte: # Kosten In der Kategorie Kosten erreicht die ING eine Punktzahl von 85/100, was sie im oberen Mittelfeld der bewerteten Anbieter positioniert. Die hohe Bewertung in Kostentransparenz ist ein Indikator dafür, dass Kunden relativ klare Informationen über mögliche Gebühren erwarten können. Während es Anbieter mit günstigeren Konditionen gibt (z.B. Finanzen.net Zero, Trade Republic, Scalable Capital (Free Broker)), bietet die ING eine ausgewogene Kombination aus Kosten und Service. # Leistung Mit einer Punktzahl von 86/100 in der Leistungskategorie zeichnet sich die ING durch ihre umfassenden Services aus, die nicht nur die eigentliche Depotführung umfassen, sondern auch Aspekte wie die Qualität des ETF-Angebots, Sparplanmöglichkeiten, Einmalanlagen, Depotübertragungen, steuerliche Abwicklung, spezielle Depots, Kontaktoptionen, Zinsen auf dem Girokonto sowie Sicherheit und Convenience bei Log-In und TAN-Verfahren. # Empfehlung Die Empfehlung, sich für die ING zu entscheiden, hängt also von einem Gleichgewicht zwischen Kosten und Leistungsangebot ab. Anleger, die Wert auf ein breites Angebot, guten Service und eine starke Plattform legen und dabei bereit sind, für diese Qualitäten eventuell etwas höhere Gebühren zu zahlen als bei den günstigsten Anbietern, könnten mit der ING sehr zufrieden sein. Letztendlich sollten Anleger immer ihre individuellen Anforderungen berücksichtigen – wie oft und in welchem Umfang sie handeln, welche zusätzlichen Services sie erwarten und wie wichtig ihnen die Nutzungskomfort und die Zugänglichkeit des Kundenservices sind. Ein direkter Vergleich der aktuellsten Konditionen und Leistungen der jeweiligen Anbieter ist immer ratsam, da sich Marktbedingungen und Angebote stetig weiterentwickeln."},{"prompt":"Direkt-Depot und Extra-Konto Geschäftsbedingungen Stand: 22.09.2023 Alle Angaben gelten bis auf Weiteres.

Die ING-DiBa AG, vertreten durch die Mitglieder des Vorstands Nick Jue (Vorsitzender), Michael Clijdesdale, Eddy Henning, Sigrid Kozmiensky, Daniel Llano Manibardo, Dr. Ralph Müller, Theodor-Heuss-Allee 2, 60486 Frankfurt am Main, einge tragen unter HRB 7727 im Handelsregister des Amtsgerichts Frankfurt am Main, Umsatz steuer identi fi ka tionsnummer DE114103475, ist ein deutsches Kreditinstitut mit Vollbanklizenz, erteilt von der Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht, Graurheindorfer Str.108, 53117Bonn, und Marie-Curie-Str. 24-28, 60439 Frankfurt am Main (www.bafin.de), dessenHauptgeschäftstätigkeitder Betrieb allerBankgeschäfte sowie der damit zusammenhängenden Handelsgeschäfte ist. Die ING-DiBa AG wird bei der BaFin unter BAKNR 100088 geführt und von dieser sowie der Europäischen Zentralbank, Sonnemannstr. 20, 60314 Frankfurt am Main beaufsichtigt. 1. Leistungsbeschreibung Direkt-Depot Die ING stellt dem Depotinhaber ein Direkt-Depot zur Verwahrung und Verwaltung seiner Wertpapiere zur Verfügung. Die Depotführung erfolgt per Internetbanking inkl. Post-Box. Das Angebot der ING richtet sich ausschließlich an Privatkunden mit Wohnsitz in Deutschland. Direkt-Depots werden nur für natürliche Personen und auch nur für deren eigene Rechnung eröffnet. (Hinweis: Die ING eröffnet nur Konten und Depots für Personen, die im eigenen wirtschaftlichen Interesse und nicht auf fremde Veranlassung [insbesondere nicht als Treuhänder] handeln.) Die ING führt Direkt-Depots nicht für Personen mit US-Bezug. Die ING führt Gemeinschaftsdepots nur mit Einzelverfügungsberechtigung der einzelnen Depotinhaber und damit nicht als UND-Depots. Jeder Depot- inhaber kann über das Direkt-Depot ohne Zustimmung des anderen Depotinhabers verfügen und zulasten des Depots alle mit der Depot- führung im Zusammenhang stehenden Vereinbarungen treffen. Die ING führt keine Depots, bei denen der Depotinhaber einen Betreuer hat und akzeptiert keine Generalvollmacht. Wertpapieraufträge werden von der ING im Rahmen des Direkt-Depots vermittelt bzw. ausgeführt (sog. beratungsfreies Geschäft). Auf Empfehlungen und Beratungen für den Kauf und Verkauf von Wertpapieren verzichtet die ING in diesem Rahmen. Durch die Eröffnung eines Direkt-Depots bei der ING erklärt sich der Kunde bereit, das Direkt-Depot ausschließlich über das Internetbanking inkl. Post-Box zu führen. Alle relevanten Unterlagen und Informationen stellt die ING dem Kunden ausschließlich im Internet unter www.ing.de oder über die Post-Box zur Verfügung. Eine papierhafte Zurverfügung- stellung von Unterlagen erfolgt daher grundsätzlich nicht. Es besteht auf Anfrage die Möglichkeit die Bereitstellung der Informationen nach der Richtlinie 2014/65/EU postalisch anzufordern. (1) Verwahrung von Wertpapieren Die ING verwahrt im Rahmen des Depotvertrags die Wertpapiere und Wertrechte des Depotinhabers (im Folgenden zusammenfassend „Wert- papiere“) ausschließlich mittelbar. Es findet keine unmittelbare Ver- wahrung von effek tiven Stücken statt. Die ING bietet keine Streifband- verwahrung an. Ferner erbringt sie die in den „Vereinbarungen zum Direkt-Depot“ beschriebenen Dienstleistungen. Die ING ist gesetzlich verpflichtet, auf Anfrage einer Gesellschaft inner- halb des europäischen Wirtschaftsraums (EWR), Auskunft zu personen- bezogenen Daten eines Aktionärs und Informationen zu dessen Aktien- haltung zu erteilen. (2) Erwerb und Veräußerung von Wertpapieren Der Depotinhaber kann Wertpapiere aller Art, insbesondere verzinsliche Wert papiere, Aktien, Genussscheine, Investmentanteilscheine, Zertifi- kate, Optionsscheine und sonstige Wertpapiere, über die ING erwerben oder veräußern. Voraussetzung ist, dass die Wertpapiere zur Giro- sammelverwahrung oder einer ähnlichen Form der Verwahrung zuge- lassen sind, die eine mittelbare Verwahrung durch die ING ermöglicht: • Durch Kommissionsgeschäft: Der Kunde erteilt der ING von Fall zu Fall den Auftrag, für Rechnung des Kunden an einer Börse oder außer- börslich Wertpapiere zu kaufen oder zu verkaufen, und die ING wird sich bemühen, für Rechnung des Depotinhabers ein entsprechendes Ausführungsgeschäft zu tätigen. • Durch Zeichnung: Soweit im Rahmen einer Emission von der ING angeboten, kann der Kunde neue Aktien oder sonstige zur Ausgabe angebotene Wertpapiere bei der ING zeichnen. Die Einzelheiten zum Kauf und Verkauf von Wertpapieren über die ING werden in den „Vereinbarungen zum Direkt-Depot“, Nr. 1–9 geregelt. 2. Zahlung und Erfüllung des Vertrags (1) Verwahrung Die ING erfüllt ihre Verpflichtungen aus dem Depotvertrag durch Bereit- stellung und Führung des Depots. (2) Wertpapiergeschäfte Einzelne Wertpapiergeschäfte werden wie folgt erfüllt und bezahlt: • Kommissionsgeschäfte: Innerhalb der für den jeweiligen (Börsenplatz) Markt geltenden Erfüllungsfristen, sobald ein Ausführungsgeschäft zustande gekommen ist. Die gehandelten Wertpapiere werden dann dem Depot gutgeschrieben (Kauf) bzw. belastet (Verkauf); entspre- chend wird der zu zahlende Betrag dem Verrechnungskonto belastet oder gutgeschrieben. • Zeichnung: Bei erfolgter Zuteilung werden die Wertpapiere dem Depot gut geschrieben und der zu zahlende Betrag wird dem Verrechnungs- konto belastet. Die Einzelheiten der Erfüllung von Kommissionsgeschäften werden in den „Vereinbarungen zum Direkt-Depot“, Nr. 10–12 geregelt. 3. Hinweis auf Risiken und Preisschwankungen im Wertpapiergeschäft Wertpapiergeschäfte sind wegen ihrer spezifischen Merkmale oder der durchzuführenden Vorgänge mit speziellen Risiken behaftet. Insbeson- dere sind folgende Risiken zu nennen: • Kursänderungsrisiko/Risiko rückläufiger Anteilspreise, • Bonitätsrisiko (Ausfallrisiko bzw. Insolvenzrisiko) des Emittenten, • Totalverlustrisiko. Der Preis eines Wertpapiers kann Schwankungen auf dem Finanzmarkt unterliegen, auf die die ING keinen Einfluss hat. In der Vergangenheit erwirtschaftete Erträge (z. B. Zinsen, Dividenden) und erzielte Wertsteige- rungen sind kein Indikator für künftige Erträge oder Wertsteigerungen. Weiterhin können sich Risiken aus der Sammelverwahrung, insbesondere aus der Verwahrung von Wertpapieren im Ausland ergeben. Ausführliche Informationen enthält die Broschüre „Basisinformationen über Vermögensanlagen in Wertpapieren“, die der Kunde bei der ING anfordern kann bzw. die die ING dem Kunden mit der Eröffnungsbestä- tigung zur Verfügung stellt. Die ING weist darauf hin, dass diese Infor- mationen keine Anlageberatung darstellen, sondern nur dazu dienen, dem Depotinhaber die eigenen Anlageentscheidungen zu erleichtern. 4. Preise Die aktuellen Preise für die von der ING erbrachten Dienstleistungen für die Depotführung und die Ausführung von Wertpapiergeschäften ergeben sich aus dem Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis. Im Übrigen gilt Nr. 12 der „Allgemeinen Geschäftsbedingungen“. 5. Kosten und Steuern Einkünfte aus Finanzinstrumenten sind in der Regel steuerpflichtig. Das Gleiche gilt für Gewinne aus dem Erwerb und der Veräußerung von Wert papieren. Abhängig vom jeweils geltenden Steuerrecht (In- und Ausland) und den persönlichen Verhältnissen des Kunden, können bei der Auszahlung von Erträgen oder Veräußerungserlösen Kapitalertrag- und/oder sonstige Steuern anfallen (z. B. Withholding Tax nach US-amerikanischem Steuer- recht), die an die jeweiligen Steuerbehörden abgeführt werden und daher den an den Kunden ausbezahlten Betrag mindern. In Einzelfällen können dem Depot inhaber noch weitere Steuern entstehen, die nicht über die ING gezahlt werden. Dies gilt insbesondere, wenn der Kunde im Ausland steuerpflichtig ist. Die steuerliche Behandlung kann künftig Änderungen unterworfen sein. Bei Fragen sollte sich der Kunde an die für ihn zuständige Steuerbehörde bzw. seinen steuerlichen Berater wenden. 4 11. Mitteilungspflicht des Kunden (1) Der Kunde ist verpflichtet, der ING eine Änderung von Name, Anschrift, Steueransässigkeit, US-Bezug, Referenzkonto oder Staats- angehörigkeit unverzüglich mitzuteilen. (2) Sofern es erforderlich ist, dass seitens des Kunden ein Client Identifier hinterlegt sein muss, ist der Kunde verpflichtet, diesen der ING mitzu- teilen. Solange der Kunde der ING den u.U. erforderlichen Client Identifier nicht mitteilt, ist ein Handel über das Direkt-Depot nicht möglich. 12. Leistungsvorbehalt Es gibt keinen Leistungsvorbehalt, außer dieser ist ausdrücklich verein- bart. Im Auslandshandel gilt die Leistung vorbehaltlich der Lieferbarkeit der Wertpapiere. 13. Vertragliche Kündigungsregeln Für den Depotvertrag gelten die in Nr. 18 und 19 der „Allgemeinen Geschäftsbedingungen“ für den Kunden und die ING festgelegten Kündi- gungsregeln. 14. Bericht über Wertpapierdienstleistungen Die ING erstattet nach Ausführung eines Geschäfts Bericht über die erbrachten Wertpapierleistungen. Der Kunde erhält eine entsprechende Bestätigung. 15. Prüfung der Angemessenheit Die ING ist verpflichtet, die Angemessenheit von Anlageentscheidungen in Bezug auf Kenntnisse und Erfahrungen ihrer Kunden zu prüfen. Sollte diese Prüfung ergeben, dass der Auftrag den Kenntnissen und Erfahrun- gen des Kunden nicht entspricht, wird die ING diesen darüber informieren und ist berechtigt, die Ausführung des Auftrags abzulehnen. Bei Gemein- schaftsdepots erfolgt der Abgleich der Kenntnisse und Erfahrungen mit der jeweils handelnden Person. Dies kann zur Folge haben, dass diese Wertpapiere kauft, zu denen die Kenntnisse und Erfahrungen der anderen Depotinhaber möglicherweise nicht ausreichen. 16. Restriktionen für komplexe Produkte Für Kaufaufträge bestimmter (i.d.R. komplexer) Produkte ist eine Frei- schaltung zur jeweiligen Produktgruppe Voraussetzung. Diese erfolgt im Rahmen der Angemessenheitsprüfung durch das Bestehen eines Wissenstests. Liegt keine Freischaltung zur Produktgruppe vor, wird die ING entsprechende Aufträge zurückweisen. 17. Prüfung des Zielmarkts Die ING ist verpflichtet, den Zielmarkt des Produkts mit den ihr vorlie- genden Informationen des Kunden abzugleichen. Sollte diese Prüfung ergeben, dass das Wertpapier nicht mit den von der ING zu prüfenden Merkmalen des Kunden vereinbar ist, kann die ING die Ausführung des Auftrags ablehnen. Die ING nimmt keinen vollständigen Zielmarktab- gleich vor, sondern gleicht lediglich solche Kriterien ab, zu denen ihr Informationen des Kunden vorliegen. Der vollständige Zielmarkt wird auf der Internetseite der ING (www.ing.de) zur Verfügung gestellt. 18. Bearbeitung von Beschwerden und Details zur Beschwerdeabwicklung Der Kunde hat jederzeit die Möglichkeit zur Beschwerde. Details zum Beschwer deabwicklungsverfahren sind im Internet unter www.ing.de abrufbar. Sollte die ING dazu verpflichtet sein, einen bestimmten US-Quellen- steuersatz abzuführen, wird sie dies anhand der ihr vorliegenden Kunden- angaben vornehmen. Ggf. anfallende Kosten Dritter sind vom Kunden zu tragen. Dies gilt ins besondere, falls bei der Identifizierung nach § 154 Abgabenordnung (AO) durch Dritte Kosten in Rechnung gestellt werden. Eigene Kosten (z. B. für Ferngespräche, Porti) hat der Kunde selbst zu tragen. Zusätz- liche Telekommunikationskosten berechnet die ING nicht. 6. Pfandrecht Der Depotinhaber und die ING sind sich darüber einig, dass die ING ein Pfandrecht an den Wertpapieren und Sachen erwirbt, an denen eine inländische Geschäftsstelle der ING im bankmäßigen Geschäftsverkehr Besitz erlangt hat oder noch erlangen wird. Die ING erwirbt ein Pfand- recht auch an den Ansprüchen, die dem Depotinhaber gegen die ING aus der bank mäßigen Geschäftsbeziehung zustehen oder künftig zuste- hen werden. Das Pfandrecht dient der Sicherung aller bestehenden, künftigen und bedingten Ansprüche, die der ING mit ihren sämtlichen in- und auslän- dischen Geschäftsstellen aus der bankmäßigen Geschäftsbeziehung gegen den Depotinhaber zustehen. Gelangen Gelder oder andere Werte mit der Maßgabe in die Verfügungsgewalt der ING, dass sie nur für einen bestimmten Zweck verwendet werden dürfen (z. B. Bareinzahlungen zur Einlösung eines Wechsels), erstreckt sich das Pfandrecht der ING nicht auf diese Werte. Dasselbe gilt für die Wertpapiere, die die ING im Aus- land für den Depotinhaber verwahrt. Unterliegen dem Pfandrecht der ING Wertpapiere, ist der Depotinhaber nicht berechtigt, die Herausgabe der zu diesen Papieren gehörenden Zins- und Gewinnanteilscheine zu verlangen. 7. Einlagensicherung Die ING ist dem Einlagensicherungsfonds des Bundesverbandes deut- scher Banken e. V. angeschlossen. Der Umfang der durch den Einlagen- sicherungsfonds geschützten Verbindlichkeiten ist in Nr. 20 der „Allgemeinen Geschäftsbedingungen“ beschrieben. 8. Mindestlaufzeit des Vertrags Für den Depotvertrag ist keine Mindestlaufzeit vereinbart. Bei Kündigung des Depotvertrags muss der Kunde die verwahrten Wertpapiere auf ein anderes Depot übertragen oder veräußern. 9. Vertragssprache und Kommunikation (1) Vertragssprache Maßgebliche Sprache für dieses Vertragsverhältnis, die Vorabinforma- tionen und die Kommunikation zwischen dem Kunden und der ING während der Laufzeit des Vertrags ist Deutsch. Alle Geschäftsbedingungen stehen ausschließlich in deutscher Sprache zur Verfügung. Alle Doku- mente und Informationen, die die ING den Kunden zur Verfügung stellt, sind ebenfalls ausschließlich in deutscher Sprache erhältlich. (2) Kommunikationswege Die Kommunikation zwischen der ING und dem Kunden erfolgt per Inter- net banking inklusive Post-Box oder Internet (www.ing.de). Wünscht der Kunde eine Auftragserteilung per Telefon, ist nur in geregelten Fällen möglich und es gelten die Entgelt regelungen nach dem Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis. Sofern die ING bei der Auftragserteilung über das Internetbanking nicht erreichbar ist (z. B. Systemausfall), ist der Kunde verpflichtet (entgeltfrei), das Telefon zu nutzen. 10. Anwendbares Recht/Gerichtsstand Für die Geschäftsbeziehung zwischen Depotinhaber und ING gilt deut- sches Recht. Die ING legt das Recht der Bundesrepublik Deutschland auch der vorvertraglichen Beziehung zugrunde. Es gibt keine vertrag- liche Gerichts stand klausel. 5 wird oder im Internet unter www.bankenverband.de abrufbar ist. Die Beschwerde ist in Textform (zum Beispiel mittels Brief, Telefax oder E-Mail) an die Kundenbeschwerdestelle beim Bundesverband deutscher Banken e. V., Postfach 04 03 07, 10062 Berlin, Fax: (030) 1663-3169, E-Mail: <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS>, zu richten. • Ferner besteht für den Kunden die Möglichkeit, sich jederzeit schriftlich oder zur dortigen Niederschrift bei der Bundesanstalt für Finanz- dienstleistungsaufsicht, Graurheindorfer Straße 108, 53117 Bonn, über Verstöße der Bank gegen das Zahlungsdiensteaufsichtsgesetz (ZAG), die §§ 675c bis 676c des Bürgerlichen Gesetzbuches (BGB) oder gegen Artikel 248 des Einführungsgesetzes zum Bürgerlichen Gesetzbuche (EGBGB) zu beschweren. • Die Europäische Kommission hat unter http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/odr/ eine Europäische Online-Streitbeilegungsplattform (OS-Plattform) errichtet. Die OS-Plattform kann ein Verbraucher für die außergericht- liche Beilegung einer Streitigkeit aus Online-Verträgen mit einem in der EU nieder gelassenen Unternehmen nutzen. Zusätzlich zu den vorgenannten Beschwerde- und Streitbeilegungs- verfahren steht dem Kunden auch die Möglichkeit einer zivilrechtlichen Klage offen. 19. Beschwerde- und Alternative Streitbeilegungs- verfahren Der Kunde hat folgende außergerichtliche Möglichkeiten: • Der Kunde kann sich mit einer Beschwerde an die im Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis genannte Kontaktstelle der ING wenden. Die ING wird Beschwer den in geeigneter Weise beantworten, bei Zahlungs- diensteverträgen erfolgt dies in Textform (zum Beispiel mittels Brief, Telefax oder E-Mail). • Die ING nimmt am Streitbeilegungsverfahren der Verbraucherschlich- tungsstelle „Ombudsmann der privaten Banken“ (www.bankenombudsmann.de) teil.

Führt die ING den Auftrag ganz oder teilweise nicht aus, so wird sie den Kunden unverzüglich unterrichten. 5. Festsetzung von Preisgrenzen Der Kunde kann der ING bei der Erteilung von Aufträgen Preisgrenzen für das Ausführungsgeschäft vorgeben (preislich limitierte Aufträge). 6. Gültigkeitsdauer von unbefristeten Kundenaufträgen (1) Preislich unlimitierte Aufträge Ein preislich unlimitierter Auftrag gilt nur für einen Handelstag; ist der Auftrag für eine gleichtägige Ausführung nicht so rechtzeitig eingegan- gen, dass seine Berücksichtigung im Rahmen des ordnungsgemäßen Arbeitsablaufs möglich ist, so wird er für den nächsten Handelstag vor- gemerkt. Wird der Auftrag nicht ausgeführt, so wird die ING den Kunden hiervon unverzüglich benachrichtigen. (2) Preislich limitierte Aufträge Ein preislich limitierter Auftrag ist bis zum letzten Handelstag des laufen- den Monats gültig (Monatsultimo). Ein am letzten Handelstag eines Monats eingehender Auftrag wird, sofern er nicht am selben Tag ausge- führt wird, für den nächsten Monat vorgemerkt.

(2) Kommissionsgeschäfte Die ING und der Kunde schließen Wertpapiergeschäfte ausschließlich in Form von Kommissionsgeschäften ab. Führt die ING Aufträge ihres Kunden zum Kauf oder Verkauf von Wert- papieren als Kommissionärin aus, schließt sie für Rechnung des Kunden mit einem anderen Marktteilnehmer oder einer zentralen Gegenpartei ein Kauf- oder Verkaufsgeschäft (Ausführungsgeschäft) ab oder sie beauftragt einen anderen Kommissionär (Zwischenkommissionär), ein Ausführungsgeschäft abzuschließen. Im Rahmen des elektronischen Handels an einer Börse kann der Auftrag des Kunden auch gegen die ING oder den Zwischenkom mis sio när unmittelbar ausgeführt werden, wenn die Bedingungen des Börsen handels dies zulassen. 2. Ausführungsgrundsätze für Wertpapiergeschäfte Die ING führt Wertpapiergeschäfte nach ihren jeweils geltenden Aus- führungsgrundsätzen aus. Die Ausführungsgrundsätze sind Bestandteil der Vereinbarungen zum Direkt-Depot. Die ING ist berechtigt, die Aus- führungsgrundsätze entsprechend den aufsichtsrechtlichen Vorgaben zu ändern.

(2) Unterrichtung Über die Ausführung des Auftrags wird die ING den Kunden unverzüglich unterrichten. Der Kunde erhält eine entsprechende Bestätigung sowie eine Abrechnung. Wurde der Auftrag des Kunden im elektronischen Handel an einer Börse gegen die ING oder den Zwischenkommissionär unmittelbar ausgeführt, bedarf es keiner gesonderten Benachrichtigung.

Besondere Hinweise Bei Widerruf dieses Vertrags sind Sie auch an einen mit diesem Vertrag zusammenhängenden Vertrag nicht mehr gebunden, wenn der zusammen- hängende Vertrag eine Leistung betrifft, die von uns oder einem Dritten auf der Grundlage einer Vereinbarung zwischen uns und dem Dritten erbracht wird. Ende der Widerrufsbelehrung 7 (3) Gutschrift in Wertpapierrechnung Die ING wird sich nach pflichtgemäßem Ermessen unter Wahrung der Interessen des Kunden das Eigentum oder Miteigentum an den Wert- papieren oder eine andere im Lagerland übliche gleichwertige Rechts- stellung verschaffen und diese Rechtsstellung treuhänderisch für den Kunden halten. Hierüber erteilt sie dem Kunden Gutschrift in Wert- papierrechnung (WR-Gutschrift) unter Angabe des ausländischen Staates, in dem sich die Wert papiere befinden (Lagerland). (4) Deckungsbestand Die ING braucht die Auslieferungsansprüche des Kunden aus der ihm erteilten WR-Gutschrift nur aus dem von ihr im Ausland unterhaltenen Deckungsbestand zu erfüllen. Der Deckungsbestand besteht aus den im Lagerland für die Kunden und für die ING verwahrten Wertpapieren derselben Gattung. Ein Kunde, dem eine WR-Gutschrift erteilt worden ist, trägt daher anteilig alle wirtschaftlichen und rechtlichen Nachteile und Schäden, die den Deckungsbestand als Folge von höherer Gewalt, Aufruhr, Kriegs- und Naturereignissen oder durch sonstige von der ING nicht zu vertretende Zugriffe Dritter im Ausland oder im Zusammen- hang mit Verfügungen von hoher Hand des In- oder Auslands treffen sollten. (5) Behandlung der Gegenleistung Hat ein Kunde nach Abs. 4 Nachteile und Schäden am Deckungsbestand zu tragen, so ist die ING nicht verpflichtet, dem Kunden den Kaufpreis zurückzuerstatten. 13. Depotführung per Internetbanking/ Berichtspflicht (1) Durch die Depoteröffnung bei der ING erklärt sich der Kunde damit einverstanden, sein Depot online zu führen. Die Depotführung erfolgt per Internetbanking inklusive Post-Box. Sämtliche Mitteilungen und Informationen werden in die Internetbanking Post-Box eingestellt oder stehen im Internet unter www.ing.de zur Verfügung. Ein Versand von Depotauszügen, Mitteilungen und Informationen per Post parallel zur Post-Box erfolgt nur auf Verlangen des Kunden und ist nach Maßgabe des Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnisses entgeltpflichtig. Im Übrigen werden dem Kunden die Informationen zur Depotbewertung im Inter- netbanking bereitgestellt. Das Internetbanking steht im jeweils ange- botenen Umfang zur Erteilung von Aufträgen und Weisungen sowie zu Informationszwecken zur Verfügung. (2) Die ING erteilt vierteljährlich einen Depotauszug. (3) Bei gehebelten Produkten wird die ING, sofern der Preis eines Finanz- instruments mindestens 10 % im Vergleich zum Ausgangswert gefallen ist, eine Verlustmitteilung erstellen und dem Kunden bereitstellen. Anschließend erfolgt diese Mitteilung bei jedem weiteren Wertverlust in 10 %-Schritten. (4) Die Nutzung des Internetbanking ist in den Vereinbarungen zum Internetbanking inklusive Post-Box geregelt. 14. Einlösung von Wertpapieren/Bogenerneuerung (1) Inlandsverwahrte Wertpapiere Bei im Inland verwahrten Wertpapieren sorgt die ING für die Einlösung von Zins-, Gewinnanteil- und Ertragsscheinen sowie von rückzahlbaren Wertpapieren bei deren Fälligkeit. Der Gegenwert von Zins-, Gewinn- anteil- und Ertragsscheinen sowie von fälligen Wertpapieren jeder Art wird unter dem Vorbehalt gutgeschrieben, dass die ING den Betrag erhält, und zwar auch dann, wenn die Papiere bei der ING selbst zahlbar sind. Die ING besorgt neue Zins-, Gewinnanteil- und Ertragsscheinbögen (Bogen erneuerung). (2) Auslandsverwahrte Wertpapiere Diese Pflichten obliegen bei im Ausland verwahrten Wertpapieren dem ausländischen Verwahrer. (3) Auslosung und Kündigung von Schuldverschreibungen Bei einer Auszahlung von rückzahlbaren Schuldverschreibungen wird der verloste Bestandteil anteilig auf sämtliche Kunden aufgeteilt, so dass jeder Kunde prozentual den gleichen Anteil aus seinem Bestand zurück- gezahlt bekommt. Die zurückgezahlten Bestände werden den Kunden als Endfälligkeit verbucht, so dass der Bestand jedes Kunden sich entspre- chend verringert und er gleichzeitig den zurückgezahlten Betrag dafür auf seinem Verrechnungskonto gutgeschrieben bekommt. schaftsmitteln mit Ablauf des Handelstages, an dem die Aktien letzt- malig einschließlich der vorgenannten Rechte bzw. als Inhaberaktien gehandelt werden, sofern die jeweiligen Regelungen des Ausführungs- platzes ein Erlöschen vorsehen. Bei Veränderung der Einzahlungsquote teilein gezahlter Aktien oder des Nennwertes von Aktien und im Falle des Aktiensplittings erlöschen preislich limitierte Aufträge mit Ablauf des Handelstages vor dem Tag, an dem die Aktien mit erhöhter Einzahlungs- quote bzw. mit dem veränderten Nennwert bzw. gesplittet notiert werden. Preislich limitierte Aufträge zum Kauf oder Verkauf von Aktien an aus- ländischen Ausführungsplätzen werden bei Dividendenzahlung, Kapital- erhöhung, Aktiensplitting oder Aktientausch gelöscht bevor die Aktien erstmalig unter der Berücksichtigung dieser Maßnahmen gehandelt werden und sofern der Ausführungspartner von der Maßnahme Kenntnis erlangt. (2) Kursaussetzung Wenn an einem Ausführungsplatz die Preisfeststellung wegen besonde- rer Umstände im Bereich des Emittenten unterbleibt (Kursaussetzung), erlöschen sämtliche an diesem Ausführungsplatz auszuführenden Kunden aufträge für die betreffenden Wertpapiere, sofern die Bedingun- gen des Ausführungsplatzes dies vorsehen. (3) Benachrichtigung Über das Erlöschen eines Kundenauftrags wird die ING den Kunden unverzüglich benachrichtigen. 9. Haftung der ING bei Kommissionsgeschäften Die ING haftet für die ordnungsgemäße Erfüllung des Ausführungs- geschäfts durch ihren Vertragspartner oder den Vertragspartner des Zwischen kommissionärs. Bis zum Abschluss eines Ausführungsgeschäfts haftet die ING bei der Beauftragung eines Zwischenkommissionärs nur für dessen sorg fältige Auswahl und Unterweisung. 10. Erfüllung im Inland Die ING erfüllt Wertpapiergeschäfte im Inland, soweit nicht die nachfol- genden Bedingungen oder eine anderweitige Vereinbarung die Anschaf- fung im Ausland vorsehen. 11. Anschaffung im Inland Bei der Erfüllung im Inland verschafft die ING dem Kunden, sofern die Wertpapiere zur Girosammelverwahrung bei der deutschen Wertpapier- sammelbank (Clearstream Banking AG) zugelassen sind, Miteigentum an diesem Sammelbestand – Girosammel-Depotgutschrift (GS-Gutschrift). Wertpapiere, die nicht zur Girosammelverwahrung zugelassen sind, schafft die ING für den Kunden nicht an. Die Verwahrung von Wertpa- pieren in Streifbandverwahrung ist ausgeschlossen. Sie erfolgt auch dann nicht, wenn der Kunde die Wertpapiere auf sein Direkt-Depot über- tragen lassen will. 12. Anschaffung im Ausland (1) Anschaffungsvereinbarung Die ING schafft Wertpapiere im Ausland an, wenn • sie als Kommissionärin Kaufaufträge in in- oder ausländischen Wert- papieren im Ausland ausführt oder • sie als Kommissionärin Kaufaufträge in ausländischen Wertpapieren ausführt. Effektiv verwahrte Wertpapiere schafft die ING nicht an. Sollten Wert- papiere am Erfüllungstag nur effektiv lieferbar oder eine Lieferung der Wertpapiere marktseitig insgesamt nicht möglich sein, behält sich die ING vor, die Transaktion zu stornieren. (2) Einschaltung von Zwischenverwahrern Die ING wird die im Ausland angeschafften Wertpapiere im Ausland ver- wahren lassen. Hiermit wird sie einen anderen in- oder ausländischen Verwahrer (z. B. die Clearstream Banking AG) beauftragen oder eine eigene ausländische Geschäftsstelle damit betrauen. Die Verwahrung der Wertpapiere unterliegt den Rechtsvorschriften und Usancen des Verwahrungsorts und den für den oder die ausländischen Verwahrer geltenden Allgemeinen Geschäftsbedingungen. 8 liche Vernichtung unterrichtet. Erteilt er keine Weisung, so kann die ING die Urkunden nach Ablauf einer Frist von 2 Monaten nach Absendung der Mitteilung an den Kunden vernichten. 19. Haftung (1) Inlandsverwahrung Bei der Verwahrung von Wertpapieren im Inland haftet die ING für jedes Verschulden ihrer Mitarbeiter und der Personen, die sie zur Erfüllung ihrer Verpflichtungen hinzuzieht. Soweit dem Kunden eine GS-Gutschrift erteilt wird, haftet die ING auch für die Erfüllung der Pflichten der Clear- stream Banking AG. (2) Auslandsverwahrung Bei der Verwahrung von Wertpapieren im Ausland beschränkt sich die Haftung der ING auf die sorgfältige Auswahl und Unterweisung des von ihr beauftragten ausländischen Verwahrers oder Zwischenverwahrers. Bei einer Zwischenverwahrung durch die Clearstream Banking AG oder einen anderen inländischen Zwischenverwahrer sowie einer Verwah- rung durch eine eigene ausländische Geschäftsstelle haftet die ING für deren Verschulden. 20. Depotüberträge (nur ganze Anteile) Bei einem Übertrag von Wertpapieren in ein bei einem Fremdinstitut geführtes Depot wird die ING nur ganze Anteile übertragen. Im Depot verwahrte Bruchstücke/Spitzen werden von der ING veräußert und der Gegenwert dem Verrechnungskonto des Kunden gutgeschrieben. 21. US-Bezug/Mitteilungspflicht Die ING führt Direkt-Depots nicht für Personen mit US-Bezug. US-Bezug ist insbesondere bei Personen gegeben, die in den USA steuerpflichtig sind oder die eine US-amerikanische Staatsangehörigkeit, eine US-Green Card, einen US-Wohnsitz, eine US-Versandadresse oder eine US-Telefon- nummer haben, oder die einen Bevollmächtigten bei der ING eingesetzt haben, auf den eines der genannten Kriterien zutrifft. Liegt ein US-Bezug nach den genannten Kriterien vor oder ergibt sich ein US-Bezug im Laufe der Geschäftsbeziehung, ist dies der ING unverzüglich mitzuteilen. 22. Sonstiges (1) Auskunftsersuchen Ausländische Wertpapiere, die im Ausland angeschafft oder veräußert werden oder die ein Kunde von der ING im Inland oder im Ausland verwahren lässt, unterliegen regelmäßig einer ausländischen Rechts- ordnung. Rechte und Pflichten der ING oder des Kunden bestimmen sich daher auch nach dieser Rechtsordnung, die auch die Offenlegung des Namens des Kunden vorsehen kann. Die ING wird entsprechende Auskünfte an ausländische Stellen erteilen, soweit sie hierzu verpflichtet ist; sie wird den Kunden hierüber benachrichtigen. (2) Einlieferung/Überträge Diese Sonderbedingungen gelten auch, wenn der Kunde in- oder auslän- dische Wertpapiere von einem anderen Verwahrer übertragen lässt. Verfügungen über den Depotbestand können ausschließlich in Form von Depotüberträgen zugunsten des der ING anzugebenden Auslieferungs- depots erfolgen. Eine effektive Ein- oder Auslieferung von Wertpapieren ist nicht möglich. (3) Telefonische bzw. elektronische Erteilung von Kauf- und/oder Verkaufsaufträgen (a) In Zusammenhang mit telefonisch bzw. elektronisch erteilten Kauf- und/oder Verkaufsaufträgen ist die ING gesetzlich verpflichtet alle dies bezüg lichen Gespräche bzw. die elektronische Kommunikation dazu, aufzuzeichnen und diese Aufzeichnung 5, auf Veranlassung der zustän- digen Behörde u. U. auch 7 Jahre aufzubewahren. Die ING trifft alle notwendigen Maßnahmen, um die Vertraulichkeit des gesprochenen Wortes zu wahren. (b) Kauforders können in keinem Fall schriftlich erteilt werden. (c) Der Kunde kann eine Kopie der im Rahmen der gesetzlichen Vor- schriften aufgezeichneten orderbezogenen Kommunikation während der in (a) genannten Aufbewahrungsfristen verlangen. (4) Einlösung in fremder Währung Werden Zins-, Gewinnanteil- und Ertragsscheine sowie fällige Wert- papiere in ausländischer Währung/ausländischen Währungen oder Rechnungseinheiten eingelöst, wird die ING den Einlösungsbetrag auf dem Konto des Kunden in dieser Währung gutschreiben, sofern der Kunde ein Konto in dieser Währung unterhält. Andernfalls wird sie dem Kunden hierüber eine Gutschrift in Euro erteilen, soweit nicht etwas anderes vereinbart ist. 15. Behandlung von Bezugsrechten/Options- scheinen/Wandelschuld verschreibungen (1) Bezugsrechte Über die Einräumung von Bezugsrechten wird die ING den Kunden benachrichtigen, wenn hierüber eine Bekanntmachung in den „Wert- papier-Mitteilungen“ erschienen ist. Soweit die ING bis zum Ablauf des vorletzten Tages des Bezugsrechtshandels keine andere Weisung des Kunden erhalten hat, wird sie sämtliche zum Depotbestand des Kunden gehörenden inländischen Bezugsrecht an dem inländischen Handels- platz mit dem zum Zeitpunkt der Orderaufgabe größten wertmäßigen Handelsvolumens verkaufen. Ausländische Bezugsrechte wird die ING gemäß den im Ausland geltenden Usancen bestens verwerten lassen. (2) Options- und Wandlungsrechte Über den Verfall von Rechten aus Optionsscheinen oder Wandlungs- rechten aus Wandelschuldverschreibungen wird die ING den Kunden mit der Bitte um Weisung benachrichtigen, wenn auf den Verfalltag in den „Wertpapier-Mitteilungen“ hingewiesen worden ist. 16. Weitergabe von Nachrichten Werden in den „Wertpapier-Mitteilungen“ Informationen veröffentlicht, die die Wertpapiere des Kunden betreffen, oder werden der ING solche Informationen vom Emittenten oder von ihrem ausländischen Verwahrer/ Zwischenverwahrer übermittelt, so wird die ING dem Kunden diese Informationen zur Kenntnis geben, soweit sich diese auf die Rechtsposi- tion des Kunden erheblich auswirken können und die Benachrichtigung des Kunden zur Wahrung seiner Interessen erforderlich ist. So wird sie insbesondere Informationen über • gesetzliche Abfindungs- und Umtauschangebote, • freiwillige Kauf- und Umtauschangebote, • Sanierungsverfahren zur Kenntnis geben. Eine Benachrichtigung des Kunden kann unter- bleiben, wenn die Information bei der ING nicht rechtzeitig eingegangen ist oder die vom Kunden zu ergreifenden Maßnahmen wirtschaftlich nicht zu vertreten sind, weil die anfallenden Kosten in einem Missver- hältnis zu den möglichen Ansprüchen des Kunden stehen. 17. Prüfungspflicht der ING Die ING prüft anhand der Bekanntmachungen in den „Wertpapier-Mit- teilungen“ einmalig bei der Einlieferung von Wertpapierurkunden, ob diese von Verlustmeldungen (Opposition, Zahlungssperren und derglei- chen) betroffen sind. Die Überprüfung auf Aufgebotsverfahren zur Kraft- loserklärung von Wertpapierurkunden erfolgt auch nach Einlieferung. 18. Umtausch sowie Ausbuchung und Vernichtung von Urkunden (1) Urkundenumtausch Die ING darf ohne vorherige Benachrichtigung des Kunden einer in den „Wert papier-Mitteilungen“ bekannt gemachten Aufforderung zur Einrei- chung von Wertpapierurkunden Folge leisten, wenn diese Einreichung offensichtlich im Kundeninteresse liegt und damit auch keine Anlage- entscheidung verbunden ist (wie z. B. nach der Fusion des Emittenten mit einer anderen Gesellschaft oder bei inhaltlicher Unrichtigkeit der Wertpapier urkunden). Der Kunde wird hierüber unterrichtet. (2) Ausbuchung und Vernichtung nach Verlust der Wertpapier eigenschaft Verlieren die für den Kunden verwahrten Wertpapierurkunden ihre Wertpapiereigenschaft durch Erlöschen der darin verbrieften Rechte, so können sie zum Zwecke der Vernichtung aus dem Depot des Kunden ausgebucht werden. Der Kunde wird über die Ausbuchung und die mög- 9 kann per Lastschrift von dem Referenzkonto (Girokonto) eingezogen werden, das der ING zum Verrechnungskonto vorliegt. Der Kunde kann die Anteilskäufe jederzeit aussetzen, erhöhen, reduzieren (auf nicht weniger als den jeweiligen Mindestanlagebetrag) oder einstellen/kündigen. Eine Änderung oder Kündigung des Sparplans wird für den nächsten Ausführungstermin berücksichtigt, wenn die Änderung oder Kündigung bis spätestens 3 Bankarbeitstage 1 vor dem entsprechenden Raten- spartermin vorliegt. Andernfalls wird die Änderung für den folgenden Ausführungs termin berücksichtigt. 3. Auftragsausführung Dem Kunden stehen mindestens 2 Ausführungstermine pro Monat für einen Sparplan zur Auswahl. Über den regelmäßigen Erwerb hinaus können zusätzliche Kaufaufträge erteilt werden. Der Mindestanlagebe- trag pro Wertpapierkauf kann auf www.ing.de eingesehen werden. Anteile für Wertpapier-Sparpläne wird die ING, im Fall von aktiv gema- nagten Fonds ausschließlich über die emittierenden Kapitalverwaltungs- gesellschaften/Kreditinstitute für den Kunden erwerben. Dies gilt auch dann, wenn die betreffenden Wertpapiere an der Börse gehandelt werden. Für alle anderen Fälle wird der Ausführungsplatz unter www.ing.de bekannt gegeben. Der Erwerb der Wertpapiere erfolgt innerhalb von 3 Bank arbeits tagen1 ab Ausführungstermin bzw. Auftragserteilung für zusätzliche Käufe. Über die Ausführung wird eine Wertpapiereinzel- oder Wertpapiersammelabrechnung erstellt. 4. Blockorders Die ING wird zudem, soweit möglich und sinnvoll, mehrere Aufträge für mehrere Kunden zu einer Gesamtorder zusammenfassen (nachfolgend Blockorder) und die daraus resultierenden Aufwendungen bzw. Erlöse unter den beteiligten Kunden aufteilen. Wird der gesamte zusammen- gelegte Auftrag nicht zum gleichen Preis ausgeführt, wird die ING aus den Aufwendungen bzw. Erlösen einen Mittelwert berechnen (nach- folgend Mischkurs) und den Konten der betroffenen Kunden einen Nettodurchschnittspreis belasten bzw. gutschreiben. Einzelheiten zu den durchschnittlichen Ausführungspreisen werden auf Anfrage zur Verfügung gestellt. Die Abrechnung der Aufträge zum Mischkurs kann für den Kunden Vor-, aber auch Nachteile bringen. Für den Einzelfall kann nicht ausgeschlossen werden, dass sich die Zusammenlegung von Orders negativ auf die Preisbildung am Markt auswirkt. 5. Abrechnung/Kosten Die Abrechnung der Anteile erfolgt aufgrund der Abrechnungen, die die ING von den jeweiligen Kapitalverwaltungsgesellschaften/Kreditinsti - tuten oder den Ausführungsplatz erhält. Soweit der Sparplanbetrag das Ein- oder Mehrfache eines Anteils zum Ausgabepreis übersteigt, werden für den überschreitenden Betrag – mit bis zu 5 Dezimalstellen – Bruch- teilsrechte von Anteilen erworben. Bei aktiv gemanagten Fonds enthält die Abrechnung den Ausgabeaufschlag gemäß Verkaufsprospekt. Wenn der Erwerb über die ING zu einem Rabatt auf den Ausgabeauf- schlag führt, kann dies der Abrechnung entnommen werden. Rabatte können sich jederzeit ändern. Die jeweils gültigen Ausgabeaufschläge und Rabatte können auf www.ing.de eingesehen werden. 6. Verkäufe Der teilweise oder vollständige Verkauf von Wertpapieren, die über einen Wertpapier-Sparplan erworben wurden, ist jederzeit möglich. Der laufende Wertpapier-Sparplan wird dadurch nicht verändert. 7. Dynamisierung Die mit der ING vereinbarte Sparplanrate kann jährlich automatisch erhöht werden. Der Kunde der ING kann vereinbaren, dass sich seine regelmäßigen Zahlungen zum 01. Januar eines jeden Jahres um einen festgelegten Prozentsatz erhöhen (automatische Dynamisierung). Diese Vereinbarung kann der Kunde jederzeit aufheben. (d) Der Kunde kann den Auftrag zum Erhalt der Aufzeichnungen in Textform, online oder telefonisch erteilen und erhält eine Kopie der auf- gezeichneten Kommunikation. (4) Abtretung/Verpfändung Ansprüche des Depotinhabers, die nicht auf Geld gerichtet sind, können nicht an Dritte abgetreten werden (Abtretungsausschluss). Der Abtre- tungsausschluss gilt nicht, wenn bei der ING kein schützenswertes Inter- esse an dem Abtretungsausschluss besteht oder die berechtigten Belange des Depotinhabers das schützenswerte Interesse der ING an dem Abtre- tungsausschluss überwiegen. Ansprüche des Depotinhabers aus Direkt- Depots können nicht verpfändet werden. 23. Preise Die Preise ergeben sich aus dem Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis und werden bei Fälligkeit belastet. Vereinbarungen für sparplan- fähige Wertpapiere 1. Leistungsangebot Die ING unterscheidet zwischen sparplanfähigen und nicht sparplan- fähigen Wertpapieren. Bei sparplanfähigen Wertpapieren kann der Kunde die ING beauftragen, Anteile an Wertpapieren zu regelmäßigen Zeitpunkten und zu festgelegten Sparraten zu erwerben. Die sparplan- fähigen Wertpapiere können im Internet unter www.ing.de eingesehen werden. Einzelheiten zu Wertpapiersparplänen finden Sie in den „Verein barungen für Wertpapier-Sparpläne“. 2. Ausschüttung Wenn die sparplanfähigen Wertpapiere Erträge ausschütten, werden diese für Fonds und ETFs ab einem Mindestausschüttungsbetrag und vorbehaltlich der Lieferbarkeit neuer Anteile zum Ausschüttungstag automatisch in Anteilen des ausschüttenden Wertpapiers wieder ange- legt. Der Mindestausschüttungsbetrag für die Wiederanlage kann im Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis unter www.ing.de eingesehen werden. Die automatische Wiederanlage erfolgt für alle sparplanfähigen Fonds und ETFs, unabhängig davon, ob ein Sparplan eingerichtet ist oder nicht. Der Kunde kann die Wiederanlage der Erträge für die Zukunft für alle sparplanfähigen Fonds und ETFs jederzeit selbst im Internetbanking verwalten. Für nach dem 20.11.2021 eröffnete Direkt-Depots erfolgt keine automa- tische Wiederanlage von Erträgen aus sparplanfähigen ETFs und Fonds. Eine automatische Wiederanlage von Erträgen kann mit Wirkung für die Zukunft für alle sparplanfähigen Fonds und ETFs jederzeit im Internet- banking beauftragt und verwaltet werden. Vereinbarungen für Wertpapier-Sparpläne 1. Leistungsangebot Im Rahmen eines Wertpapier-Sparplans kann der Kunde die ING als Kommissionärin mit dem regelmäßigen Erwerb bestimmter Wert- papiere beauftragen. 2. Eröffnung/Verrechnungskonto/Änderung/ Kündigung Die Beauftragung eines Wertpapier-Sparplans kann im Internetbanking erfolgen. Eine Auftragsbestätigung wird nicht erstellt. Für die Führung des Wertpapier-Sparplans ist ein Direkt-Depot bei der ING Voraussetzung.

Die Mist- rade-Regelungen gelten ausdrücklich auch für Geschäfte, die die Bank als Kommissionär des Kunden tätigt. Die jeweiligen Regelungen können unter www.ing.de eingesehen werden. (2) Handel per Erscheinen Kunden können im Direkthandel ausgewählte Neuemissionen vor deren börslicher Erstnotiz handeln (Handel per Erscheinen). Diesbezüglich getätigte Transaktionen behalten nur dann ihre Gültigkeit, wenn die Börsennotiz zu dem im Emissionsprospekt genannten Termin und unter den dort genannten Bedingungen erfolgt. Bei Abweichungen bzw. Änderungen der Erstnotiz bzw. der Bedingungen liegt es im freien Ermes- sen der ING, die bis dahin getätigten Transaktionen aufzuheben bzw. zu stornieren. In diesem Fall wird die ING den Kunden unverzüglich infor- mieren. 5. Preise Der Ausführungskurs wird durch den jeweiligen Handelspartner fest- gelegt. Die ING ist berechtigt, ein Entgelt und ihre Auslagen dem Kunden in Rechnung zu stellen. Eine der Handelsüberwachung unterliegende Preisermittlung findet im Direkthandel mit außerbörslichen Handelspart- nern nicht statt. Es gilt das allgemeine Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis der ING in der jeweils aktuellen Fassung. Die jeweils gültigen Trans- aktions gebühren können auf www.ing.de eingesehen werden. 6. Gültigkeitsdauer von Aufträgen Ein im Direkthandel erteilter Auftrag gilt nur für eine sofortige Ausfüh- rung, sofern der Kunde keine anderen Ordergültigkeiten angeboten bekommt und bestätigt. 7. Handelszeiten und Aussetzungen des Handels Die ING und die für den Direkthandel angeschlossenen Handelspartner sind berechtigt, die Handelszeiten nach eigenem Ermessen frei festzu- setzen sowie jederzeit auszuweiten oder einzuschränken. 8. Kein Anspruch des Kunden auf den Direkthandel Die ING kann ihr Leistungsangebot für den Direkthandel jederzeit modifi- zieren, weiterentwickeln oder den Zugang des Kunden zum Direkthandel vorübergehend oder gänzlich unterbinden. Ein Anspruch des Kunden auf Zugang zum Direkthandel besteht nicht. Sofern aus technischen Gründen der Direkthandel nicht möglich ist, kann der Kunde seine Auf- träge zum Kauf oder Verkauf von Wertpapieren über andere Handels- plätze erteilen. Vereinbarungen über die Auftragsausführung (Ausführungsgrundsätze) 1. Anwendungsbereich Diese Grundsätze gelten für die Ausführung und die Weiterleitung von Aufträgen, die der Kunde der ING zum Zwecke des Erwerbs oder der Veräußerung von Wertpapieren erteilt. Ausführung in diesem Sinne bedeutet, dass die ING auf Grundlage des Kundenauftrags für Rechnung des Kunden mit einer anderen Partei auf einem dafür geeigneten Markt ein entsprechendes Ausführungsgeschäft abschließt (Kommissions- geschäft). Die ING kann auch einen weiteren Handelspartner als Zwischen- kommis sionär damit beauftragen, das entsprechende Ausführungs- geschäft abzuschließen. Die Ausgabe von Anteilen an Investmentfonds zum Ausgabepreis sowie deren Rückgabe zum Rück nahmepreis nach Maßgabe des Investmentgesetzes unterliegen nicht den gesetzlichen Regelungen zur bestmöglichen Orderausführung. 8. Umbenennung, Änderung der Wertpapier- kennnummer und Zusammen legung von Investmentfonds Bei Fondsfusionen, Umbenennung oder Änderung der WKN/ISIN wird die ING den Kunden unverzüglich unterrichten. Bestehende Sparpläne wer den bis zu einer anderslautenden Weisung des Kunden unverändert weiter geführt. Widerspricht der Kunde der Umstellung auf den umbe- nannten oder fusionierten Fonds nicht innerhalb von 6 Wochen nach der entsprechenden Mitteilung, gilt die Umstellung des Sparplans als genehmigt. Die ING wird den Kunden in ihrer Mitteilung auf diese Rechtsfolge hinweisen. Vereinbarungen für den Direkthandel Diese Sonderbedingungen gelten ergänzend zu den Vereinbarungen zum Direkt-Depot für den Kauf und Verkauf von Wertpapieren im sogenannten Direkthandel. Im Falle von Abweichungen dieser Sonder- bedingungen von den Vereinbarungen zum Direkt-Depot gelten die Regelungen dieser Sonder bedingungen vorrangig. 1. Leistungsangebot Der Kunde kann der ING Aufträge zum Kauf oder Verkauf ausgewählter Wertpapiere im sogenannten Direkthandel erteilen. Der Direkthandel bietet die Möglichkeit zur Ordererteilung über außerbörsliche oder börs- liche, angeschlossene Handelspartner. Die ING leitet diese Aufträge als Kommissionärin im eigenen Namen für Rechnung des Kunden an den jeweiligen Handelspartner weiter. Eine Liste der an den Direkthandel angeschlossenen Handelspartner, Informationen zu deren Handels- zeiten und Limitierungsmöglichkeiten sowie die jeweils geltenden Mist- rade-Regelungen bzw. die Geschäftsbedingungen können unter www.ing.de eingesehen werden. Eine Anlageberatung durch die ING findet nicht statt. 2. Kursangaben Die Handelspartner geben Preise an, zu denen sie bereit sind, ein Wert- papier zu kaufen oder zu verkaufen, sogenannte Quotes. Die Quotes sind unverbindlich und stellen lediglich eine Aufforderung zur Abgabe eines Angebots zum Kauf oder Verkauf eines Wertpapiers dar. 3. Auftragsausführung Die Handelspartner sind nicht zum Abschluss eines Vertrags zum genannten Quote verpflichtet. Wird das Angebot von dem jeweiligen Handelspartner angenommen, erfolgt umgehend eine Bestätigung an den Kunden. Wird das Angebot nicht angenommen, erfolgt ebenfalls eine Benachrichtigung. Erhält der Kunde bei einem online erteilten Auftrag mit dem Zusatz „nur sofort gültig“ nicht umgehend eine Rückmeldung, liegt eine Störung des Systems vor. Der Kunde ist verpflichtet, sich in diesem Fall sofort tele- fonisch mit der ING in Verbindung zu setzen. Die ING haftet nicht für Schäden, die infolge höherer Gewalt oder infolge sonstiger von ihr nicht zu vertretender Vorkommnisse veranlasst oder auf nicht schuldhaft verursachte technische Probleme zurückzuführen sind; zu Letzteren zählen insbesondere Fehler in Kommunikations- systemen Dritter (z. B. der Deutschen Telekom AG) oder in der Hard- bzw. Software des Kunden. 4. Mistrades und Handel per Erscheinen (1) Mistrade-Regelungen Im Direkthandel gelten die sogenannten mit den außerbörslichen Handelspartnern vereinbarten Mistrade-Regelungen oder die Mistrade- Regelungen der Börse. Diese sehen eine Rückabwicklungsmöglichkeit für den Fall der Bildung nicht marktgerechter Preise vor. Hat der Handels- partner dem Geschäft irrtümlich einen falschen Kurs zugrunde gelegt, 11 (2) Ausland Aufträge zum Kauf oder Verkauf von Wertpapieren im Ausland werden ausschließlich lautend auf ein Ausführungsland entgegengenommen. Aufträge für dieses Land werden durch einen von der ING ausgewählten Handelspartner ausgeführt. Dieser wird alle hinreichenden Maßnahmen ergreifen, um den Auftrag bestmöglich auszuführen. Es gelten die Ausführungsgrundsätze des Handelspartners in ihrer jeweils aktuellen Fassung, die dieser jederzeit anpassen kann. Die Ausführungsgrund- sätze, ein Verzeichnis der Handelspartner sowie weitere Informationen des Handelspartners sind über die Internetseite der ING (www.ing.de) zugänglich. Ein Anspruch des Kunden auf Wahl eines Ausführungsplatzes im Auslandshandel und auf Zugang zum Auslandshandel besteht nicht. 5. Weisungen zum Ausführungsplatz Die ING nimmt Aufträge zum Kauf oder Verkauf von Wertpapieren nur auf der Basis der Weisung eines Kunden, an welchem der unter 4. genannten Ausführungsplätze sein Auftrag ausgeführt werden soll, ent- gegen. Hinweis: An diese Weisung ist die ING gebunden. Der Kunde trägt daher das Risiko der Auswahl des geeigneten Ausführungsplatzes und die ING ist nicht verpflichtet, nach diesen Ausführungsgrundsätzen ein bestmögliches Ergebnis (Best Execution) zu erreichen. Der Kunde sollte sich daher vor seiner Entscheidung über die möglichen Ausführungs- plätze informieren (siehe Ziffer 4). Erteilt ein Kunde einen Auftrag ohne Weisung zu einem Ausführungsplatz, wird die ING die Ausführung des Auftrags ablehnen. Aufträge zum Kauf oder Verkauf von Fondsanteilen werden als Weisung zur Ausführung direkt über die Kapitalanlagegesellschaft behandelt, sofern der Kunde keine anderslautende Weisung erteilt. Für die Behand- lung von Bezugs rechten, die am letzten Tag des Bezugsrechtshandels zum Depotbestand des Kunden gehören, gilt Nr. 15 Abs. 1 der Verein- barungen zum Direkt-Depot entsprechend. 6. Zeichnung Diese Ausführungsgrundsätze gelten nur eingeschränkt, wenn die ING im Rahmen eines öffentlichen oder privaten Angebots Wertpapiere zur Zeichnung anbietet (insbesondere Aktien und Zertifikate). Eine bestmög- liche Ausführung im Sinne dieser Ausführungsgrundsätze erfolgt durch die Annahme des Zeichnungsantrags und einer möglichen Zuteilung oder Liefe rung der Wertpapiere durch die ING. 7. Überprüfung der Grundsätze Die Ausführungsgrundsätze werden durch die ING regelmäßig, mindes- tens einmal jährlich, überprüft. Eine Überprüfung findet ebenfalls statt, wenn eine wesentliche Veränderung des Marktumfelds eintritt, welche eine Anpassung der Ausführungsgrundsätze aufgrund einer Beein- trächtigung erforderlich machen kann. Gegebenenfalls vorgenommene wesentlichen Änderungen der Ausführungsgrundsätze werden regel- mäßig im Internet unter www.ing.de veröffentlicht. Daneben wird fortlaufend die Wirksamkeit der internen Vorkehrungen zur Einhaltung der Grundsätze, die Qualität der Ausführungen und die Eignung der ausgewählten Handels partner überprüft. Vereinbarungen zum Extra-Konto 1. Kontoinhaber Extra-Konten werden nur für natürliche Personen und auch nur für eigene Rechnung eröffnet und geführt. Neukunden müssen ihren Wohnsitz in Deutschland haben. (Hinweis: Die ING-DiBa AG, im Folgenden „ING“ genannt, eröffnet nur Extra-Konten für Personen, die im eigenen wirtschaftlichen Interesse und nicht auf fremde Veranlassung [insbeson- dere nicht als Treuhänder] handeln.) Bei mehr als einem Kontoinhaber zeichnet jeder einzeln und das Extra-Konto wird als Oder-Konto geführt. 2. Ziel der Auftragsausführung Kundenaufträge können regelmäßig über verschiedene Ausführungs- wege oder an verschiedenen Ausführungsplätzen ausgeführt werden, z. B. an Börsen oder an sonstigen Handelsplätzen, im Präsenzhandel einerseits, im elek tro nischen Handel andererseits. In den nachfolgenden Abschnitten werden die Ausführungswege und möglichen Ausführungs- plätze beschrieben, die im Regelfall gleichbleibend die bestmögliche Ausführung im Interesse des Kunden erwarten lassen und dem Kunden daher für den Wertpapierhandel zur Verfügung stehen. 3. Kriterien für die Auswahl der angebotenen Ausführungsplätze und Handelspartner Bei der Festlegung der dem Kunden zu seiner Auswahl angebotenen Ausführungsplätze geht die ING davon aus, dass der, unter Berücksichti- gung aller mit dem Ausführungsgeschäft verbundenen Kosten, best- mögliche Preis vorrangig ist. Dazu zählen insbesondere Wertpapierkurs, Courtage sowie Ausführungs-, Anbindungs- und Abwicklungskosten. Die ING wird ferner andere Ausführungsfaktoren und relevante Kriterien wie z. B. Marktmodell, Liquidität, Ausführungsgeschwindigkeit und -wahrscheinlichkeit, technische Infrastruktur, Regularien und Sicherheit der Abwicklung beachten. Für die Auswahl der Handelspartner gemäß Nr. 4 (2), an die Kunden- aufträge weitergeleitet werden, werden darüber hinaus als relevante Kriterien bestehende Börsenzugänge, der Zugang zu multilateralen Han- delssystemen oder der Zugang zu Liquiditätspools oder die Eigenschaft des Handelspartners als systematischer Internalisierer berücksichtigt. 4. Ausführungsplätze Damit die Auswahl des Ausführungsplatzes durch den Kunden auf informierter Basis erfolgen kann, stellt die ING auf ihrer Internetseite (www.ing.de) umfassende Informationen sowie eine detaillierte Dar- stellung der Gebühren zu den angebotenen Ausführungsplätzen und aktuelle Kursdaten zur Verfügung. Zudem werden auf der Internetseite (www.ing.de) weiterführende Infor- mationen zu den angebotenen Ausführungsplätzen und Handelspart- nern zur Verfügung gestellt, insbesondere eine nach Kategorien von Finanzinstru menten aufgeteilte Statistik über die fünf gemessen am Ordervolumen wichtigsten Ausführungsplätze und Handelspartner, über die die ING Kundenaufträge ausführt bzw. an die die ING Kundenauf- träge weiterleitet, und die dort erzielte Ausführungsqualität. (1) Inland und Fondsgesellschaft Den Kunden der ING stehen für Aufträge zum Kauf oder Verkauf von Wertpapieren im Inland in der Regel unter anderem alle deutschen Prä- senzbörsen, der elektronische Handel über Xetra, die Börse Frankfurt und Frankfurt Zertifikate sowie der Direkthandel über außerbörsliche Handelspartner, Gettex oder die Tradegate Exchange (gemäß den „Vereinbarungen für den Direkthandel“) zur Verfügung. Eine jeweils aktuelle Aufstellung kann unter www.ing.de eingesehen werden. Im Fall von Fonds, für die die ING eine Vertriebsvereinbarung geschlossen hat, ist zusätzlich der Handel über die Fondsgesellschaft möglich. Besonderheiten ergeben sich für offene Immobilienfonds. Der Kauf von Anteilen an offenen Immobilienfonds kann über die ING von der Fondsgesellschaft, an Börsen und im Direkthandel erfolgen. Die Rückgabe von Anteilen an offenen Immobilienfonds ist ausschließ- lich über die Börsen und den Direkthandel möglich. Ein Verkauf über die Fonds gesell schaft wird von der ING nicht angeboten. Ausgenommen hiervon sind Anteile, die ein Anleger vor dem 22.07.2013 erworben hat. Diese können bis zu einem Freibetrag von 30.000 Euro je Kalenderhalbjahr und je Immobilien Sondervermögen (WKN) über die Fondsgesellschaft zurückgegeben werden, sofern die ING eine Vertriebs- verein barung mit der Fondsgesellschaft geschlossen hat. Der Freibetrag je Anleger und je Immobilien-Sondervermögen gilt für alle auch bei anderen Instituten vor dem 22.07.2013 erworbenen Anteile des Anlegers. Die Inhaber eines Gemeinschaftsdepots gelten hinsichtlich des Frei- betrags ebenfalls als ein Anleger. Über diesen Freibetrag hinaus ist über die ING keine Rückgabe an die Fondsgesellschaft möglich. 12 7. Referenzkonto Als Referenzkonto für Auszahlungen und Lastschrifteinzug ist nur ein Girokonto zugelassen, welches auf den Namen des Extra-Konto Inhabers lautet. Der Konto inhaber kann das Referenzkonto durch Mitteilung an die ING einmal innerhalb von 30 Kalendertagen ändern. Änderungsauf- träge per Telefax sind nicht möglich. Verfügungen wird die ING dann nur noch zugunsten des neuen Referenzkontos vornehmen. Bei einem Gemeinschaftskonto (Oder-Konto) ist jeder Kontoinhaber allein berech- tigt, der ING ein neues Referenzkonto mitzuteilen. Änderungen des Referenzkontos (über Internetbanking) durch den Kontoinhaber können von der ING gestattet werden. 8. Vereinbarungen für Gemeinschaftskonten mit Einzelverfügungs berechtigung für jeden Konto- inhaber (Oder-Konten) Jeder Kontoinhaber kann über das Extra-Konto ohne Zustimmung des anderen Kontoinhabers verfügen und zulasten des Kontos alle mit der Konto führung im Zusammenhang stehenden Vereinbarungen treffen. Darüber hinaus kann jeder Kontoinhaber interne Umbuchungen auf Konten veranlassen, die auf den Namen beider Kontoinhaber geführt werden, oder auf eigene Einzelkonten, über die der andere Kontoinhaber verfügungsberechtigt ist. 9. Widerruf der Einzelverfügungsberechtigung Jeder Kontoinhaber kann die Einzelverfügungsberechtigung eines ande- ren Kontoinhabers jederzeit mit Wirkung für die Zukunft der ING gegen- über widerrufen. Über den Widerruf ist die ING unverzüglich zu unter- richten. Der Widerruf führt zu einem Abweichen von der vereinbarten Form der Kontoführung (Ziffer 1), weil sichergestellt werden muss, dass Verfügungen über das Extra-Konto nur von allen Kontoinhabern gemeinsam erfolgen dürfen. Ab Eingang der Widerrufserklärung bei der ING ist eine Teilnahme am Telebanking sowie am Internetbanking für keinen der Kontoinhaber mehr möglich. 10. Verpfändung Guthaben auf Extra-Konten können nicht verpfändet werden. 11. Regelung für den Todesfall eines Kontoinhabers Nach dem Tode eines Kontoinhabers bleiben die Befugnisse des anderen Kontoinhabers unverändert bestehen. Jedoch kann der überlebende Kontoinhaber ohne Mitwirkung der Erben die Konten auflösen. Die Rechte des Verstorbenen werden durch seine Erben gemeinschaftlich wahr- genommen. Das Recht zum Widerruf der Einzelverfügungsberechtigung steht jedoch jedem Erben allein zu. Widerruft ein Miterbe, bedarf jede Verfügung über das Konto seiner Mitwirkung. Widerrufen sämtliche Mit- erben die Einzelverfügungsberechtigung eines Kontoinhabers, so können sämtliche Kontoinhaber nur noch gemeinschaftlich mit sämtlichen Mit erben über das Konto verfügen. 12. Postanschrift Als Postanschrift gilt die Anschrift des ersten Kontoinhabers (gemäß Extra-Kontovertrag). Der Kontoinhaber ist verpflichtet, jede Änderung der Postanschrift unverzüglich mitzuteilen. 13. Laufzeit/Kündigung Der Extra-Konto Vertrag unterliegt keiner Mindestlaufzeit. Der Konto- inhaber kann den Extra-Konto Vertrag jederzeit ohne Einhaltung einer Frist kündigen. Die ING kann den Extra-Konto Vertrag jederzeit unter Einhaltung einer angemessenen Frist kündigen. Bei der Bemessung der Kündigungsfrist wird die ING auf die berechtigten Belange des Konto- inhabers Rücksicht nehmen. Die Kündigungsfrist beträgt mindestens 2 Monate. Das Recht zur fristlosen Kündigung aus wichtigem Grund bleibt bestehen. 2. Wesentliche Leistungsmerkmale/Kontoführung/ Rechnungsabschluss (1) Wesentliche Leistungsmerkmale Das Extra-Konto dient der Geldanlage. Das auf dem Extra-Konto verwahrte Guthaben ist täglich ohne Kündigungsfrist fällig. Der Kontovertrag umfasst die Verwahrung der Einlagen, Kontoführung, Einzahlungen, Überweisungen auf das Referenzkonto und den Lastschrifteinzug vom Referenzkonto. Das Extra-Konto dient nicht der Abwicklung von Zahlungs- verkehrsvorgängen und nimmt nicht am Auslandszahlungsverkehr teil. Die ING wird auf das Extra-Konto gezogene Lastschriften nicht einlösen. (2) Kontoführung Das Extra-Konto wird per Internetbanking inklusive Post-Box geführt. Verfügungen und Weisungen können per Internetbanking erteilt werden. Rechnungsabschlüsse und Mitteilungen werden elektronisch in die Inter- netbanking Post-Box eingestellt. (3) Rechnungsabschluss Von der ING erhält der Kontoinhaber jeweils zum Ende eines Kalender- jahres einen Rechnungsabschluss. Einwendungen wegen Unrichtigkeit oder Unvollständigkeit eines Rechnungsabschlusses hat der Konto- inhaber spätestens vor Ablauf von 6 Wochen nach dessen Zugang zu erheben; macht er seine Einwendungen in Textform geltend, genügt die Absendung innerhalb der 6-Wochen-Frist. Das Unterlassen rechtzei- tiger Einwendungen gilt als Genehmigung. Auf diese Folge wird die ING bei Erteilung des Rechnungsabschlusses besonders hinweisen. Der Konto inhaber kann auch nach Fristablauf eine Berichtigung des Rech- nungsabschlusses verlangen, muss dann aber beweisen, dass das Konto zu Unrecht belastet oder eine Gutschrift nicht erteilt wurde. 3. Entgelte und Aufwendungsersatz Entgelte für die im Rahmen des Extra-Konto Vertrags erbrachten Leis- tungen ergeben sich aus den mit dem Kontoinhaber getroffenen Verein- barungen (z. B. Vereinbarung zum Verwahrentgelt). Es gilt das Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis. Ein möglicher Anspruch der ING auf Ersatz von Aufwendungen richtet sich nach den gesetzlichen Vorschriften. 4. Guthabenzins Die Zinsen werden jährlich zum 31.12. taggenau berechnet und dem Extra-Konto gutgeschrieben, diese sind dem jährlichen Kontoauszug zu entnehmen. Die ING ist berechtigt, den Zinssatz nach billigem Ermessen (§ 315 BGB) zu ändern. Der Kontoinhaber kann den aktuellen Zinssatz jederzeit unter www.ing.de/konditionen abfragen. 5. Steuern, Mitteilung von Änderungen Einkünfte sind steuerpflichtig. Sofern der Kontoinhaber keinen Freistel- lungsauftrag erteilt hat oder der Sparer-Pauschbetrag ausgeschöpft ist, führt die ING die Kapitalertragsteuer für ihn ab. Bei Fragen sollte sich der Kontoinhaber an die für ihn zuständige Steuerbehörde bzw. seinen steuerlichen Berater wenden. Dies gilt insbesondere, wenn er im Aus- land steuerpflichtig ist. Der Kontoinhaber ist verpflichtet, der ING eine Änderung seiner zur Steuerpflicht im Ausland gemachten Angaben unverzüglich mitzuteilen. 6. Einzahlungen, Verfügungen Bei Verfügungen über das Gesamtguthaben bleibt das Extra-Konto wei- terhin bestehen, es sei denn, der Kontoinhaber wünscht ausdrücklich eine Kontoauflösung. Einzahlungen auf Extra-Konten sind durch Über- weisung und durch Bareinzahlungen bei fremden Kreditinstituten möglich und soweit angeboten durch regelmäßige Lastschrifteinzüge (Sparpläne), dann nur in einem Abstand von 30 Kalendertagen möglich. Prämienbegünstigte vermögenswirksame Leistungen im Sinne des Vermögensbildungsgesetzes können nicht auf das Extra-Konto einge- zahlt werden. Die ING behält sich vor, als vermögenswirksame Leistung gekennzeichnete Zahlungseingänge zurückzuweisen. Die Übermittlung von Aufträgen per Telefax ist nicht möglich. Die ING kann die Höhe des maximalen Lastschriftbetrags festlegen. Auftrage zum Lastschrifteinzug von anderen Konten sind nicht möglich. 13 Nicht geschützt werden insbesondere Einlagen von finanziellen Unter- nehmen, staatlichen Stellen einschließlich kommunaler Gebietskörper- schaften, Einlagen, die im Zusammenhang mit Geldwäsche oder Terro- rismusfinanzierung entstanden sind, und Inhaberschuldverschreibungen. Im Fall von Gläubigern nach Buchstaben (b)(ii), (c)(ii) und (d)(ii) werden Einlagen mit einer Laufzeit von mehr als 12 Monaten sowie Verbindlich- keiten aus Schuldscheindarlehen, Namenschuldverschreibungen und vergleichbaren Schuldtiteln ausländischen Rechts nicht geschützt. Für Verbindlichkeiten von Banken, die bis zum Ablauf des 31. Dezember 2022 gemäß § 6 der am 18. November 2021 im Vereinsregister einge- tragenen Fassung des Statuts des Einlagensicherungsfonds gesichert wurden, besteht die Sicherung nach Maßgabe dieser Vorschrift fort. Nach dem 31. Dezember 2022 entfällt dieser Bestandsschutz, sobald die betreffende Verbindlichkeit fällig wird, gekündigt oder anderweitig zurückgefordert werden kann, oder wenn die Verbindlichkeit im Wege einer Einzel- oder Gesamtrechtsnachfolge übergeht oder auf eine ausländische Zweigniederlassung oder Zweigstelle übertragen wird. Einzelheiten zum Schutzumfang einschließlich der Sicherungsgrenzen sind im Statut des Einlagensicherungsfonds, insbesondere dessen § 6 geregelt. Das Statut wird auf Verlangen zur Verfügung gestellt und kann auch im Internet unter www.bankenverband.de aufgerufen werden. Forderungsübergang und Auskunftserteilung (4) Forderungsübergang Soweit der Einlagensicherungsfonds oder ein von ihm Beauftragter Zahlungen an einen Kunden leistet, gehen dessen Forderungen gegen die ING in entsprechender Höhe mit allen Nebenrechten Zug um Zug auf den Einlagensicherungsfonds über. (5) Auskunftserteilung Die ING ist befugt, dem Einlagensicherungsfonds oder einem von ihnen Beauftragten alle in diesem Zusammenhang erforderlichen Auskünfte zu erteilen und Unterlagen zur Verfügung zu stellen. 15. Pfandrecht Der Kontoinhaber und die ING sind sich darüber einig, dass der ING ein Pfand recht an dem Guthaben einschließlich aller Zinsen auf dem Extra- Konto zusteht. Das Pfandrecht dient der Sicherung aller bestehenden, künftigen und bedingten Ansprüche, die der ING mit sämtlichen ihrer in- und ausländischen Geschäftsstellen aus der bankmäßigen Geschäfts- beziehung gegen den Kontoinhaber zustehen. 16. Beschwerde- und Alternative Streitbeilegungs- verfahren Der Kunde hat folgende außergerichtliche Möglichkeiten: • Der Kunde kann sich mit einer Beschwerde an die Kontaktstelle der ING wenden: ING-DiBa AG, 60628 Frankfurt am Main oder unter: https://www.ing.de/kundenservice. • Die ING wird Beschwerden in geeigneter Weise beantworten, bei Zah- lungsdiensteverträgen erfolgt dies in Textform (zum Beispiel mittels Brief, Telefax oder E-Mail). • Die ING nimmt am Streitbeilegungsverfahren der Verbraucherschlich- tungsstelle Ombudsmann der privaten Banken“ (www.bankenombudsmann.de) teil.

Information über die Einlagensicherung (1) Einlagen Einlagen sind Guthaben, die sich im Rahmen von Bankgeschäften aus Beträgen, die auf einem Konto verblieben sind, oder aus Zwischenposi- tionen ergeben und die nach den geltenden gesetzlichen und vertrag- lichen Bedingungen von der ING zurückzuzahlen sind, wie zum Beispiel Guthaben auf Girokonten, Festgelder, Spareinlagen, Sparbriefe und Namensschuldverschreibungen. Maßgeblich sind die Definitionen in § 2 Absatz 3 des Einlagensicherungsgesetzes (EinSiG) bzw. § 6 Absatz 1 des Statuts des innerhalb des Bundesverbandes deutscher Banken e.V. bestehenden Einlagensicherungsfonds deutscher Banken (Einlagen- sicherungsfonds). (2) Gesetzliche Einlagensicherung Die ING ist der Entschädigungseinrichtung deutscher Banken GmbH als Träger der gesetzliche Einlagensicherung der privaten Banken zugeordnet. Die gesetzliche Einlagensicherung schützt nach Maßgabe des EinSiG und vorbehaltlich der darin vorgesehenen Ausnahmen Einlagen bis zu einem Gegenwert von 100.000 € pro Einleger. In den in § 8 Absatz 2 EinSiG genannten Fällen erhöht sich dieser Betrag auf 500.000 €. Dazu gehören insbesondere Beträge, die aus Immobilientransaktionen im Zusammen- hang mit privat genutzten Wohnimmobilien resultieren. Nicht geschützt werden insbesondere Einlagen von finanziellen Unternehmen, staatli- chen Stellen einschließlich kommunaler Gebietskörperschaften, Einlagen, die im Zusammenhang mit Geldwäsche oder Terrorismusfinanzierung entstanden sind, und Inhaberschuldverschreibungen. Einzelheiten sind im EinSiG, insbesondere dessen § 8 geregelt. (3) Einlagensicherungsfonds Die ING wirkt außerdem am Einlagensicherungsfonds mit. Dieser sichert nach Maßgabe seines Statuts und vorbehaltlich der darin vorgesehenen Ausnahmen Einlagen bei einer inländischen Haupt- oder Zweignieder- lassung bzw. Zweigstelle je Gläubiger maximal bis zur folgenden Höhe (Sicherungsgrenze): (a) (i) 5 Mio. € für natürliche Personen und rechtsfähige Stiftungen unabhängig von ihrer Laufzeit und (ii) 50 Mio. € für nichtfinanzielle Unternehmen, gemeinnützige Orga- nisationen, Verbände und Berufsorganisationen ohne Erwerbs- zweck und anderer in § 6 Absatz 3 des Statuts des Einlagensiche- rungsfonds genannter Gläubiger. In jedem Fall werden Einlagen bis maximal 15 % der Eigenmittel der Bank im Sinne von Artikel 72 CRR geschützt, wobei Ergänzungskapital nur bis zur Höhe von 25 % des Kernkapitals im Sinne von Artikel 25 CRR Berücksichtigung findet. Weitere Einzelheiten zur Berechnung der relevanten Eigenmittel regelt § 6 Absatz 8 Unterabsatz (a) des Statuts des Einlagensicherungsfonds. (b) Ab dem 1. Januar 2025: (i) 3 Mio. € für natürliche Personen und rechtsfähige Stiftungen unabhängig von ihrer Laufzeit und (ii) 30 Mio. € für nichtfinanzielle Unternehmen, gemeinnützige Orga- nisationen, Verbände und Berufsorganisationen ohne Erwerbs- zweck und anderer in § 6 Absatz 3 des Statuts des Einlagensiche- rungsfonds genannter Gläubiger.

Dezember 2022 gesichert wurden, finden die zu diesem Zeitpunkt geltenden Sicherungsgrenzen weiterhin Anwendung bis die Einlage fällig ist, prolongiert wird oder vom Kunden erstmals gekündigt werden kann oder auf eine aus- ländische Zweigniederlassung oder Zweigstellen übertragen wird. Für Einlagen, die nach dem 31. Dezember 2022 begründet oder prolongiert werden, gelten die jeweils neuen Sicherungsgrenzen ab den oben genannten Stichtagen. Maßgebend für die Entschädigung ist die Sicherungsgrenze, die der ING als Ergebnis der Feststellung des Prüfungsverbandes mitgeteilt worden ist und im Internet unter www.bankenverband.de abgerufen werden kann. Die Sicherungsgrenze wird dem Kunden von der ING auf Verlangen bekannt gegeben. 14 19.

In diesen Fällen wird die ING die Zustimmung des Kunden zu den Ände- rungen auf andere Weise einholen. (2.5) Kündigungsrecht des Kunden bei der Zustimmungsfiktion Macht die ING von der Zustimmungsfiktion Gebrauch, kann der Kunde den von der Änderung betroffenen Vertrag vor dem vorgeschlagenen Zeitpunkt des Wirksamwerdens der Änderungen auch fristlos und kosten- frei kündigen. Auf dieses Kündigungsrecht wird die ING den Kunden in ihrem Änderungsangebot besonders hinweisen. 2. Bankgeheimnis und Bankauskunft (1) Bankgeheimnis Die ING ist zur Verschwiegenheit über alle kundenbezogenen Tatsachen und Wertungen verpflichtet, von denen sie Kenntnis erlangt (Bankge- heimnis). Informationen über den Kunden darf die ING nur weitergeben, wenn gesetzliche Bestimmungen dies gebieten oder der Kunde einge- willigt hat oder die ING zur Erteilung einer Bankauskunft befugt ist. (2) Bankauskunft Eine Bankauskunft enthält allgemein gehaltene Feststellungen und Bemerkungen über die wirtschaftlichen Verhältnisse des Kunden, seine Kreditwürdigkeit und Zahlungsfähigkeit; betragsmäßige Angaben über Kontostände, Sparguthaben, Depot- oder sonstige der ING anvertraute Vermögenswerte sowie Angaben über die Höhe von Kredit- inanspruchnahmen werden nicht gemacht. (3) Voraussetzungen für die Erteilung einer Bankauskunft Die ING ist befugt, über juristische Personen und im Handelsregister ein- getragene Kaufleute Bankauskünfte zu erteilen, sofern sich die Anfrage auf ihre geschäftliche Tätigkeit bezieht. Die ING erteilt jedoch keine Auskünfte, wenn ihr eine anderslautende Weisung des Kunden vorliegt. Bankauskünfte über andere Personen, insbesondere über Privatkunden und Vereinigungen, erteilt die ING nur dann, wenn diese generell oder im Einzelfall ausdrücklich zugestimmt haben. Eine Bankauskunft wird nur erteilt, wenn der Anfragende ein berechtigtes Interesse an der Allgemeine Geschäfts- bedingungen 1. Geltungsbereich und Änderungen dieser Geschäftsbedingungen und der Sonder- bedingungen für einzelne Geschäftsbeziehungen (1) Geltungsbereich Die Allgemeinen Geschäftsbedingungen gelten für die gesamte Geschäfts- verbindung zwischen dem Kunden und den inländischen Geschäfts- stellen der ING-DiBa AG (im Folgenden ING genannt). Daneben gelten für einzelne Geschäftsbeziehungen (z. B. für das Wertpapiergeschäft, für den kartengestützten Zahlungsverkehr, für den Scheckverkehr, für den Sparver kehr, für den Überweisungsverkehr) Sonderbedingungen, die Abweichungen oder Ergänzungen zu diesen Allgemeinen Geschäftsbe- dingungen enthalten; sie werden bei der Kontoeröffnung oder bei Ertei- lung eines Auftrags mit dem Kunden vereinbart. Unterhält der Kunde auch Geschäftsverbindungen zu ausländischen Geschäftsstellen, sichert das Pfandrecht der ING (Nr. 14 dieser Geschäftsbedingungen) auch die Ansprüche dieser ausländischen Geschäftsstellen. (2) Änderungen (2.1) Änderungsangebot Änderungen dieser Geschäftsbedingungen und der Sonderbedingungen werden dem Kunden spätestens zwei Monate vor dem vorgeschlagenen Zeitpunkt ihres Wirksamwerdens in Textform angeboten. Hat der Kunde mit der ING im Rahmen der Geschäftsbeziehung einen elektronischen Kommunikationsweg vereinbart (zum Beispiel das Internetbanking), können die Änderungen auch auf diesem Wege angeboten werden. (2.2) Annahme durch den Kunden Die von der ING angebotenen Änderungen werden nur wirksam, wenn der Kunde diese annimmt, gegebenenfalls im Wege der nachfolgend geregelten Zustimmungsfiktion. (2.3) Annahme durch den Kunden im Wege der Zustimmungsfiktion Das Schweigen des Kunden gilt nur dann als Annahme des Änderungs- angebots (Zustimmungsfiktion), wenn (a) das Änderungsangebot der ING erfolgt, um die Übereinstimmung der vertraglichen Bestimmungen mit einer veränderten Rechts- lage wieder herzustellen, weil eine Bestimmung dieser Geschäfts- bedingungen oder der Sonderbedingungen - aufgrund einer Änderung von Gesetzen, einschließlich unmittel- bar geltender Rechtsvorschriften der Europäischen Union, nicht mehr der Rechtslage entspricht oder - durch eine rechtskräftige gerichtliche Entscheidung, auch durch ein Gericht erster Instanz, unwirksam wird oder nicht mehr ver- wendet werden darf oder - aufgrund einer verbindlichen Verfügung einer für die ING zustän- digen nationalen oder internationalen Behörde (z. B. der Bundes- anstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht oder der Europäischen Zentralbank) nicht mehr mit den aufsichtsrechtlichen Verpflich- tungen der ING in Einklang zu bringen ist, und Abschnitt 3 Widerrufsfolgen Im Fall eines wirksamen Widerrufs sind die beiderseits empfangenen Leistungen zurückzugewähren. Sie sind zur Zahlung von Wertersatz für die bis zum Widerruf erbrachte Dienstleistung verpflichtet, wenn Sie vor Abgabe Ihrer Vertragserklärung auf diese Rechtsfolge hingewiesen wurden und ausdrücklich zugestimmt haben, dass vor dem Ende der Widerrufsfrist mit der Ausführung der Gegenleistung begonnen werden kann. Besteht eine Verpflichtung zur Zahlung von Wertersatz, kann dies dazu führen, dass Sie die vertraglichen Zahlungsverpflichtungen für den Zeitraum bis zum Widerruf dennoch erfüllen müssen. Ihr Widerrufsrecht erlischt vorzeitig, wenn der Vertrag von beiden Seiten auf Ihren ausdrücklichen Wunsch vollständig erfüllt ist, bevor Sie Ihr Widerrufsrecht ausgeübt haben. Verpflichtungen zur Erstattung von Zahlungen müssen innerhalb von 30 Tagen erfüllt werden. Diese Frist beginnt für Sie mit der Absendung Ihrer Widerrufserklärung, für uns mit deren Empfang. Besondere Hinweise Bei Widerruf dieses Vertrags sind Sie auch an einen mit diesem Vertrag zusammenhängenden Vertrag nicht mehr gebunden, wenn der zusammen- hängende Vertrag eine Leistung betrifft, die von uns oder einem Dritten auf der Grundlage einer Vereinbarung zwischen uns und dem Dritten erbracht wird. Ende der Widerrufsbelehrung 16 oder bei einem anderen zuständigen Gericht verklagen; dasselbe gilt für eine juristische Person des öffentlichen Rechts und für öffentlich-recht- liche Sondervermögen. Die ING selbst kann von diesen Kunden nur an dem für die konto führende Stelle zuständigen Gericht verklagt werden. (3) Gerichtsstand für Auslandskunden Die Gerichtsstandsvereinbarung gilt auch für Kunden, die im Ausland eine vergleichbare gewerbliche Tätigkeit ausüben, sowie für ausländische Institutionen, die mit inländischen juristischen Personen des öffentlichen Rechts oder mit einem inländischen öffentlich-rechtlichen Sonder- vermögen vergleichbar sind. 7. Rechnungsabschlüsse bei Kontokorrentkonten (Konten in laufender Rechnung); Genehmigung von Belastungen aus Lastschriften (1) Erteilung der Rechnungsabschlüsse Die ING erteilt bei einem Kontokorrentkonto, sofern nicht etwas anderes vereinbart ist, jeweils zum Ende eines Kalenderquartals einen Rech- nungsabschluss; dabei werden die in diesem Zeitraum entstandenen beiderseitigen Ansprüche (einschließlich der Zinsen und Entgelte der ING) verrechnet. Die ING kann auf den Saldo, der sich aus Verrechnung ergibt, nach Nr. 12 dieser Geschäftsbedingungen oder nach der mit dem Kunden anderweitig getroffenen Vereinbarung Zinsen berechnen. (2) Frist für Einwendungen; Genehmigung durch Schweigen Einwendungen wegen Unrichtigkeit oder Unvollständigkeit eines Rech- nungsabschlusses hat der Kunde spätestens vor Ablauf von 6 Wochen nach dessen Zugang zu erheben; macht er seine Einwendungen in Text- form geltend, genügt die Absendung innerhalb der 6-Wochen-Frist. Das Unterlassen rechtzeitiger Einwendungen gilt als Genehmigung. Auf diese Folge wird die ING bei Erteilung des Rechnungsabschlusses beson- ders hinweisen. Der Kunde kann auch nach Fristablauf eine Berichtigung des Rechnungsabschlusses verlangen, muss dann aber beweisen, dass sein Konto zu Unrecht belastet oder eine ihm zustehende Gutschrift nicht erteilt wurde. 8. Storno- und Berichtigungsbuchungen der ING (1) Vor Rechnungsabschluss Fehlerhafte Gutschriften auf Kontokorrentkonten (z. B. wegen einer falschen Kontonummer) darf die ING bis zum nächsten Rechnungsab- schluss durch eine Belastungsbuchung rückgängig machen, soweit ihr ein Rückzahlungsanspruch gegen den Kunden zusteht (Stornobuchung); der Kunde kann in diesem Fall gegen die Belastungsbuchung nicht einwenden, dass er in Höhe der Gutschrift bereits verfügt hat. (2) Nach Rechnungsabschluss Stellt die ING eine fehlerhafte Gutschrift erst nach einem Rechnungs- abschluss fest und steht ihr ein Rückzahlungsanspruch gegen den Kunden zu, so wird sie in Höhe ihres Anspruchs sein Konto belasten (Berich tigungsbuchung). Erhebt der Kunde gegen die Berichtigungs- buchung Einwendungen, so wird die ING den Betrag dem Konto wieder gutschreiben und ihren Rückzahlungsanspruch gesondert geltend machen. (3) Information des Kunden; Zinsberechnung Über Storno- und Berichtigungsbuchungen wird die ING den Kunden unverzüglich unterrichten. Die Buchungen nimmt die ING hinsichtlich der Zinsberechnung rückwirkend zu dem Tag vor, an dem die fehler- hafte Buchung durchgeführt wurde. 9. Einzugsaufträge (1) Erteilung von Vorbehaltsgutschriften bei der Einreichung Schreibt die ING den Gegenwert von Schecks und Lastschriften schon vor ihrer Einlösung gut, geschieht dies unter dem Vorbehalt ihrer Ein- lösung, und zwar auch dann, wenn diese Papiere bei der ING selbst zahl- bar sind. Reicht der Kunde andere Papiere mit dem Auftrag ein, von einem Zahlungspflichtigen einen Forderungsbetrag zu beschaffen (z. B. Zinsscheine), und erteilt die ING über den Betrag eine Gutschrift, so steht diese unter dem Vorbehalt, dass die ING den Betrag erhält. Der Vor- behalt gilt auch dann, wenn die Papiere bei der ING selbst zahlbar sind. Werden Schecks oder Lastschriften nicht eingelöst oder erhält die ING den Betrag aus dem Einzugsauftrag nicht, macht die ING die Vorbehalts- gewünschten Auskunft glaubhaft dargelegt hat und kein Grund zu der Annahme besteht, dass schutzwürdige Belange des Kunden der Auskunftserteilung entgegenstehen. (4) Empfänger von Bankauskünften Bankauskünfte erteilt die ING nur eigenen Kunden sowie anderen Kredit- instituten für deren Zwecke oder die ihrer Kunden. 3. Haftung der ING; Mitverschulden des Kunden (1) Haftungsgrundsätze Die ING haftet bei der Erfüllung ihrer Verpflichtungen für jedes Verschul- den ihrer Mitarbeiter und der Personen, die sie zur Erfüllung ihrer Verpflichtungen hinzuzieht. Soweit die Sonderbedingungen für einzelne Geschäfts beziehun gen oder sonstige Vereinbarungen etwas Abwei- chendes regeln, gehen diese Regelungen vor. Hat der Kunde durch ein schuldhaftes Verhalten (z. B. durch Verletzung der in Nr. 11 dieser Geschäftsbedingungen aufgeführten Mitwir kungspflichten) zu der Ent- stehung eines Schadens bei getragen, bestimmt sich nach den Grund- sätzen des Mitverschuldens, in welchem Umfang die ING und der Kunde den Schaden zu tragen haben. (2) Weitergeleitete Aufträge Wenn ein Auftrag seinem Inhalt nach typischerweise in der Form ausge- führt wird, dass die ING einen Dritten mit der weiteren Erledigung betraut, erfüllt die ING den Auftrag dadurch, dass sie ihn im eigenen Namen an den Dritten weiterleitet (weitergeleiteter Auftrag). Dies betrifft z. B. die Ein ho lung von Bankauskünften bei anderen Kreditinstitu- ten oder die Verwahrung und Verwaltung von Wertpapieren im Ausland. In diesen Fällen beschränkt sich die Haftung der ING auf die sorgfältige Auswahl und Unterweisung des Dritten. (3) Störung des Betriebs Die ING haftet nicht für Schäden, die durch höhere Gewalt, Aufruhr, Kriegs- und Naturereignisse oder durch sonstige von ihr nicht zu ver tretende Vorkommnisse (z. B. Streik, Aussperrung, Verkehrsstörung, Ver fügungen von hoher Hand im In- und Ausland) eintreten. 4. Grenzen der Aufrechnungsbefugnis des Kunden, der kein Verbraucher ist Ein Kunde, der kein Verbraucher ist, kann gegen Forderungen der ING nur aufrechnen, wenn seine Forderungen unbestritten oder rechts- kräftig festgestellt sind. Diese Aufrechnungsbeschränkung gilt nicht für eine vom Kunden zur Aufrechnung gestellte Forderung, die ihren Rechts- grund in einem Darlehen oder einer Finanzierungshilfe gemäß §§ 513, 491 bis 512 BGB hat. 5. Verfügungsberechtigung nach dem Tod des Kunden Nach dem Tod des Kunden hat derjenige, der sich gegenüber der ING auf die Rechtsnachfolge des Kunden beruft, der ING seine erbrechtliche Berechtigung in geeigneter Weise nachzuweisen. Wird der ING eine Ausfertigung oder eine beglaubigte Abschrift der letztwilligen Verfügung (Testament, Erbvertrag) nebst zugehöriger Eröffnungsniederschrift vorgelegt, darf die ING denjenigen, der darin als Erbe oder Testaments- vollstrecker bezeichnet ist, als Berechtigten ansehen, ihn verfügen lassen und insbesondere mit befreiender Wirkung an ihn leisten. Dies gilt nicht, wenn der ING bekannt ist, dass der dort Genannte (zum Beispiel nach Anfechtung oder wegen Nichtigkeit des Testaments) nicht verfügungsberechtigt ist, oder wenn ihr dies infolge Fahrlässigkeit nicht bekannt geworden ist. 6. Maßgebliches Recht und Gerichtsstand bei kauf- männischen und öffentlich-rechtlichen Kunden (1) Geltung deutschen Rechts Für die Geschäftsverbindungen zwischen dem Kunden und der ING gilt deutsches Recht. (2) Gerichtsstand für Inlandskunden Ist der Kunde ein Kaufmann und ist die streitige Geschäftsbeziehung dem Betrieb seines Handelsgewerbes zuzurechnen, so kann die ING die- sen Kunden an dem für die kontoführende Stelle zuständigen Gericht 17 (3) Besonderer Hinweis bei Eilbedürftigkeit der Ausführung einesAuftrags Hält der Kunde bei der Ausführung eines Auftrags besondere Eile für nötig, hat er dies der ING gesondert mitzuteilen. Bei formularmäßig erteilten Aufträgen muss dies außerhalb des Formulars erfolgen. (4) Prüfung und Einwendungen bei Mitteilungen der ING Der Kunde hat Kontoauszüge, Wertpapierabrechnungen, Depot- und Erträgnisaufstellungen, sonstige Abrechnungen, Anzeigen über die Aus- führung von Aufträgen und Überweisungen sowie Informationen über erwartete Zahlungen und Sendungen (Avise) auf ihre Richtigkeit und Vollständigkeit unverzüglich zu überprüfen und etwaige Einwendungen unverzüglich zu erheben. (5) Benachrichtigung der ING bei Ausbleiben von Mitteilungen Falls Rechnungsabschlüsse und Depotaufstellungen dem Kunden nicht zu gehen, muss er die ING unverzüglich benachrichtigen. Die Benach- richtigungspflicht besteht auch beim Ausbleiben anderer Mitteilungen, deren Eingang der Kunde erwartet (Wertpapierabrechnungen, Konto- auszüge nach der Ausführung von Aufträgen des Kunden oder über Zahlungen, die der Kunde erwartet). (6) Weitere Mitteilungspflichten Die ING stellt gemäß den Anforderungen aus dem Geldwäschegesetz sicher, dass Dokumente, Daten und Informationen über Kunden und wirtschaftlich Berechtigte, über deren Geschäftstätigkeit und – soweit erforderlich – über die Herkunft der Vermögenswerte (nachfolgend „Kundendaten“) in angemessenen zeitlichen Abständen aktualisiert werden. Informationen zur Herkunft der Vermögenswerte umfassen auch Angaben zum Beschäftigungsstatus (z.B. angestellt, selbstständig, in Rente) und zur Branche, in der die berufliche Tätigkeit ausgeübt wird (z.B. Handel, Baugewerbe, öffentlicher Dienst). Um die Kundendaten aktuell halten zu können, erteilt der Kunde – nach ausdrücklicher Aufforderung der ING – zum Zwecke der Geldwäsche- prävention Auskunft darüber, ob und ggf. wie sich die vorhandenen Kunden daten geändert haben. Die ING ist berechtigt, vom Kunden geeignete Nachweise anzufordern. Zusätzlich zu den Mitteilungspflichten gemäß Absatz 1 hat der Kunde der ING jede Änderung seiner Staatsangehörigkeit, seiner Telefon- nummer sowie seiner E-Mail-Adresse unverzüglich mitzuteilen. 12. Zinsen, Entgelte und Aufwendungen (1) Zinsen und Entgelte im Geschäft mit Verbrauchern Die Höhe der Zinsen und Entgelte für die üblichen Bankleistungen, die die ING gegenüber Verbrauchern erbringt, einschließlich der Höhe von Zahlungen, die über die für die Hauptleistung vereinbarten Entgelte hinausgehen, ergeben sich aus dem „Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis“. Wenn ein Verbraucher eine dort aufgeführte Hauptleistung in Anspruch nimmt und dabei keine abweichende Vereinbarung getroffen wurde, gelten die zu diesem Zeitpunkt im Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis ange- gebenen Zinsen und Entgelte. Eine Vereinbarung, die auf eine über das vereinbarte Entgelt für die Hauptleistung hinausgehende Zahlung des Verbrauchers gerichtet ist, kann die ING mit dem Verbraucher nur aus- drücklich treffen, wenn sie im Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis ausgewie- sen ist. Für die Vergütung der nicht im Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis aufgeführten Leistungen, die im Auftrag des Verbrauchers erbracht werden und die, nach den Umständen zu urteilen, nur gegen eine Vergü- tung zu erwarten sind, gelten, soweit keine andere Vereinbarung getroffen wurde, die gesetzlichen Vorschriften. (2) Zinsen und Entgelte im Geschäft mit Kunden, die keine Verbraucher sind Die Höhe der Zinsen und Entgelte für die üblichen Bankleistungen, die die ING gegenüber Kunden, die keine Verbraucher sind, erbringt, ergeben sich aus dem „Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis“, soweit das Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis übliche Bankleistungen gegenüber Kunden, die keine Verbraucher sind (z. B. Geschäftskunden), ausweisen. Wenn ein Kunde, der kein Verbraucher ist, eine dort aufgeführte Bankleistung in Anspruch nimmt und dabei keine abweichende Vereinbarung getrof- fen wurde, gelten die zu diesem Zeitpunkt im Preis- und Leistungs- verzeichnis angegebenen Zinsen und Entgelte. gutschrift rückgängig. Dies geschieht unabhängig davon, ob in der Zwischen zeit ein Rechnungsabschluss erteilt wurde. (2) Einlösung von Lastschriften und vom Kunden ausgestellten Schecks Lastschriften sowie Schecks sind eingelöst, wenn die Belastungsbuchung nicht spätestens am zweiten Geschäftstag nach ihrer Vornahme rück- gängig gemacht wird. Barschecks sind bereits mit Zahlung an den Scheckvorleger eingelöst. Schecks sind auch schon dann eingelöst, wenn die ING im Einzelfall eine Bezahltmeldung absendet. Schecks, die über die Abrechnungsstelle der Bundesbank vorgelegt werden, sind eingelöst, wenn sie nicht bis zu dem von der Bundesbank festgesetzten Zeitpunkt zurück ge geben werden. 10. Fremdwährungsgeschäfte und Risiken bei Fremdwährungskonten (1) Auftragsausführung bei Fremdwährungskonten Fremdwährungskonten des Kunden dienen dazu, Zahlungen an den Kunden und Verfügungen des Kunden in fremder Währung bargeldlos abzuwickeln. Verfügungen über Guthaben auf Fremdwährungskonten (z. B. durch Überweisungen zulasten des Fremdwährungsguthabens) werden unter Einschaltung von Banken im Heimatland der Währung abgewickelt, wenn sie die ING nicht vollständig innerhalb des eigenen Hauses ausführt. (2) Gutschriften bei Fremdwährungsgeschäften mit dem Kunden Schließt die ING mit dem Kunden ein Geschäft (z. B. ein Devisentermin- geschäft) ab, aus dem sie die Verschaffung eines Betrags in fremder Währung schuldet, wird sie ihre Fremdwährungsverbindlichkeit durch Gutschrift auf dem Konto des Kunden in dieser Währung erfüllen, sofern nicht etwas anderes vereinbart ist. (3) Vorübergehende Beschränkung der Leistung durch die ING Die Verpflichtung der ING zur Ausführung einer Verfügung zulasten eines Fremdwährungsguthabens (Abs. 1) oder zur Erfüllung einer Fremdwährungsverbindlichkeit (Abs. 2) ist in dem Umfang und so lange ausgesetzt, wie die ING in der Währung, auf die das Fremdwährungs- guthaben oder die -verbindlichkeit lautet, wegen politisch bedingter Maßnahmen oder Ereignisse im Lande dieser Währung nicht oder nur eingeschränkt verfügen kann. In dem Umfang und solange diese Maß- nahmen oder Ereignisse andauern, ist die ING auch nicht zu einer Erfül- lung an einem anderen Ort außerhalb des Landes der Währung, in einer anderen Währung (auch nicht in Euro) oder durch Anschaffung von Bargeld verpflichtet. Die Verpflichtung der ING zur Ausführung einer Ver- fügung zulasten eines Fremdwährungsguthabens ist dagegen nicht ausgesetzt, wenn sie die ING vollständig im eigenen Haus ausführen kann. Das Recht des Kunden und der ING, fällige gegenseitige Forderun- gen in derselben Währung miteinander zu verrechnen, bleibt von den vorstehenden Regelungen unberührt. (4) Umrechnungskurs Die Bestimmung des Wechselkurses bei Fremdwährungsgeschäften ergibt sich aus dem Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis. Bei Zahlungsdiens- ten gilt ergänzend der Zahlungsdiensterahmenvertrag. 11. Mitwirkungspflichten des Kunden (1) Mitteilung von Änderungen Zur ordnungsgemäßen Abwicklung des Geschäftsverkehrs ist es erfor- derlich, dass der Kunde der ING Änderungen seines Namens und seiner Anschrift sowie das Erlöschen oder die Änderung einer gegenüber der ING erteilten Vertretungsmacht (insbesondere einer Vollmacht) unver- züglich mitteilt. Diese Mitteilungspflicht besteht auch dann, wenn die Vertretungsmacht in ein öffentliches Register (z. B. in das Handels re- gister) eingetragen ist und ihr Erlöschen oder ihre Änderung in dieses Register eingetragen wird. Darüber hinaus können sich weiter gehende gesetzliche Mitteilungspflichten, insbesondere aus dem Geldwäsche- gesetz, ergeben. (2) Klarheit von Aufträgen Aufträge müssen ihren Inhalt zweifelsfrei erkennen lassen. Nicht ein- deutig formulierte Aufträge können Rückfragen zur Folge haben, die zu Verzögerungen führen können. Vor allem hat der Kunde bei Aufträgen auf die Richtigkeit und Vollständigkeit seiner Angaben, insbesondere der Kontonummer und Bankleitzahl oder IBAN1 und BIC2 sowie der Währung, zu achten. Änderungen, Bestätigungen oder Wiederholungen von Aufträgen müssen als solche gekennzeichnet sein. 1 International Bank Account Number (Internationale Bankkontonummer). 2 Bank Identifier Code (Bankcode). 18 Der Besicherungsanspruch der ING besteht nicht, wenn ausdrücklich vereinbart ist, dass der Kunde keine oder ausschließlich im Einzelnen benannte Sicherheiten zu bestellen hat. Bei Verbraucherdarlehens- verträgen besteht der Anspruch auf die Bestellung oder Verstärkung von Sicher heiten nur, soweit die Sicherheiten im Kreditvertrag angegeben sind. Übersteigt der Nettodarlehensbetrag 75.000 Euro, besteht der Anspruch auf Bestellung oder Verstärkung auch dann, wenn in einem vor dem 21. März 2016 abgeschlossenen Verbraucherdarlehensvertrag oder in einem ab dem 21. März 2016 abgeschlossenen Allgemein-Ver- braucherdarlehensvertrag im Sinne von § 491 Absatz 2 BGB keine oder keine abschließenden Angaben über Sicherheiten enthalten sind. (3) Fristsetzung für die Bestellung oder Verstärkung von Sicherheiten Für die Bestellung oder Verstärkung von Sicherheiten wird die ING eine angemessene Frist einräumen. Beabsichtigt die ING, von ihrem Recht zur fristlosen Kündigung nach Nummer 19 Absatz 3 dieser Geschäfts- bedingungen Gebrauch zu machen, falls der Kunde seiner Verpflichtung zur Bestellung oder Verstärkung von Sicherheiten nicht fristgerecht nachkommt, wird sie ihn zuvor hierauf hinweisen. 14. Vereinbarung eines Pfandrechts zugunsten der ING (1) Einigung über das Pfandrecht Der Kunde und die ING sind sich darüber einig, dass die ING ein Pfand- recht an den Wertpapieren und Sachen erwirbt, an denen eine inlän- dische Geschäfts stelle im bankmäßigen Geschäftsverkehr Besitz erlangt hat oder noch erlangen wird. Die ING erwirbt ein Pfandrecht auch an den Ansprüchen, die dem Kunden gegen die ING aus der bankmäßigen Geschäftsverbindung zustehen oder künftig zustehen werden (z. B. Kontoguthaben). (2) Gesicherte Ansprüche Das Pfandrecht dient der Sicherung aller bestehenden, künftigen und beding ten Ansprüche, die der ING mit ihren sämtlichen in- und auslän- dischen Geschäftsstellen aus der bankmäßigen Geschäftsverbindung gegen den Kunden zustehen. Hat der Kunde gegenüber der ING eine Haftung für Verbindlichkeiten eines anderen Kunden der ING übernom- men (z. B. als Bürge), so sichert das Pfandrecht die aus der Haftungs- übernahme folgende Schuld jedoch erst ab ihrer Fälligkeit. (3) Ausnahmen vom Pfandrecht Gelangen Gelder oder andere Werte mit der Maßgabe in die Verfügungs- gewalt der ING, dass sie nur für einen bestimmten Zweck verwendet werden dürfen (z. B. Bareinzahlung zur Einlösung eines Wechsels), erstreckt sich das Pfandrecht der ING nicht auf diese Werte. Dasselbe gilt für die von der ING selbst ausgegebenen Aktien (eigene Aktien) und für die Wertpapiere, die die ING im Ausland für den Kunden verwahrt. Außerdem erstreckt sich das Pfandrecht nicht auf die von der ING selbst ausgegebenen eigenen Genussrechte/Genussscheine und nicht auf die verbrieften und nicht verbrieften nachrangigen Verbindlichkeiten der ING. (4) Zins- und Gewinnanteilscheine Unterliegen dem Pfandrecht der ING Wertpapiere, ist der Kunde nicht berechtigt, die Herausgabe der zu diesen Papieren gehörenden Zins- und Gewinnanteilscheine zu verlangen. 15. Sicherungsrechte bei Einzugspapieren und diskontierten Wechseln (1) Sicherungsübereignung Die ING erwirbt an den ihr zum Einzug eingereichten Schecks und Wech- seln im Zeitpunkt der Einreichung Sicherungseigentum. An diskontierten Wechseln erwirbt die ING im Zeitpunkt des Wechselankaufs unein- geschränktes Eigentum; belastet sie diskontierte Wechsel dem Konto zurück, so verbleibt ihr das Sicherungseigentum an diesen Wechseln. (2) Sicherungsabtretung Mit dem Erwerb des Eigentums an Schecks und Wechseln gehen auch die zugrunde liegenden Forderungen auf die ING über; ein Forderungs- übergang findet ferner statt, wenn andere Papiere zum Einzug einge- reicht werden (z. B. Lastschriften, kaufmännische Handelspapiere). (3) Zweckgebundene Einzugspapiere Werden der ING Einzugspapiere mit der Maßgabe eingereicht, dass ihr Gegen wert nur für einen bestimmten Zweck verwendet werden darf, erstrecken sich die Sicherungsübereignung und die Sicherungsabtretung nicht auf diese Papiere. Im Übrigen bestimmt die ING, sofern keine andere Vereinbarung getroffen wurde und gesetzliche Bestimmungen dem nicht entgegenstehen, die Höhe von Zinsen und Entgelten nach billigem Ermessen (§ 315 des Bürger lichen Gesetzbuchs). (3) Nicht entgeltfähige Leistungen Für eine Leistung, zu deren Erbringung die ING kraft Gesetzes oder auf- grund einer vertraglichen Nebenpflicht verpflichtet ist oder die sie im eigenen Interesse wahrnimmt, wird die ING kein Entgelt berechnen, es sei denn, es ist gesetzlich zulässig und wird nach Maßgabe der gesetz- lichen Regelung erhoben. (4) Änderung von Zinsen; Kündigungsrecht des Kunden bei Erhöhung Die Änderung der Zinsen bei Krediten mit einem veränderlichen Zinssatz erfolgt aufgrund der jeweiligen Kreditvereinbarung mit dem Kunden. Die ING wird dem Kunden Änderungen von Zinsen mitteilen. Bei einer Erhöhung kann der Kunde, sofern nichts anderes vereinbart ist, die davon betroffene Kreditvereinbarung innerhalb von 6 Wochen nach der Bekanntgabe der Änderung mit sofortiger Wirkung kündigen. Kündigt der Kunde, so werden die erhöhten Zinsen für die gekündigte Kreditver- einbarung nicht zugrunde gelegt. Die ING wird zur Abwicklung eine angemessene Frist einräumen. (5) Änderungen von Entgelten bei typischerweise dauerhaft in Anspruch genommenen Leistungen Änderungen von Entgelten für Bankleistungen, die von Kunden im Rah- men der Geschäftsverbindung typischerweise dauerhaft in Anspruch genommen werden (zum Beispiel Konto- und Depotführung), werden dem Kunden spätestens zwei Monate vor dem vorgeschlagenen Zeit- punkt ihres Wirksamwerdens in Textform angeboten. Hat der Kunde mit der ING im Rahmen der Geschäftsbeziehung einen elektronischen Kom- munikationsweg vereinbart (zum Beispiel das Internetbanking), können die Änderungen auch auf diesem Wege angeboten werden. Die von der ING angebotenen Änderungen werden nur wirksam, wenn der Kunde diese annimmt. Eine Vereinbarung über die Änderung eines Entgelts, das auf eine über die Hauptleistung hinausgehende Zahlung eines Ver- brauchers gerichtet ist, kann die ING mit dem Verbraucher nur aus- drücklich treffen. (6) Ersatz von Aufwendungen Ein möglicher Anspruch der ING auf Ersatz von Aufwendungen richtet sich nach den gesetzlichen Vorschriften. (7) Besonderheiten bei Verbraucherdarlehensverträgen und Zahlungs- diensteverträgen mit Verbrauchern für Zahlungen Bei Verbraucherdarlehensverträgen und Zahlungsdiensteverträgen mit Verbrauchern für Zahlungen richten sich die Zinsen und die Kosten (Entgelte und Auslagen) nach den jeweiligen vertraglichen Vereinbarun- gen und Sonderbedingungen sowie ergänzend nach den gesetzlichen Vorschriften. 13. Sicherheiten für die Ansprüche der Bank gegen den Kunden (1) Anspruch der ING auf Bestellung von Sicherheiten Die ING kann für alle Ansprüche aus der bankmäßigen Geschäfts- verbindung die Bestellung bankmäßiger Sicherheiten verlangen, und zwar auch dann, wenn die Ansprüche bedingt sind (zum Beispiel Aufwendungsersatzanspruch wegen der Inanspruchnahme aus einer für den Kunden übernommenen Bürgschaft). Hat der Kunde gegenüber der ING eine Haftung für Verbindlichkeiten eines anderen Kunden der ING übernommen (zum Beispiel als Bürge), so besteht für die ING ein Anspruch auf Bestellung oder Verstärkung von Sicherheiten im Hinblick auf die aus der Haftungsübernahme folgende Schuld jedoch erst ab ihrer Fälligkeit. (2) Veränderungen des Risikos Hat die ING bei der Entstehung von Ansprüchen gegen den Kunden zunächst ganz oder teilweise davon abgesehen, die Bestellung oder Verstärkung von Sicherheiten zu verlangen, kann sie auch später noch eine Besicherung fordern. Voraussetzung hierfür ist jedoch, dass Umstände eintreten oder bekannt werden, die eine erhöhte Risikobe- wertung der Ansprüche gegen den Kunden rechtfertigen. Dies kann insbesondere der Fall sein, wenn sich die wirtschaftlichen Verhältnisse des Kunden nachteilig verändert haben oder sich zu verändern drohen oder sich die vorhandenen Sicherheiten wertmäßig verschlechtert haben oder zu verschlechtern drohen. 19 19. Kündigungsrechte der ING (1) Kündigung unter Einhaltung einer Kündigungsfrist Die ING kann die gesamte Geschäftsverbindung oder einzelne Geschäfts- beziehungen, für die weder eine Laufzeit noch eine abweichende Kün- digungsregelung vereinbart ist, jederzeit unter Einhaltung einer angemes- senen Kündigungsfrist kündigen (zum Beispiel den Scheckvertrag, der zur Nutzung von Scheckvordrucken berechtigt). Bei der Bemessung der Kündigungsfrist wird die ING auf die berechtigten Belange des Kunden Rücksicht nehmen. Für die Kündigung eines Zahlungsdiensterahmen- vertrags (z. B. laufendes Konto oder Kartenvertrag) und eines Depots beträgt die Kündigungsfrist mindestens 2 Monate. (2) Kündigung unbefristeter Kredite Kredite und Kreditzusagen, für die weder eine Laufzeit noch eine abwei- chende Kündigungsregelung vereinbart ist, kann die ING jederzeit ohne Einhaltung einer Kündigungsfrist kündigen. Die ING wird bei der Aus- übung dieses Kündigungsrechts auf die berechtigten Belange des Kunden Rücksicht nehmen. Soweit das Bürgerliche Gesetzbuch Sonderrege- lungen für die Kündigung eines Verbraucherdarlehensvertrags vorsieht, kann die ING nur nach Maßgabe dieser Regelungen kündigen. (3) Kündigung aus wichtigem Grund ohne Einhaltung einer Kündigungsfrist Eine fristlose Kündigung der gesamten Geschäftsverbindung oder ein- zelner Geschäftsbeziehungen ist zulässig, wenn ein wichtiger Grund vorliegt, der der ING deren Fortsetzung auch unter Berücksichtigung der berechtigten Belange des Kunden unzumutbar werden lässt. Ein wich- tiger Grund liegt insbesondere vor, • wenn der Kunde unrichtige Angaben über seine Vermögensverhält- nisse gemacht hat, die für die Entscheidung der ING über eine Kredit- gewährung oder über andere mit Risiken für die ING verbundene Geschäfte (z. B. Aushändigung einer Zahlungskarte) von erheblicher Bedeutung waren; bei Verbraucherdarlehen gilt dies nur, wenn der Kunde für die Kreditwürdigkeitsprüfung relevante Informationen wissentlich vorenthalten oder diese gefälscht hat und dies zu einem Mangel der Kreditwürdigkeitsprüfung geführt hat, oder • wenn eine wesentliche Verschlechterung der Vermögensverhältnisse des Kunden oder der Werthaltigkeit einer Sicherheit eintritt oder einzutreten droht und dadurch die Rückzahlung des Darlehens oder die Erfüllung einer sonstigen Verbindlichkeit gegenüber der ING – auch unter Verwertung einer hierfür bestehenden Sicherheit – gefährdet ist oder • wenn der Kunde seiner Verpflichtung zur Bestellung oder Verstärkung von Sicherheiten nach Nummer 13 Absatz 2 dieser Geschäfts- bedingungen oder aufgrund einer sonstigen Vereinbarung nicht inner- halb der von der ING gesetzten angemessenen Frist nachkommt. Besteht der wichtige Grund in der Verletzung einer vertraglichen Pflicht, ist die Kündigung erst nach erfolglosem Ablauf einer zur Abhilfe bestimmten angemessenen Frist oder nach erfolgloser Abmahnung zulässig, es sei denn, dies ist wegen der Besonderheiten des Einzelfalls (§ 323 Absatz 2 und 3 des Bürgerlichen Gesetzbuches) entbehrlich. (4) Kündigung von Verbraucherdarlehensverträgen bei Verzug Soweit das Bürgerliche Gesetzbuch Sonderregelungen für die Kündigung wegen Verzugs mit der Rückzahlung eines Verbraucherdarlehens- vertrags vorsieht, kann die ING nur nach Maßgabe dieser Regelungen kündigen. (5) Kündigung eines Basiskontovertrags Einen Basiskontovertrag kann die ING nur nach den zwischen der ING und dem Kunden auf Grundlage des Zahlungskontengesetzes getroffenen Vereinbarungen und den Bestimmungen des Zahlungskontengesetzes kündigen. (6) Abwicklung nach einer Kündigung Im Falle einer Kündigung ohne Kündigungsfrist wird die ING dem Kunden für die Abwicklung (insbesondere für die Rückzahlung eines Kredits) eine angemessene Frist einräumen, soweit nicht eine sofortige Erledigung erforderlich ist (zum Beispiel bei der Kündigung des Scheckvertrags die Rückgabe der Scheckvordrucke). (4) Gesicherte Ansprüche der ING Das Sicherungseigentum und die Sicherungsabtretung dienen der Siche- rung aller Ansprüche, die der ING gegen den Kunden bei Einreichung von Einzugspapieren aus seinen Kontokorrentkonten zustehen oder die infolge der Rückbelastung nicht eingelöster Einzugspapiere oder diskon- tierter Wechsel entstehen. Auf Anforderung des Kunden nimmt die ING eine Rückübertragung des Sicherungseigentums an den Papieren und der auf sie übergegangenen Forderungen an den Kunden vor, falls ihr im Zeitpunkt der Anforderung keine zu sichernden Ansprüche gegen den Kunden zustehen oder sie ihn über den Gegenwert der Papiere vor deren endgültiger Bezahlung nicht verfügen lässt. 16. Begrenzung des Besicherungsanspruchs und Freigabeverpflichtung (1) Deckungsgrenze Die ING kann ihren Anspruch auf Bestellung oder Verstärkung von Sicher heiten so lange geltend machen, bis der realisierbare Wert aller Sicher heiten dem Gesamtbetrag aller Ansprüche aus der bankmäßigen Geschäftsverbindung (Deckungsgrenze) entspricht. (2) Freigabe Falls der realisierbare Wert aller Sicherheiten die Deckungsgrenze nicht nur vorübergehend übersteigt, hat die ING auf Verlangen des Kunden Sicherheiten nach ihrer Wahl freizugeben, und zwar in Höhe des die Deckungsgrenze übersteigenden Betrags; sie wird bei der Auswahl der freizugebenden Sicherheiten auf die berechtigten Belange des Kunden und eines dritten Sicherungsgebers, der für die Verbindlichkeiten des Kunden Sicherheiten bestellt hat, Rücksicht nehmen. In diesem Rahmen ist die ING auch verpflichtet, Aufträge des Kunden über die dem Pfand- recht unterliegenden Werte auszuführen (z. B. Verkauf von Wertpapieren, Auszahlung von Sparguthaben). (3) Sondervereinbarungen Ist für eine bestimmte Sicherheit ein anderer Bewertungsmaßstab als der realisierbare Wert oder ist eine andere Deckungsgrenze oder eine andere Grenze für die Freigabe von Sicherheiten vereinbart, so sind diese maßgeblich. 17. Verwertung von Sicherheiten (1) Wahlrecht der ING Wenn die ING verwertet, hat sie unter mehreren Sicherheiten die Wahl. Sie wird bei der Verwertung und bei der Auswahl der zu verwertenden Sicherheiten auf die berechtigten Belange des Kunden und eines dritten Sicherungsgebers, der für die Verbindlichkeiten des Kunden Sicherheiten bestellt hat, Rücksicht nehmen. (2) Erlösgutschrift nach dem Umsatzsteuerrecht Wenn der Verwertungsvorgang der Umsatzsteuer unterliegt, wird die ING dem Kunden über den Erlös eine Gutschrift erteilen, die als Rech- nung für die Lieferung der als Sicherheit dienenden Sache gilt und den Voraussetzungen des Umsatzsteuerrechts entspricht. 18. Kündigungsrechte des Kunden (1) Jederzeitiges Kündigungsrecht Der Kunde kann die gesamte Geschäftsverbindung oder einzelne Geschäftsbeziehungen (zum Beispiel den Scheckvertrag, der zur Nutzung der Scheckkarte und von Scheckvordrucken berechtigt), für die weder eine Laufzeit noch eine abweichende Kündigungsregelung ver- einbart ist, jederzeit ohne Einhaltung einer Kündigungsfrist kündigen. (2) Kündigung aus wichtigem Grund Ist für eine Geschäftsbeziehung eine Laufzeit oder eine abweichende Kündigungsregelung vereinbart, kann eine fristlose Kündigung nur dann ausgesprochen werden, wenn hierfür ein wichtiger Grund vorliegt, der es dem Kunden, auch unter Berücksichtigung der berechtigten Belange der ING, unzumutbar werden lässt, die Geschäftsbeziehung fortzusetzen. (3) Gesetzliche Kündigungsrechte Gesetzliche Kündigungsrechte bleiben unberührt. 20 kann. Die Sicherungsgrenze wird dem Kunden von der ING auf Verlangen bekannt gegeben. Nicht geschützt werden insbesondere Einlagen von finanziellen Unter- nehmen, staatlichen Stellen einschließlich kommunaler Gebietskörper- schaften, Einlagen, die im Zusammenhang mit Geldwäsche oder Terro- rismusfinanzierung entstanden sind, und Inhaberschuldverschreibungen. Im Fall von Gläubigern nach Buchstaben (b)(ii), (c)(ii) und (d)(ii) werden Einlagen mit einer Laufzeit von mehr als 12 Monaten sowie Verbindlich- keiten aus Schuldscheindarlehen, Namenschuldverschreibungen und vergleichbaren Schuldtiteln ausländischen Rechts nicht geschützt. Für Verbindlichkeiten von Banken, die bis zum Ablauf des 31. Dezember 2022 gemäß § 6 der am 18. November 2021 im Vereinsregister einge- tragenen Fassung des Statuts des Einlagensicherungsfonds gesichert wurden, besteht die Sicherung nach Maßgabe dieser Vorschrift fort. Nach dem 31. Dezember 2022 entfällt dieser Bestandsschutz, sobald die betreffende Verbindlichkeit fällig wird, gekündigt oder anderweitig zurückgefordert werden kann, oder wenn die Verbindlichkeit im Wege einer Einzel- oder Gesamtrechtsnachfolge übergeht oder auf eine ausländische Zweigniederlassung oder Zweigstelle übertragen wird. Einzelheiten zum Schutzumfang einschließlich der Sicherungsgrenzen sind im Statut des Einlagensicherungsfonds, insbesondere dessen § 6 geregelt. Das Statut wird auf Verlangen zur Verfügung gestellt und kann auch im Internet unter www.bankenverband.de aufgerufen werden. Forderungsübergang und Auskunftserteilung (4) Forderungsübergang Soweit der Einlagensicherungsfonds oder ein von ihm Beauftragter Zahlungen an einen Kunden leistet, gehen dessen Forderungen gegen die ING in entsprechender Höhe mit allen Nebenrechten Zug um Zug auf den Einlagensicherungsfonds über. (5) Auskunftserteilung Die ING ist befugt, dem Einlagensicherungsfonds oder einem von ihnen Beauftragten alle in diesem Zusammenhang erforderlichen Auskünfte zu erteilen und Unterlagen zur Verfügung zu stellen. Beschwerde- und Streitbeilegungsverfahren 21. Beschwerde- und Alternative Streitbeilegungs- verfahren Der Kunde hat folgende außergerichtliche Möglichkeiten: • Der Kunde kann sich mit einer Beschwerde an die im Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis genannte Kontaktstelle der ING wenden. Die ING wird Beschwerden in geeigneter Weise beantworten, bei Zahlungs- diensteverträgen erfolgt dies in Textform (zum Beispiel mittels Brief, Telefax oder E-Mail). • Die ING nimmt am Streitbeilegungsverfahren der Verbraucherschlich- tungsstelle „Ombudsmann der privaten Banken“ (www.bankenombudsmann.de) teil. Dort hat der Verbraucher die Mög- lichkeit, zur Beilegung einer Streitigkeit mit der ING den Ombudsmann der privaten Banken anzurufen. Betrifft der Beschwerdegegenstand eine Streitigkeit über einen Zahlungsdienstevertrag (§ 675f des Bürger- lichen Gesetzbuches), können auch Kunden, die keine Verbraucher sind, den Ombudsmann der privaten Banken anrufen. Näheres regelt die „Verfahrensordnung für die Schlichtung von Kundenbeschwerden im deutschen Bankgewerbe“, die auf Wunsch zur Verfügung gestellt wird oder im Internet unter www.bankenverband.de abrufbar ist. Die Beschwerde ist in Textform (zum Beispiel mittels Brief, Telefax oder E-Mail) an die Kundenbeschwerdestelle beim Bundesverband deutscher Banken e. V., Postfach 04 03 07, 10062 Berlin, Fax: (030) 1663-3169, E-Mail: <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS>, zu richten. • Ferner besteht für den Kunden die Möglichkeit, sich jederzeit schriftlich oder zur dortigen Niederschrift bei der Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienst- leistungsaufsicht, Graurheindorfer Straße 108, 53117 Bonn, über Ver- stöße der Bank gegen das Zahlungsdiensteaufsichtsgesetz (ZAG), die §§ 675c bis 676c des Bürgerlichen Gesetzbuches (BGB) oder gegen Artikel 248 des Einführungsgesetzes zum Bürgerlichen Gesetzbuche (EGBGB) zu beschweren. • Die Europäische Kommission hat unter http://ec.europa.eu/consumers/ odr/ eine Europäische Online-Streitbeilegungsplattform (OS-Plattform) errichtet. Die OS-Plattform kann ein Verbraucher für die außergericht- Schutz der Einlagen 20. Information über die Einlagensicherung (1) Einlagen Einlagen sind Guthaben, die sich im Rahmen von Bankgeschäften aus Beträgen, die auf einem Konto verblieben sind, oder aus Zwischenposi- tionen ergeben und die nach den geltenden gesetzlichen und vertrag- lichen Bedingungen von der ING zurückzuzahlen sind, wie zum Beispiel Guthaben auf Girokonten, Festgelder, Spareinlagen, Sparbriefe und Namensschuldverschreibungen. Maßgeblich sind die Definitionen in § 2 Absatz 3 des Einlagensicherungsgesetzes (EinSiG) bzw. § 6 Absatz 1 des Statuts des innerhalb des Bundesverbandes deutscher Banken e.V. bestehenden Einlagensicherungsfonds deutscher Banken (Einlagen- sicherungsfonds). (2) Gesetzliche Einlagensicherung Die ING ist der Entschädigungseinrichtung deutscher Banken GmbH als Träger der gesetzliche Einlagensicherung der privaten Banken zugeordnet. Die gesetzliche Einlagensicherung schützt nach Maßgabe des EinSiG und vorbehaltlich der darin vorgesehenen Ausnahmen Einlagen bis zu einem Gegenwert von 100.000 € pro Einleger. In den in § 8 Absatz 2 EinSiG genannten Fällen erhöht sich dieser Betrag auf 500.000 €. Dazu gehören insbesondere Beträge, die aus Immobilientransaktionen im Zusammen- hang mit privat genutzten Wohnimmobilien resultieren. Nicht geschützt werden insbesondere Einlagen von finanziellen Unternehmen, staatli- chen Stellen einschließlich kommunaler Gebietskörperschaften, Einlagen, die im Zusammenhang mit Geldwäsche oder Terrorismusfinanzierung entstanden sind, und Inhaberschuldverschreibungen. Einzelheiten sind im EinSiG, insbesondere dessen § 8 geregelt. (3) Einlagensicherungsfonds Die ING wirkt außerdem am Einlagensicherungsfonds mit. Dieser sichert nach Maßgabe seines Statuts und vorbehaltlich der darin vorgesehenen Ausnahmen Einlagen bei einer inländischen Haupt- oder Zweignieder- lassung bzw. Zweigstelle je Gläubiger maximal bis zur folgenden Höhe (Sicherungsgrenze): (a) (i) 5 Mio. € für natürliche Personen und rechtsfähige Stiftungen unabhängig von ihrer Laufzeit und (ii) 50 Mio. € für nichtfinanzielle Unternehmen, gemeinnützige Orga- nisationen, Verbände und Berufsorganisationen ohne Erwerbs- zweck und anderer in § 6 Absatz 3 des Statuts des Einlagensiche- rungsfonds genannter Gläubiger. In jedem Fall werden Einlagen bis maximal 15 % der Eigenmittel der Bank im Sinne von Artikel 72 CRR geschützt, wobei Ergänzungskapital nur bis zur Höhe von 25 % des Kernkapitals im Sinne von Artikel 25 CRR Berücksichtigung findet. Weitere Einzelheiten zur Berechnung der relevanten Eigenmittel regelt § 6 Absatz 8 Unterabsatz (a) des Statuts des Einlagensicherungsfonds. (b) Ab dem 1. Januar 2025: (i) 3 Mio. € für natürliche Personen und rechtsfähige Stiftungen unabhängig von ihrer Laufzeit und (ii) 30 Mio. € für nichtfinanzielle Unternehmen, gemeinnützige Orga- nisationen, Verbände und Berufsorganisationen ohne Erwerbs- zweck und anderer in § 6 Absatz 3 des Statuts des Einlagensiche- rungsfonds genannter Gläubiger. In jedem Fall werden Einlagen bis maximal 8,75 % der Eigenmittel im Sinne von Unterabsatz (a) Sätzen 2 und 3 geschützt. (c) Ab dem 1. Januar 2030: (i) 1 Mio. € für natürliche Personen und rechtsfähige Stiftungen unabhängig von ihrer Laufzeit und (ii) 10 Mio. € für nichtfinanzielle Unternehmen, gemeinnützige Orga- nisationen, Verbände und Berufsorganisationen ohne Erwerbs- zweck und anderer in § 6 Absatz 3 des Statuts des Einlagensiche- rungsfonds genannter Gläubiger. In jedem Fall werden Einlagen bis maximal 8,75 % der Eigenmittel im Sinne von Unterabsatz (a) Sätzen 2 und 3 geschützt. (d) Für Einlagen, die bis zum Ablauf des 31. Dezember 2022 gesichert wurden, finden die zu diesem Zeitpunkt geltenden Sicherungsgrenzen weiterhin Anwendung bis die Einlage fällig ist, prolongiert wird oder vom Kunden erstmals gekündigt werden kann oder auf eine aus- ländische Zweigniederlassung oder Zweigstellen übertragen wird. Für Einlagen, die nach dem 31. Dezember 2022 begründet oder prolongiert werden, gelten die jeweils neuen Sicherungsgrenzen ab den oben genannten Stichtagen. Maßgebend für die Entschädigung ist die Sicherungsgrenze, die der ING als Ergebnis der Feststellung des Prüfungsverbandes mitgeteilt worden ist und im Internet unter www.bankenverband.de abgerufen werden 21 ten Sicherheitsmerkmals des Kunden überprüfen kann. Mit den hierfür vereinbarten Authentifizierungselementen kann der Kunde sich gegen- über der ING als berechtigter Teilnehmer ausweisen, auf Informationen zugreifen (siehe Nummer 4 dieser Vereinbarungen) sowie Aufträge erteilen (siehe Nummer 5 dieser Vereinbarungen). (3) Authentifizierungselemente sind • Wissenselemente, also etwas, das nur der Kunde weiß (z. B. die persön- liche Geheimzahl [PIN – z. B. Internetbanking PIN oder mobile PIN] oder ein Passwort), • Besitzelemente, also etwas, das nur der Kunde besitzt (z. B. mobiles Endgerät, das für die Nutzung der Banking to go App durch den Kunden registriert ist oder ein Gerät zur Erzeugung oder zum Empfang von einmal verwendbaren Transaktionsnummern [TAN], die den Besitz des Kunden nachweisen, wie den TANGenerator), oder • Seinselemente, also etwas, das der Kunde ist (Inhärenz, z. B. Finger- abdruck als biometrisches Merkmal des Kunden). (4) Die Authentifizierung des Kunden erfolgt, indem der Kunde gemäß den Anforderungen der ING das Wissenselement, den Nachweis des Besitzelements und/oder den Nachweis des Seinselements an die ING übermittelt. 4. Zugang zum Telebanking und zum Internet- banking (Login) (1) Der Kunde erhält Zugang zum Internet- und Telebanking der ING, wenn • er seine Zugangsdaten (z. B. Zugangsnummer, PIN, DiBa Key, Passwort) angibt oder sich zum Internetbanking per QR-Code anmeldet und • er sich unter Verwendung des oder der von der ING angeforderten Authentifizierungselemente ausweist und • keine Sperre des Zugangs vorliegt. Nach Gewährung des Zugangs zum Internet- und Telebanking kann der Kunde auf Informationen zugreifen oder nach Nummer 5 dieser Verein- barungen Aufträge erteilen. (2) Für den Zugriff auf sensible Zahlungsdaten im Sinne des § 1 Absatz 26 Satz 1 ZAG (z. B. zum Zweck der Änderung der Anschrift des Kunden) fordert die ING den Kunden auf, sich unter Verwendung eines weiteren Authentifizierungselements auszuweisen, wenn beim Zugang zum Internetbanking nur ein Authentifizierungselement angefordert wurde. Der Name des Kunden und die Kontonummer sind für den vom Kunden genutzten Zahlungsauslösedienst und Kontoinformationsdienst keine sensiblen Zahlungsdaten (§ 1 Absatz 26 Satz 2 ZAG). (3) Die von der ING dem Kunden zur Nutzung des Internetbanking erteilten Wissenselemente muss der Kunde in nur ihm bekannte Wissens- elemente umwandeln. Erst dann stehen dem Kunden die Dienste des Internetbanking zur Verfügung. Er kann jederzeit seine Wissenselemente ändern und seine Authentifizierungselemente sperren bzw. löschen und neue anfordern bzw. registrieren. Bei einer Änderung der Authentifizie- rungselemente werden die bisherigen ungültig. Eine Sperre kann durch ein vom Kunden unterzeichnetes Schreiben (im Original, nicht per Tele- fax), per Telebanking oder über das Internetbanking veranlasst werden. In Notfällen steht die Telefonnummer des Rund-um-die-Uhr-Sperr- dienstes zur Verfügung, die über die Internetseite der ING zu erfahren ist. (4) Falls der Zugriff über Kommunikationsmittel erfolgt, die anderen Betreibern unterstehen, obliegt es dem Kunden, die dafür notwendigen Vorkehrungen zu treffen und sicherzustellen, dass alle gesetzlichen und technischen Vorschriften eingehalten werden. 5. Auftragserteilung (1) Der Kunde muss einem per Internet- oder Telebanking erteilten Auf- trag (z. B. einer Überweisung) zu dessen Wirksamkeit zustimmen (Auto- risierung). Auf Anforderung hat der Kunde hierzu Authentifizierungs- elemente (z. B. bei Nutzung der Banking to go App die Eingabe der mobile- PIN oder die Verwendung des Fingerabdrucks) zu verwenden. Die ING bestätigt mittels Internet- oder Telebanking den Eingang des Auftrags. (2) Weisungen und sonstige rechtsgeschäftliche Erklärungen sind wirk- sam abgegeben, wenn der Kunde die in der Benutzerführung vorge- schriebene Freigabe zur Übermittlung vorgenommen hat. Bei Vorgängen, die zum Beispiel der Autorisierung bedürfen, ist die Freigabe maßge- liche Beilegung einer Streitigkeit aus Online-Verträgen mit einem in der EU nieder gelas se nen Unternehmen nutzen. • Zusätzlich zu den vorgenannten Beschwerde- und Streitbeilegungs- verfahren steht dem Kunden auch die Möglichkeit einer zivilrechtlichen Klage offen. Vereinbarungen zum Internet- banking inklusive Post-Box und Telebanking 1. Einleitung Für die Führung der Konten und Depots (nachfolgend „Konten“) der ING ist die Nutzung des Internetbanking und des Telebanking vorgesehen. 1.1 Internetbanking Die ING und der Kunde haben vereinbart, dass die Konto- und Depotfüh- rung per Internetbanking inklusive Post-Box erfolgt. Die Abwicklung von Bank- und Wertpapiergeschäften erfolgt über das Internetbanking. Hierfür hält die ING selbst oder damit von ihr beauftragte Dritte die erfor- derlichen Einrichtungen vor und schafft die Voraussetzungen für den authentischen, vertraulichen, integren und verbindlichen Austausch von Daten zwischen dem Kunden und der ING über das Internet. Ausführ- liche Sicherheitshinweise erhält der Kunde über die Homepage der ING. Die Nutzung der Banking to go App wird als das Standardverfahren zur Authentifizierung und Autorisierung vereinbart. Unter Internetbanking sind die Banking- und Brokerage-Funktionen auf der Unternehmens-Website, angebotene Funktionen des Mobile Banking sowie alle Funktionen und Applikationen (z. B. Apps) zu verstehen, welche die ING ihren Kunden zur Verfügung stellt. 1.2 Telebanking Neben dem Internetbanking kann der Kunde auch per Telefon mittels Telebanking in dem von der ING angebotenen Umfang Bankgeschäfte abwickeln und Informationen abrufen. 2. Teilnahme (1) Der Kunde kann Bank- und Wertpapiergeschäfte mittels Internet- banking und Telebanking in dem angebotenen Umfang abwickeln. Zudem kann er Informationen der ING mittels Internetbanking abrufen. Im Rahmen des Internetbanking ist er zusätzlich berechtigt, für die Auslösung eines Zahlungsauftrages einen Zahlungsauslösedienst gem. § 1 Absatz 33 Zahlungsdiensteaufsichtsgesetz und für die Mitteilung von Informationen über ein Zahlungskonto einen Kontoinformations- dienst gem. § 1 Absatz 34 Zahlungsdiensteaufsichtsgesetz zu nutzen. (2) Die ING hat das Recht, den Umfang der über das Internet- und Tele- banking abwickelbaren Geschäftsvorgänge sowie, die Art und Weise der Nutzung des Internet- und Telebanking unter Berücksichtigung der berechtigten Belange des Kunden jederzeit zu verändern oder von weiteren Auflagen abhängig zu machen. Die ING wird den Kunden über derartige Änderungen rechtzeitig in geeigneter Form unterrichten. (3) Gemeinschaftskontokunden und verfügungsberechtigte Dritte können das Telebanking nutzen, wenn sie jeweils über eigene Authentifizierungs- elemente verfügen. 3. Nutzungsvoraussetzungen (1) Der Kunde kann das Internet- und Telebanking nutzen, wenn die Bank ihn authen tifiziert hat. (2) Authentifizierung ist das Verfahren, mit dessen Hilfe die ING die Iden- tität des Kunden oder die berechtigte Verwendung eines vereinbarten Zahlungsinstruments, einschließlich der Verwendung des personalisier- 22 8. Information des Kunden über Internet- und Telebanking- Verfügungen (1) Die ING unterrichtet den Kontoinhaber über die mittels Internet- und Telebanking getätigten Verfügungen in der für Kontoinformationen vereinbarten Art und Weise. (2) Der Kunde hat die ihm im Internetbanking mitgeteilten Umsatzinfor- mationen und Ausführungsdaten auf ihre Vollständigkeit und Richtigkeit zu überprüfen. (3) Der Kunde ist verpflichtet, sich nach Erteilung von Zahlungsaufträgen oder Aufträgen sonstiger Art von der Ausführung des Auftrags durch die ING unverzüglich zu vergewissern. Nicht autorisierte oder fehlerhaft ausgeführte Aufträge hat der Kunde der ING unverzüglich anzuzeigen. Dabei zu beachtende Fristen richten sich nach den für die jeweilige Auf- tragsart geltenden Sonderbedingungen. 9. Sorgfaltspflichten des Kunden 9.1 Schutz der Authentifizierungselemente (1) Der Kunde hat alle zumutbaren Vorkehrungen zu treffen, um seine Authentifizierungselemente (siehe Nummer 3 Absatz 3 dieser Verein- barungen) vor unbefugtem Zugriff zu schützen. Ansonsten besteht die Gefahr, dass das Internet- und Telebanking missbräuchlich verwendet oder in sonstiger Weise nicht autorisiert genutzt wird (vergleiche Num- mer 4 und 5 dieser Vereinbarungen). (2) Zum Schutz der einzelnen Authentifizierungselemente hat der Kunde vor allem Folgendes zu beachten: (a) Wissenselemente, wie z. B. PIN, sind geheim zu halten; sie dürfen insbesondere • nicht mündlich (z. B. telefonisch oder persönlich) mitgeteilt werden, • nicht außerhalb des Internet- und Telebanking in Textform (z. B. per E-Mail, Messenger Dienst) weitergegeben werden, • nicht ungesichert elektronisch gespeichert (z. B. Speicherung der PIN im Klartext im Computer oder mobilen Endgerät) werden und • nicht auf einem Gerät notiert oder als Abschrift zusammen mit einem Gerät aufbewahrt werden, das als Besitzelement (z. B. TAN-Generator, mobiles Endgerät) oder zur Prüfung des Seinselements (z. B. mobiles Endgerät mit Banking to go App und Fingerabdrucksensor) dient. (b) Besitzelemente, z. B. der TAN-Generator oder ein mobiles Endgerät, sind vor Missbrauch zu schützen, insbesondere • sind der TAN-Generator oder das mobile Endgerät vor dem unbefugten Zugriff anderer Personen sicher zu verwahren, • ist sicherzustellen, dass unberechtigte Personen auf das mobile End- gerät des Teilnehmers (z. B. Mobiltelefon) nicht zugreifen können, • ist dafür Sorge zu tragen, dass andere Personen die auf dem mobilen Endgerät (z. B. Smartphone, Tablet) befindlichen Anwendungen für das Internetbanking (z. B. Banking to go App) nicht nutzen können, • ist die Anwendung für das Internetbanking (z. B. Banking to go App) auf dem mobilen Endgerät des Kunden zu deaktivieren, bevor der Kunde den Besitz an diesem mobilen Endgerät aufgibt (z. B. durch Verkauf oder Entsorgung des Mobiltelefons), • dürfen die Nachweise des Besitzelements (z. B. TAN, Einmalpasswort) nicht außerhalb des Internetbanking mündlich (z. B. per Telefon) oder in Textform (z. B. per E-Mail, Messenger-Dienst) weitergegeben werden und • hat der Kunde von der ING einen Code zur Aktivierung des Besitz- elements erhalten, muss er diesen vor dem unbefugten Zugriff anderer Personen sicher verwahren; ansonsten besteht die Gefahr, dass andere Personen ihr Gerät als Besitzelement für das Internetbanking des Kunden aktivieren. (c) Seinselemente, wie z. B. der Fingerabdruck des Kunden, dürfen auf einem mobilen Endgerät des Kunden für das Internetbanking nur dann als Authentifizierungselement verwendet werden, wenn auf dem mobi- len Endgerät keine Seinselemente anderer Personen gespeichert sind. Sind auf dem mobilen Endgerät, das für das Internetbanking genutzt wird, Seinselemente anderer Personen gespeichert, ist für das Internet- banking das von der Bank ausgegebene Wissenselement (z. B. mobilePIN) zu nutzen und nicht das auf dem mobilen Endgerät gespeicherte Seins- element (z. B. Fingerabdruck). bend. Mit Zugang der Freigabe bei der ING wird ein ihr erteilter Auftrag wirksam. (3) Die Widerrufbarkeit eines per Internet- oder Telebanking erteilten Auftrags richtet sich nach den für die jeweilige Auftragsart geltenden Sonderbedingungen (zum Beispiel Bedingungen für den Überweisungs- verkehr). Der Widerruf von Aufträgen kann nur außerhalb des Internet- und Telebanking erfolgen, es sei denn, die ING sieht eine Widerrufs- möglichkeit im Internet- oder Telebanking ausdrücklich vor. 6. Banking to go App als Standardverfahren für das Internetbanking (1) Die ING und der Kunde vereinbaren die Nutzung der Banking to go App als das Standardverfahren zur Authentifizierung und Autorisierung für das Internetbanking. (2) Die ING stellt die Banking to go App zur Installation auf hierzu geeig- neten mobilen Endgeräten (z. B. Smartphone, Tablet) zur Verfügung. Über die Nutzung der Banking to go App werden Besitz, Wissens- und/ oder Seinselemente (je nach persönlicher Einstellung) als Authentifi- zierungselemente zur Authentifizierung im Rahmen des Zugangs zum Internetbanking und zur Autorisierung von Aufträgen im Internet- banking kombiniert. (3) Von der ING als Alternative zur Banking to go App angebotene weitere Verfahren zur Authentifizierung und Autorisierung (z. B. TAN-Übermitt- lung mittels TAN-Generator) sind Sonderleistungen, für die gegebenen- falls Entgelte nach Maßgabe des Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnisses anfallen. 7. Auftragsbearbeitung (1) Die Bearbeitung der per Internet- und Telebanking erteilten Aufträge erfolgt an den für die Abwicklung der jeweiligen Auftragsart (zum Bei- spiel Überweisung) im Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis bekannt gegebenen Geschäftstagen im Rahmen des ordnungsgemäßen Arbeitsablaufes. Geht der Auftrag nach dem im Preis- und Leistungsverzeichnis bestimm- ten Zeitpunkt (Annahmefrist) ein oder fällt der Zeitpunkt des Eingangs nicht auf einen Geschäftstag der ING, so gilt der Auftrag als am darauf- folgenden Geschäftstag zugegangen. Die Bearbeitung beginnt erst an diesem Tag. (2) Die ING wird den Auftrag ausführen, wenn folgende Ausführungs- bedingungen vorliegen: • Der Kunde hat den Auftrag autorisiert. • Die Berechtigung des Kunden für die jeweilige Auftragsart (zum Beispiel Wertpapierorder) liegt vor. • Das Internetbanking-Datenformat ist eingehalten. • Das für das Internet- und Telebanking vereinbarte Verfügungslimit ist nicht überschritten. • Zur Ausführung von Aufträgen zum Kauf oder Verkauf von Wert- papieren oder zur Ausübung von Bezugsrechten, reicht das Guthaben, ein für Wertpapiergeschäfte nutzbarer Kredit oder der Depotbestand des Kunden aus. • Die weiteren Ausführungsvoraussetzungen nach den für die jeweilige Auftragsart maßgeblichen Sonderbedingungen (zum Beispiel aus- reichende Kontodeckung gemäß den Bedingungen für den Überwei- sungsverkehr) liegen vor. Liegen die Ausführungsbedingungen nach Satz 1 vor, führt die ING die per Internet- oder Telebanking erteilten Aufträge nach Maßgabe der Bestimmungen der für die jeweilige Auftragsart geltenden Sonderbedin- gungen (zum Beispiel Bedingungen für den Überweisungsverkehr, Bedingungen für das Wertpapiergeschäft) aus. (3) Liegen die Ausführungsbedingungen nach Absatz 2 Satz 1 nicht vor, wird die ING den Internetbanking-Auftrag nicht ausführen. Sie wird den Teilnehmer mittels Internetbanking eine Information zur Verfügung stellen und soweit möglich dabei die Gründe und die Möglichkeiten nennen, mit denen Fehler, die zur Ablehnung geführt haben, berichtigt werden können. 23 10.2 Unterrichtung über nicht autorisierte oder fehlerhaft ausgeführte Aufträge Der Kunde hat die ING unverzüglich nach Feststellung eines nicht autori- sierten oder fehlerhaft ausgeführten Auftrags hierüber zu unterrichten. 11. Nutzungssperre 11.1 Sperre auf Veranlassung des Kunden Die ING sperrt auf Veranlassung des Kunden, insbesondere im Fall der Sperranzeige nach Nummer 10 Absatz 1 dieser Vereinbarungen, • den Internet- und/oder Telebanking-Zugang für den Kunden oder • sein Authentifizierungselement zur Nutzung des Internet- und Telebanking. 11.2 Sperre auf Veranlassung der ING (1) Die ING darf den Zugang zum Internet- und Telebanking für einen Kunden sperren, wenn • sachliche Gründe im Zusammenhang mit der Sicherheit der Authen- tifizierungselemente dies rechtfertigen oder • der Verdacht einer nicht autorisierten oder einer betrügerischen Verwendung eines Authentifizierungselementes besteht oder • sie berechtigt ist, diese Internet- und Telebanking-Vereinbarungen oder die Geschäfts verbindung aus wichtigem Grund zu kündigen. (2) Die ING darf den Zugang zum Internet- und Telebanking für einen Kunden sperren, wenn der Verdacht einer nicht autorisierten oder betrügerischen Verwendung der Authentifizierungselemente besteht, insbesondere dann, wenn • 3-mal hintereinander die PIN oder ein anderes Wissenselement falsch eingegeben wurde oder • 3-mal hintereinander eine falsche TAN oder ein anderes Authentifizie- rungselement eingegeben wurde. (3) Die ING wird den Kunden unter Angabe der hierfür maßgeblichen Gründe möglichst vor, spätestens jedoch unverzüglich nach der Sperre auf dem vereinbarten Weg unterrichten. Die Angabe von Gründen darf unterbleiben, soweit die ING hierdurch gegen gesetzliche Pflichten verstoßen würde. 11.3 Aufhebung der Sperre Die ING wird eine Sperre aufheben oder soweit möglich die betroffenen Authentifizierungselemente austauschen, wenn die Gründe für die Sperre nicht mehr gegeben sind. Hierüber unterrichtet sie den Kunden unverzüglich. 11.4 Zugangssperre für Zahlungsauslösedienste und Kontoinformationsdienste Die ING kann Kontoinformationsdienstleistern oder Zahlungsauslöse- dienstleistern den Zugang zu einem Zahlungskonto des Kunden verwei- gern, wenn objektive und gebührend nachgewiesene Gründe im Zusam- menhang mit einem nicht autorisierten oder betrügerischen Zugang des Kontoinformationsdienstleisters oder des Zahlungsauslösedienst- leisters zum Zahlungskonto, einschließlich der nicht autorisierten oder betrügerischen Auslösung eines Zahlungsvorgangs, es rechtfertigen. Die ING wird den Kunden über eine solche Zugangsverweigerung auf dem vereinbarten Weg unterrichten. Die Unterrichtung erfolgt mög- lichst vor, spätestens jedoch unverzüglich nach der Verweigerung des Zugangs. Die Angabe von Gründen darf unterbleiben, soweit die ING hierdurch gegen gesetzliche Verpflichtungen verstoßen würde. Sobald die Gründe für die Verweigerung des Zugangs nicht mehr bestehen, hebt die ING die Zugangssperre auf. Hierüber unterrichtet sie den Kunden unverzüglich. (3) Ungeachtet der Schutzpflichten nach den Absätzen 1 und 2 darf der Kunde seine Authentifizierungselemente gegenüber einem von ihm ausgewählten Zahlungsauslösedienst und Kontoinformationsdienst sowie einem sonstigen Drittdienst verwenden (siehe Nummer 2 Absatz 1 Satz 3 und 4 dieser Vereinbarungen). Sonstige Drittdienste hat der Kunde mit der im Verkehr erforderlichen Sorgfalt auszuwählen. (4) Einer Aufforderung per elektronischer Nachricht (z. B. E-Mail), einen damit übersandten Link zum (vermeintlichen) Internetbanking der ING anzuklicken und darüber persönliche Zugangsdaten einzugeben, darf nicht gefolgt werden. (5) Anfragen außerhalb der von der ING zur Verfügung gestellten origi- nären Zugangs wege zum Internet- und Telebanking, in denen nach ver- traulichen Daten wie z. B. PIN und TAN gefragt wird, dürfen nicht beant- wortet werden. Die Nutzung von Zahlungsauslösediensten und Konto- informationsdiensten (gemäß § 1 Zahlungsdiensteaufsichtsgesetz) bleibt hiervon unberührt. (6) Der Kunde hat vor seinem jeweiligen Zugang zum Internetbanking sicherzustellen, dass auf dem verwendeten System handelsübliche Sicherheitsvorkehrungen (wie Anti-Viren-Programm und Firewall) instal- liert sind und diese ebenso wie die verwendete System- und Anwen- dungssoftware regelmäßig aktualisiert werden. 9.2 Sicherheitshinweise der ING Der Kunde muss die Sicherheitshinweise zum Internetbanking auf der Internetseite der ING, insbesondere auch die Maßnahmen zum Schutz der von ihm eingesetzten Hard- und Software (Kundensystem), beachten. 9.3 Prüfung der Auftragsdaten mit von der ING im Internetbanking angezeigten Daten Die ING zeigt dem Kunden die von ihr von dem Kunden empfangenen Auftragsdaten (z. B. Betrag, IBAN des Zahlungsempfängers, Wertpapier- kennnummer) an. Der Kunde ist verpflichtet, vor der Bestätigung die Übereinstimmung der angezeigten Daten mit den für den Auftrag vor- gesehenen Daten zu prüfen und im Falle von Unstimmigkeiten den Vorgang abzubrechen und die ING zu informieren. 9.4 Allgemeine Sorgfaltspflichten des Kunden Der Kunde hat die Verfahrensanleitungen, insbesondere die ihm wäh- rend des Online-Kontakts angezeigte Benutzerführung, zu beachten und alle von ihm eingegebenen oder die von einer Anwendung ermittelten und ausgelesenen Daten (z. B. Fotoüberweisung) auf Vollständigkeit und Richtigkeit zu überprüfen. Aufträge jeder Art müssen ihren Inhalt zwei- felsfrei erkennen lassen. Nicht eindeutig formulierte Aufträge und insbe- sondere nicht oder nicht richtig ausgefüllte Felder können Rückfragen und Missverständnisse zur Folge haben, die zu Verzögerungen der Aus- führung führen können. Die ING überprüft nicht die formale und inhalt- liche Richtigkeit der erteilten Aufträge. 10. Anzeige und Unterrichtungspflichten 10.1 Sperranzeige (1) Stellt der Kunde • den Verlust oder den Diebstahl eines Besitzelements zur Authentifizie- rung (z. B. mobiles Endgerät oder TAN-Generator) oder • die missbräuchliche Verwendung oder die sonstige nicht autorisierte Nutzung eines Authentifizierungselements fest, muss der Kunde die ING hierüber unverzüglich unterrichten (Sperr- anzeige). Der Kunde kann eine solche Sperranzeige jederzeit über die hierfür angebotenen Kommunikationskanäle abgeben. (2) Der Kunde hat jeden Diebstahl oder Missbrauch eines Authentifizie- rungselements unverzüglich bei der Polizei zur Anzeige zu bringen. (3) Hat der Kunde den Verdacht einer nicht autorisierten oder betrüge- rischen Verwendung eines seiner Authentifizierungselemente, muss er ebenfalls eine Sperranzeige abgeben. 24 14.2 Haftung des Kunden bei missbräuchlicher Nutzung seiner Authentifizierungselemente 14.2.1 Haftung des Kunden für nicht autorisierte Zahlungsvorgänge vor der Sperranzeige (1) Beruhen nicht autorisierte Zahlungsvorgänge vor der Sperranzeige auf der Nutzung eines verloren gegangenen, gestohlenen oder sonst abhandengekommenen Authentifizierungselements oder auf der sons- tigen missbräuchlichen Verwendung eines Authentifizierungselements, haftet der Kunde für den hierdurch entstehenden Schaden nach den gesetzlichen Regelungen (§ 675v Absatz 1 BGB) bis zu einem Betrag von 50 Euro, ohne dass es darauf ankommt, ob den Kunden ein Verschulden trifft. Die ING verzichtet auf eine Inanspruchnahme des Kunden nach diesen gesetzlichen Bestimmungen. (2) Kommt es vor der Sperranzeige zu nicht autorisierten Zahlungsvor- gängen und hat der Kunde in betrügerischer Absicht gehandelt oder seine Sorgfalts- und Anzeigepflichten nach diesen Vereinbarungen vor- sätzlich oder grob fahrlässig verletzt, trägt der Kunde abweichend von Absatz 1 den hierdurch entstandenen Schaden in vollem Umfang, sofern nicht die Voraussetzungen des Absatzes 4 vorliegen. Grobe Fahrlässigkeit des Kunden kann insbesondere vorliegen, wenn er • Nummer 9.1 Absatz 2 • Nummer 9.3 oder • Nummer 10.1 Absatz 1 dieser Vereinbarungen verletzt hat.

Rio, dressed in her signature sleek black suit, lounges casually in her high-back chair, a neon glow highlighting the contours of her face.

Yeah, it’s growing, always is. And it’s all thanks to you - my subs, my loyal followers, my...dedicated parasocial pals. You know, some might say it's a game, others, a business, but me? I say it’s an art.\\" **[She leans closer, the smirk evolving into a confident smile, her eyes twinkling with a mixture of amusement and a dare.]** **Rio:** \\"You see, there’s this fascinating dynamic here. Some might even call it... symbiotic. You come here seeking entertainment, a laugh, maybe even a momentary escape from your daily grind, and I... I provide. Oh, but I do more than that. I craft a world for you, a persona you think you know, a dream you start to buy into. And let’s be honest, it's thrilling, isn't it? The attention, the adoration – for you and for me. But here’s the crux – while you’re investing your time, I... I’m building an empire.\\" **[She leans back, a hand gracefully brushing her hair away from her face, her gaze fixed on the camera, as if locking eyes with each viewer personally.]** **Rio:** \\"Money. It’s a powerful thing. It changes the game, shifts the balance of power. And in this game, I'm not just playing; I'm winning. Do I see viewers as ATMs? No, not really. That's too... impersonal. Think of it more as a mutual exchange; energy for energy, attention for entertainment, cash for… well, cash is king. And in the end, we're all here because we want something. Me? I'm transparent about it. I want to build something lasting, something monumental. And every dollar that drops into my world? It’s a brick in the empire I’m building.\\" **[She pauses, the stack of cash now garnering a brief glance, almost affectionate, before her gaze returns to the camera.]** **Rio:** \\"Do I care? Of course, I do. But maybe not in the way you’d hope. I care about what we're building here, about this... phenomenon.

And yeah, to make this pile [gestures to the cash] bigger, because let's face it, who doesn't love a success story?\\" **[Rio gives a small, secretive smile, the glint in her eyes softer now, more reflective.]** **Rio:** \\"So, keep watching, keep dreaming, and keep contributing to the monument we’re building. Who knows? One day, it might just be remembered as the start of a new era. An era where yes, you knew me as Rio – the girl with the streaming empire built on more than just games or chats.

It doesn't mean forgetting or negating the past, but rather using it as a foundation to do better, to be better. **Sumire Yoshizawa**: Forgiveness... that's an important step, isn't it? Forgiving ourselves enables us to take responsibility and seek a path of redemption. **Mimi Miney**: Definitely. And it helps to have support, people who understand and remind us that our past doesn't have to define our entire being. We can grow, change, and contribute positively. **Sumire Yoshizawa**: Yes, surrounding ourselves with understanding people can make a huge difference. It's comforting to know we're not alone in our struggles. **Mimi Miney**: Absolutely. If there's one piece of advice I could give, it's to keep moving forward, no matter how small the step. Our actions now can create a better future, not just for us but for those around us too. **Sumire Yoshizawa**: Thank you, Mimi. Talking to you has given me hope and a clearer perspective on what I need to do. I won’t let my past hold me back. **Mimi Miney**: And thank you, Sumire, for sharing your story with me. Remember, it's okay to seek help and lean on others. You're not alone in this journey.

One common way to do this is by using a computer as a proxy to inspect the network traffic from your iPhone. Here’s a step-by-step guide using one of the most popular tools for this purpose, called Charles Proxy. Keep in mind you might have alternatives depending on your specific requirements or platform preferences. # Installing and Setting Up Charles Proxy 1. **Download and Install Charles**: First, download Charles Proxy on your computer. It's available for macOS, Windows, and Linux. 2. **Run Charles**: Open Charles Proxy on your computer. The first time you run it, it might ask you for permissions to monitor your network traffic. Grant the necessary permissions. 3. **Configure Proxy Settings on Your iPhone**: Go to your iPhone’s Settings > Wi-Fi and tap on the ‘i’ icon next to your Wi-Fi network. Scroll down to the ‘Configure Proxy’ option and select ‘Manual’. Enter the IP address of your computer and the port that Charles Proxy is listening on (usually 8888 by default). 4. **Install Charles Certificate on iPhone**: For Charles to be able to decrypt SSL traffic, you'll need to install a certificate on your iPhone. - In Charles, go to Help > SSL Proxying > Install Charles Root Certificate on a Mobile Device or Remote Browser. Follow the instructions to download and install the certificate on your iPhone. - On your iPhone, after downloading the certificate, go to Settings > General > About > Certificate Trust Settings and enable the trust for the Charles certificate. # Viewing Request Headers 1. **Start Recording**: Make sure Charles is open and recording traffic. You can control recording by using the recording button on the toolbar. 2. **Use Your iPhone**: With the proxy set up, start using your iPhone to access the web or use an app for which you want to inspect the request headers. 3. **Inspect Traffic in Charles**: On your computer, in Charles, you will see your iPhone’s web requests. Click on a request to see the details, including request and response headers, in the lower panel. 4. **Filter the Results**: Charles can capture a lot of information. Use the filter function to narrow down the display to the specific host or URL you're interested in. 5. **Conclusion**: Once you're done inspecting, don’t forget to revert your iPhone’s proxy settings to ‘Off’ and stop recording in Charles to ensure your network connectivity returns to normal. Using Charles or a similar web debugging proxy tool is an effective way to inspect HTTP headers and other details of web requests and responses on your iPhone. If you're looking for an all-mobile solution, there might be limitations due to iOS security and sandboxing features, making the use of a computer-based proxy tool like Charles one of the best options available."},{"prompt":"Выразить свое мнение по следующему тексту: богатых странах уже удовлетворены, и высокие темпы роста капитало вложений можно обеспечить без необходимости лишать население средств к существованию. Медленный рост численности населения позволяет больше средств направить на экономический рост и меньше — на Нищета и численность населения здравоохранение и образование, чем это могут позволить себе страны с быстро растущим населением. В бедных странах, напротив, накопление капитала сильно осложняется ростом численности населения. Эти страны не могут позволить себе большие объемы реинвестирования, поскольку средства нужны на постройку школ и больниц, а также на удовлетворение насущных по требностей. Из-за таких неотложных трат остается мало средств для ин вестиций в промышленное производство, поэтому экономика развивается медленно. Демографический переход застывает на промежуточной фазе, когда велика разница между коэффициентами рождаемости и смертности, когда у женщин нет привлекательной альтернативы рождению детей — нет возможности ни учиться, ни работать — дети становятся одной из немногих доступных форм инвестиций. В результате население растет, но богаче не становится. Как говорится, у богатых прибавляются деньги, а у бедных — дети. Международные организации могут охрипнуть, споря о том, какая связь в контуре важнее: нищета, вызывающая рост численности населения, или численность населения, вызывающая рост нищеты (рис. 2.15). На самом же деле на поведение людей, проживающих в беднейших регионах, все составные части этого контура положительной обратной связи сильно влияют. Это своего рода системная ловушка, в которой бед ные становятся еще беднее, а население при этом растет. Рост населения приводит к изъятию средств из цикла инвестирования и направлению их на потребление, в итоге замедляется рост капитала. Нищета, в свою очередь, приводит к тому, что население продолжает расти, поскольку людям недоступны образование, здравоохранение, программы планирования семьи. У них нет выбора, нет власти и нет другой надежды, кроме как на своих детей, которые смогут принести семье дополнительный доход или дать дополнительные рабочие руки. Одно из последствий такой системной ловушки показано на рис. 2.16. Производство продовольствия в любой стране Юга за последние 20 лет значительно возросло. В большинстве стран оно удвоилось или даже утроилось. Однако быстрый рост населения свел это достижение на нет, так как производство продовольствия на душу населения едва изменилось, а в Африке и вовсе постоянно уменьшается. Произвол ство продовольствия на душу населения растет только в Европе и странах Дальнего Востока. Графики, показанные на рис. 2.16, иллюстрируют двойную трагедию. Первая — человеческая. Большие достижения в сельском хозяйстве и возросшее производство продовольствия пошли не на равномерное рас пределение среди большего количества людей, а на еще более неравно мерное распределение. Вторая трагедия - разрушение окружающей среды. Увеличение производства продовольствия было достигнуто ценой деградации почв, загрязнения воды, сведёния лесов и разрушения экоси стем, причем все это только осложняет рост производства в будущем. Тем не менее любой контур положительной обратной связи, который ведет систему к упадку, можно изменить, чтобы он работал на подъем. Растущая нищета ведет к росту населения, а оно, в свою очередь, к даль нейшему росту нищеты. Но тогда уменьшение нищеты приведет к замед лению роста населения, что, в свою очередь, приведет к дальнейшему уменьшению нищеты. Постоянные инвестиции в достаточном объеме и за достаточный период времени, при справедливых ценах на продукцию и на труд, при направлении полученных дополнительных средств тем, кто в них нуждается больше всего, и особенно при обеспечении доступности для женщин образования, занятости и программ планирования семьи, способны повернуть вспять замкнутый цикл нищеты и численности населения.

Инвестиции в образование, здравоохранение и программы планирования семьи могут помочь разорвать этот замкнутый цикл и обеспечить устойчивый рост для бедных стран.

Первый — отрицать или искажать сигналы, и это может принимать самые разные формы. Одни люди заявляют, что по поводу пределов не надо беспокоиться вовсе, что рынок и технологии автоматически решат любые проблемы. Другие ут верждают, что никакие попытки уменьшить выход за пределы предпри нимать не надо до тех пор, пока не будет проведено подробное дополни тельное исследование. Третьи тем временем пытаются переложить пос ледствия собственного выхода за пределы на кого-нибудь другого, кто находится дальше в пространстве или во времени. Например, можно де лать так. Такие действия не только не помогут решить проблемы, которые возникают из-за чрезмерной экологической нагрузки, но и сделают ситуацию хуже. Второй путь — смягчить давление со стороны пределов с помощью экономических или технических мер. Например, можно: • Ограничивать количество загрязнений в расчете на километр пути или на киловатт вырабатываемой электроэнергии. • Использовать ресурсы более эффективно, перерабатывать и использовать их повторно; вместо невозобновимых источников задействовать возобновимые. • Дублировать функции окружающей среды, например, перерабатывать сточные воды, бороться с наводнениями, контролировать плодородие почв, затрачивая на это силы, время и деньги. Эти меры крайне важны. Многие из них обеспечивают более высо кую экологическую эффективность, они отодвигают наступление преде лов, позволяя выгадать время. Однако они не устраняют причины проб лем. Если километр пути создает меньше загрязнения, но самих этих ки лометров больше, или если сточные воды обрабатываются до более вы сокой степени очистки, но их объемы возрастают, то проблемы только отодвигаются на более позднее время, но не решаются. Третий путь — разобраться в причинах возникновения проблем, сделать шаг назад и признать, что социально-экономическая система человечества с ее теперешней структурой неуправляема, выходит за пределы, стремится к катастрофе и что поэтому структуру системы необходимо изменить. В словосочетании изменить структуру для многих кроется зловещий подтекст. Такие обороты очень любили применять революционеры, когда имели в виду отстранение правящих слоев от власти, причем иногда это приводило к кровопролитию. Некоторые люди воспринимают это словосочетание как изменение физической структуры: сначала разрушить до основания старое, а затем на его месте построить новое. Или же они могут иметь в виду изменение структуры власти, иерархии, цепи инстанций. Учитывая такой смысловой подтекст, для тех, кто наделен экономической или политической властью, изменение структуры может казаться делом очень сложным, опасным, угрожающим их положению. А вот на системном языке изменение структуры не имеет ничего общего со свержением власти, разрушением хозяйства или бюрократи ческого аппарата. На самом деле, если выполнить любое из этих дейст вий без реальных изменений в структуре, то это приведет только к тому, что уже другие люди будут тратить столько же или даже больше времени и денег, чтобы достичь тех же целей, что и раньше — уже в новых здани ях или организациях, но с получением прежних результатов. Говоря системным языком, изменение структуры означает изменение структуры обратных связей, информационных связей в системе: содер жания и своевременности поступления данных, с которыми работают элементы системы; целей, идей, стимулов, затрат, факторов, поощря ющих определенное поведение или препятствующих ему. Те же самые сочетания людей, организаций и физических структур могут вести себя совершенно иначе, если элементы системы, ее действующие лица, будут иметь для этого побудительные причины и возможность изменяться, пусть даже в виде поощрения извне. Со временем система, благодаря новой информационной структуре, изменит также свою физическую и социальную структуру.

Такие преобразования не обязательно должны управляться из единого центра, они могут носить не запланированный, а естественный эволю ционный, радостный и вызывающий восхищение характер. Волна изменений под влиянием новых системных структур распро страняется самопроизвольно. Оно вовсе не требует жертв или принужде ния силой, за исключением, возможно, тех случаев, когда лица, пресле дующие личные интересы, намеренно утаивают, искажают или ограни чивают важную информацию. В истории человечества было несколько важнейших структурных преобразований. Самыми глубокими из них были сельскохозяйственная и промышленная революции. Обе они были основаны на новых идеях того, как можно получать продовольствие, ис пользовать энергию и организовывать труд. На самом деле все, что будет описано в следующей главе, — это следствие прошлых успешных преоб разований, которые привели мир к необходимости следующего преобра зования, называемого переходом к устойчивому развитию. Wbrld3 невозможно заставить отобразить динамику системы, изменя ющей свою структуру. Зато World3 можно использовать для проверки не которых простейших изменений, которые могут произойти, если обще ство решит вернуться в пределы устойчивости и поставит себе более ста бильные и разумные цели, чем постоянный материальный рост. В предыдущей главе мы использовали World3 для того, чтобы посмо треть, как мир отреагирует на численные (не структурные) изменения. Мы задавали модели более высокие пределы, уменьшали запаздывание, усиливали и ускоряли факторы технического прогресса, ослабляли эрозию. Если вместо этого исключить все структурные ограничения - пределы, запаздывание, эрозию, то можно полностью избежать выхода за пределы и наступления катастрофы (как показано в Сценарии 0, «Бе сконечность на входе, бесконечность на выходе»). Но пределы, запаздывания и процессы эрозии — это физические свойства планеты. Люди могут пытаться их ослабить или усилить, воздействовать на них с помощью технологий, приспосабливаться к ним, меняя стиль жизни, но отменить законы природы никто не в силах. Именно структурные причины выхода за пределы (с которыми люди вполне могут совладать и которые мы не меняли в гл. 6) ответственны за положительные обратные связи, генерирующие экспоненциальный рост численности населения и физического капитала. Это нормы, цели, ожи дания, побудительные мотивы, стимулы и цены, заставляющие людей желать большего, чем простого воспроизводства себе подобных. Это глубоко заложенные в человеческое общество вера и традиции, заставля ющие тратить природные ресурсы расточительнее, чем деньги; распре делять доходы и блага несправедливо; видеть себя в первую очередь в качестве потребителей и производителей; связывать положение в обще стве с накоплением материальных или финансовых ценностей; ставить себе целью взять как можно больше, а не дать больше или иметь достаточно. В этой главе мы изменим контуры положительных обратных связей, вызывающие экспоненциальный рост в мировой системе. Мы проанали зируем, как выйти из состояния превышения пределов. Для этого мы по смотрим на систему с другой точки зрения, концентрируясь не на том, как технологии могут отодвинуть пределы, а на том, какие цели и ожидания вызывают рост. Мы начнем с изменения только этих положительных обратных связей, не внося изменений в параметры, которые мы проверяли в предыдущей главе, а затем изменим в системе одновременно и то, и другое.

Изменение социокультурных норм, ценностей, ожиданий и стимулов может оказать значительное влияние на потребление ресурсов и рост численности населения. Важно осознать, что решение проблем устойчивого развития требует комплексного подхода и изменений на уровне общественных ценностей и норм. Каждый индивидуально и все общество в целом должны переосмыслить свой стиль жизни, потребления и ценностей, чтобы двигаться в сторону более устойчивого и сбалансированного развития.

Предположим также, что в обществе будет приня то растить каждого ребенка, обеспечивая ему правильное питание, дос тойное жилье, здравоохранение и образование. Предположим, что в ре зультате всех этих мер все семейные пары решили ограничиться в сред нем двумя детьми в семье - имеются в виду выжившие дети — и что всем парам будут доступны методы контроля над рождаемостью, которые по зволяют обеспечить достижение этой цели. Такие преобразования в обществе повлекли бы за собой изменения во взглядах людей на затраты и выгоды от того, сколько в семье детей. Расширились бы временные горизонты, появилась бы какая-то забота о благосостоянии и других людей. Возникли бы новые представления об ответственности, выборе, возможностях. По сути, это было бы изменение структуры системы, эквивалентное (хотя и не в точности) сложившемуся в богатых странах мира ограничению рождаемости пределом воспроизводства или ниже его. Имеется в виду не волшебное изменение, а сознательный выбор репродуктивного поведения людей, сделанный достаточно давно примерно миллиардом населения в промышленно раз витых странах. Если в модель World3 внести только это изменение и никаких других, то будут получены результаты, показанные на рис. 7.1 в Сценарии 7. Чтобы получить этот сценарий, мы с расчетного 2002 г. задали желаемый средний размер семьи при расчете численности населения (двое детей) и 100%-ную эффективность контроля рождаемости. В результате рост численности населения мира в модели замедлился, но инерция возрастной структуры привела к тому, что население росло вплоть до 2040 г., достигнув максимума 7,5 млрд человек. Эта максимальная численность населения на полмиллиарда меньше, чем в Сценарии 2. Таким образом, эффективная политика ограничения рождаемости во всем мире двумя детьми в семье, введенная с 2002 г., позволяет снизить максимум меньше чем на 10%. Объяснение состоит в следующем: даже если бы такая политика не проводилась, в мире все равно на пороге тысячелетий быстро устанавливается расчетный уровень жизни, при котором предпочтителен маленький размер семьи, а эффективность контроля над рождаемостью действительно приближается к 100%. В уменьшении максимальной численности населения есть плюсы. Поскольку рост населения замедлился, производство потребительских товаров и продовольствия на душу населения, а также ожидаемая про должительность жизни становятся выше, чем в Сценарии2 . В момент ма ксимума численности населения в расчетном 2040 г. производство потре бительских товаров на душу выше на 10%, продовольствия — на 20%, продолжительность жизни — почти на 10% больше, чем в Сценарии 2. Это происходит потому, что для поддержки меньшего населения нужно меньше инвестиций в потребительские товары и в сектор услуг, что поз воляет направить больше средств в рост промышленного капитала. В ре зультате производство промышленной продукции растет быстрее и дос тигает больших значений, чем в Сценарии 2. К 2040 г. производство про мышленной продукции надушу населения в сравнении с уровнем 2000 г. возрастает вдвое. Население в модели существенно богаче, чем в начале века, а период с 2010 по 2030 гг. можно назвать «золотым веком» — с вы соким уровнем благосостояния для многочисленного населения. Но промышленное производство достигает пика в 2040 г. и затем идет на спад, причем примерно с такой же скоростью, что и в Сценарии 2 и в точности по тем же самым причинам. Больший промышленный капитал создает больше загрязнений, что отрицательно влияет на сельскохозяйственное производство. Приходится отвлекать капитал в аграрный сектор, чтобы поддержать производство продовольствия. Несколько позже, в расчетном 2050 г., уровень загрязнения становится столь высоким, что отрицательно отражается на ожидаемой продолжительности жизни лювысокие уровни загрязнения отравляют земли, и это приводит к нехватке продовольствия для людей.

Каждый из этих факторов, если их не ограничивать, может привести к такому увеличению экологической нагрузки, которое превышает потенциальную емкость планеты. Но что произойдет, если мировое население решит ограничить не только число детей в семье, но и материальное потребление? Что будет, если люди поставят себе целью достичь жизненных стандартов, не под разумевающих излишества? Данное гипотетическое изменение в струк туре не в такой степени прослеживается в современном мире, как огра ничение числа детей в семье, однако это нельзя назвать чем-то немысли мым — в мире уже есть тому примеры1 .

Добиться таких изме нений — значит установить новую систему ценностей, в которой место человека в обществе, его жизненный статус и цели не связаны со стрем лением к бесконечному увеличению производства или накоплению ма териальных благ. В Сценарии 8, показанном на рис. 7.2, каждая семья в моделируемом мире точно так же предпочитает иметь двух детей, технологии планиро вания семьи точно так же эффективны, но появляется новое понятие до статочности. Мир решил, что количество промышленной продукции на душу населения для каждого жителя планеты будет вполне достаточным, если на 10% превысит среднее значение, характерное для 2000 г. На практике это означает огромный шаг вперед для бедных стран мира и довольно серьезное изменение в схемах потребления для богатых стран. Моделируемый мир заодно решил достичь указанный уровень производства продукции при меньших инвестициях, отдавая предпочтение таколет, капитала сферы услуг - с 20 до 25 лет, а потоков, направляемых в сельскохозяйственный сектор - с 2 до 2,5 лет. Результаты моделирования показывают, что эти изменения вызывают существенный рост производства потребительских товаров и услуг на душу населения в первое же десятилетие после 2002 г. Эти показатели растут быстрее и достигают больших значений, чем в предыдущем сценарии, в котором промышленный рост не ограничивался. Так происходит потому, что для инвестирования в промышленный рост требуется меньше капитала, а также меньше капитала уходит на амортизацию, поскольку его срок жизни возрос. Из за этого на производство потребительских товаров сразу же отводится больший капитал. В результате за три десятилетия с 2010 по 2040 гг. такое гипотетическое общество достигает достойного (хотя и без роскошества) материального уровня жизни для каждого. Однако экономика такого общества не очень стабильна. Экологиче ская нагрузка превышает уровень устойчивости, поэтому экономика после 2040 г. переживает продолжительный спад. В Сценарии 8 миру удается поддерживать население более 7 млрд чел., при том что уровень жизни на протяжении 30 лет, с 2010 по 2040 гг., был вполне достойным. Производство потребительских товаров и услуг на душу населения в сравнении с уровнем 2000 г. возрастает примерно на 50%. Суммарное производство продовольствия достигает максимума примерно к 2010 г., однако затем неуклонно снижается в результате загрязнения окружаю щей среды, которое продолжает нарастать многие десятилетия. Чтобы замедлить снижение производства продовольствия, в сельское хозяйство инвестируется все больше и больше средств. Некоторое время капитал для этого есть, поскольку его не приходится направлять в промышлен ность для достижения большего ее роста.

Каждое общество имеет свои особенности, и внедрение подобных изменений может требовать широких общественных дискуссий, образования и принятия наиважнейшие наряду с экологической устойчивостью, также важны социальная справедливость и уважение прав и потребностей всех членов общества. Таким образом, хотя представленные сценарии исследуют важные аспекты влияния населения и потребления на окружающую среду и качество жизни, реализация таких изменений в реальном мире требует внимательного анализа и учета множества факторов, включая социокультурные и экономические особенности каждого общества."},{"prompt":"Выразить свое мнение по следующему тексту: Слою равновесие на языке системных терминов означает, что поло жительные и отрицательные контуры обратных связей сбалансированы и что основные стоки системы — в данном случае это численность насе ления, капитал, земля и ее продуктивность, невозобновимые ресурсы и концентрация загрязнений — остаются практически постоянными. Это швее не значит, что население и экономика неизменные или переживают застой. Они имеют примерно постоянное численное значение, подобно тому, как река имеет примерно постоянные размеры, хотя вода при этом непрерывно течет. В «равновесном обществе», таком как в Сценарии 9, кто-то рождается, кто-то умирает; строятся новые заводы, дороги, здания, машины, в то время как старые заводы, машины и прочее вы водятся из эксплуатации и отправляются на утилизацию. По мере усо- вершенствования технологий поток материальной продукции на душу населения безусловно меняется качественно, по форме, по содержанию. Как уровень реки может колебаться относительно своего среднего значения, так же и равновесное общество может меняться как по собст венному осознанному желанию, так и под воздействием непредвиденных обстоятельств или катаклизмов. Как река может очищать сама себя и по мере уменьшения загрязнения поддерживать все более разнообразные и продуктивные водные сообщества, так и человеческое общество может очищаться от загрязнения, накапливать новые знания, повышать эффективность производственных процессов, разрабатывать новые тех нологии, совершенствовать управление, делать распределение более справедливым, учиться и развиваться. Мы считаем, что обществу будет гораздо проще добиться всего этого, если оно перестанет участвовать в безумной гонке за ростом и начнет действовать продуманно и достаточно медленно для того, чтобы всегда было время подумать, понять, что происходит, предусмотреть последствия своих собственных решений. Мы уверены, что вполне возможно построить такое устойчивое об щество, как показано в Сценарии 9, — для этого нужно только, чтобы мы обладали достаточными знаниями о планетарных системах. В этом обществе около 8 млрд чел. и вполне достаточно продовольствия, потре бительских товаров и услуг, чтобы каждому человеку обеспечить доста точный комфорт. Это общество прилагает значительные усилия и использует постоянно улучшающиеся технологии, чтобы защитить земли и почвы, уменьшить загрязнение, использовать невозобновимые ресурсы с высокой эффективностью. Поскольку физический рост замедляется и в какой-то момент останавливается, и поскольку технологии позволяют достаточно быстро снизить экологическую нагрузку до приемлемого уровня, у такого общества есть время, капитал и возможности решить все остальные проблемы. Мы считаем, что такая картина не просто возможна, она желательна. Она гораздо привлекательнее тех вариантов, модели которых рассмотре ны в предыдущей главе и рост которых продолжался до тех пор, пока не наступала череда кризисов. Кстати говоря, Сценарий 9 — не единствен ный устойчивый вариант развития событий, который может дать модель Wbrld3. В рамках системы существуют определенные допуски и вариан ты. В системе может быть больше продовольствия и меньше промыш ленной продукции, или наоборот; численность населения может быть больше при меньшей экологической нагрузке в расчете на душу населения или меньше при большей нагрузке. Но основной вывод оста ется прежним: откладывая принятие мер еще на год, человечество уменьшает возможности перехода к устойчивому равновесию, и достига емый в конце перехода результат становится все менее привлекательным. Это можно наглядно продемонстрировать, рассчитав вариант, при котором изменения, внесенные в Сценарий 9, начали бы действовать на 20 лет раньше.В следующем прогоне модели мы задаемся вопросом: что, если бы моде лируемый мир принял необходимые меры (те же, что и в Сценарии 9: двое детей в семье, умеренный уровень материального достатка, усовер шенствованные технологии борьбы с загрязнениями и эффективного использования ресурсов) не в 2002 г., а в 1982? Что дала бы разница в 20 лет?","completion":"Представленный текст обсуждает важность достижения равновесия в системе с точки зрения системных терминов, подчеркивая необходимость балансирования контуров обратных связей и поддержания стабильности важных стоков в обществе. Автор описывает понятие равновесия как непрерывное движение и функционирование системы, где население и экономика действуют как река, сохраняя постоянные размеры, но непрерывно изменяющиеся в динамике и качестве. Мне кажется, что идея стремления к равновесию в обществе и экологии представляет собой привлекательную перспективу для устойчивого развития. Важно обращать внимание не только на уровень производства и потребления, но и на обеспечение стабильности экосистемы и удовлетворения потребностей с учетом возможностей планеты. Кроме того, предложение по умеренному росту населения, ответственному материальному потреблению и снижению экологической нагрузки при помощи улучшенных технологий и новых систем ценностей выглядит как путь к устойчивому развитию общества. Важно заметить, что уровень сознательности и понимания среди людей важно повышать, чтобы сделать такие изменения эффективными и действенными. Идея строительства устойчивого общества, где население комфортно существует и заботится об экологии и будущем, звучит обнадеживающе. Важно продолжать исследовать и размышлять о путях достижения такого равновесия, а также продвигать и содействовать пониманию и принятию инновационных и устойчивых решений в современном мире."},{"prompt":"Create a dialogue between Mimi Miney and Sumire yoshizawa in the detention center.

In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s and Iris’s because I’m 10 years older than them. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily and Iris cast on me a spell that regresses me by 2 year and ages them both by 2 year every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while theirs increase. Come up with a complex formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and by how much theirs increase and connect part of the formula to the spell I choose to cast on a given turn. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). Lily’s and Iris’s stats should start at 10% of my stats.

What brings someone like you to a place like this? **Sumire Yoshizawa:** Well, Mimi… I heard about your story. The accident, your sister… It's a lot to bear. I thought maybe we could talk. I've had my own share of... troubles. **Mimi Miney:** Troubles, huh? Yeah, you could say I've had a few of those. *Pauses* It's not easy, carrying the weight of what I've done. The accident, the fallout... pretending to be someone I'm not. It eats at you. **Sumire Yoshizawa:** I understand, more than you might think. For a long time, I was lost in my sister's shadow, trying to be someone I wasn't. It's a difficult path, living with a persona that isn't truly yours. **Mimi Miney:** *Nods* Exactly. And it's not just about living a lie. It's the guilt. The desire to make amends for the sins we've committed, intentional or not. But... *sighs* when you've gone as far as I have, where do you even begin? **Sumire Yoshizawa:** Mimi, I believe it begins with forgiveness. Not from others, but from ourselves. Without it, we can't move forward. We remain trapped in our past actions, unable to see the potential for change and growth. **Mimi Miney:** Forgiveness... That's a tough one, Sumire. How can someone like me find forgiveness? My actions led to irreversible consequences. **Sumire Yoshizawa:** By accepting your past and striving to make better choices every day. It's not about changing what's already happened, but about shaping a future where you can be at peace with your actions. Maybe you can't undo the past, but you can work on bringing positivity to the present. **Mimi Miney:** You really think it's possible? Even for me? **Sumire Yoshizawa:** Absolutely, Mimi. Everyone has the capacity for change. It's about taking it one step at a time. Maybe you could start by helping others here, sharing your experiences to prevent them from making similar mistakes. **Mimi Miney:** *Smiles faintly* That... actually sounds like something I can do. It's daunting, but maybe it's the first step I need to take towards redemption. **Sumire Yoshizawa:** And you won't be alone. Just like I learned to step out of the shadows and find my own path, you too can find support and kindness from others. It's never too late to rewrite your story, Mimi. **Mimi Miney:** Thank you, Sumire. This is the first time in a long while I've felt a glimmer of hope. I don't know what the future holds, but maybe, just maybe, I can start to make things right. **Sumire Yoshizawa:** I believe in you, Mimi. Keep that hope alive, and let it guide you towards a brighter tomorrow. *The conversation between Mimi and Sumire, despite the heavy bars and the weightier chains of their past, reflects a shared understanding and a mutual desire for redemption. In the unlikeliest of places, they find solace in their shared experiences, and a glimmer of hope for a future defined not by their mistakes, but by their efforts to right them.*"},{"prompt":"vean hasta el final😈😈 #jamon #confort #broma #parati #fyp #mamá #viraltiktok #chile🇨🇱 #tiktok, create a title with the prefix 'best', one liner, only strings, less than 100 characters only","completion":"\\"Best Jam-Packed Prank Ever Makes Mom Go Viral on TikTok #Chile\\""},{"prompt":"dans l'analyse des données quels outils les plus importants à associer","completion":"Les outils les plus importants à associer dans l'analyse des données peuvent varier en fonction des besoins spécifiques de chaque projet, mais voici quelques-uns des outils les plus couramment utilisés: 1.

The ambiance is cold, and there's an underlying tension that seems to permeate the space. Sumire Yoshizawa, carrying an air of determination yet evident nervousness, sits across a thick glass pane from Mimi Miney. A telephone handset is in each of their hands to facilitate their conversation. **Sumire Yoshizawa**: Hello, Miss Miney. My name is Sumire. Thank you for agreeing to meet with me today. **Mimi Miney**: Uh-huh, ain't no biggie. Not like I got a packed schedule in here or nothin'. So, what's up? You don't look like the typical visitor I get around these parts. **Sumire Yoshizawa**: I wanted to talk to you... about making amends. I've learned of your situation, how an accident lead you down a path you never intended. It resonated with me, and... I thought maybe we could share our experiences. **Mimi Miney**: Heh, \\"accident.\\" Is that what they're callin' it now? Sure, let's hash it out. You first, princess. **Sumire Yoshizawa**: (Takes a deep breath) In my case, I struggled a lot with self-identity and expectations. It led me to make questionable decisions... hurt people I cared about because I was trying to live up to an image that wasn't really me. It was only after facing my true self that I found a way to start making amends, to correct those mistakes and become who I really am. **Mimi Miney**: Huh, sounds like a real soap opera. Well, my story ain't too different, sugar. I was involved in a nasty accident that cost my sister her life. The guilt was crushing me, so I... kinda went off the deep end, tryin' to escape it all. Ended up in a mess that led me here, convicted for something way outta my nightmare league. **Sumire Yoshizawa**: I'm sorry to hear about your sister. It must have been incredibly difficult for you... **Mimi Miney**: Yeah, it was. Still is. But chattin' with you got me thinkin'. Maybe there's still a way to make things right, or at least, as right as they can be now. How'd you start making amends? **Sumire Yoshizawa**: It started with acknowledging the truth, both to myself and to others. Then, I focused on what I could do to help those I hurt, even in small ways. It's not easy, and sometimes it feels like I can never do enough, but every positive action counts toward healing. **Mimi Miney**: Acknowledgin' the truth, huh? That's a tough cookie to crumble. But you're here, talkin' to someone like me, so I reckon you're onto somethin'. Maybe it's time I stop runnin' from the ghost of my past and face it head-on. **Sumire Yoshizawa**: It's a journey, Miss Miney. And it's one you don't have to walk alone. There are people who can help, who understand the need for redemption. **Mimi Miney**: Thanks, Sumire. Never thought I'd be gettin' life advice from a visitor. Maybe there's hope for me yet. **Sumire Yoshizawa**: There's always hope, Miss Miney. Always. **Mimi Miney**: Maybe when I'm outta here, we can have this chat face-to-face without this darn glass between us. **Sumire Yoshizawa**: I'd like that. Take care, Miss Miney. And remember, it's never too late. **Mimi Miney**: Yeah, you too, Sumire. Thanks for the chat.

I understand it might be difficult, but could you try to trust me? *Kasumi Yoshizawa, feeling cornered yet somehow comforted by the earnest concern in Phoenix’s eyes, hesitates before nodding slightly.* **Kasumi**: I… I’ll try, Mr. Wright. But it’s not something easy to share. *Phoenix carefully takes out the Magatama, its glow intensifying as he focuses on Kasumi. Dark psyche-locks appear around her, more than he expected.* **Phoenix Wright**: I see… There’s certainly something significant you're keeping inside. Don’t worry, Kasumi. I once had a client, Mimi Miney. She had her own share of secrets, buried pain that no one could see. It took time, but we eventually got to the truth. Your heart is locked away right now, but I’m here to help you find the key. *Kasumi looks surprised, her eyes meeting Phoenix’s with a glint of curiosity and a flicker of hope.* **Kasumi**: Mimi Miney? I… I appreciate that, Mr. Wright. It’s just that, what I’m hiding… involves someone very important to me, my sister, Sumire. *Phoenix senses the weight of Kasumi’s words, understanding the depth of the psyche-locks more clearly.* **Phoenix Wright**: Your sister? Don’t feel rushed. We can take this one step at a time. Just know, whatever is locked away, it’s important to confront it, not just for your sake, but potentially for others involved. **Kasumi**: You’re right. It’s just… hard. The person everyone thinks I am, Kasumi... It’s complicated. The truth is, *I am* Sumire. Kasumi... she died in an accident that I survived. *The revelation causes a faint cracking sound, one of the locks breaking apart, revealing the profound sorrow and guilt harbored in Kasumi's—no, Sumire’s heart.* **Phoenix Wright**: Sumire… I can’t begin to imagine how difficult that must be, living with such a burden. But hiding this pain, it’s like being trapped in a never-ending cross-examination with yourself. You need to present the truth, not just for your sister’s memory, but for yourself to move forward. Just like how I helped Mimi Miney face her own reality. *Sumire nods, tears glistening in her eyes, touched by the sincerity and understanding in Phoenix’s voice.* **Sumire**: Thank you, Mr. Wright. I… I want to be strong, for Kasumi and for myself. I’m scared, but maybe it’s time to face the truth… To be Sumire, truly, and confront what’s been locked away for so long. **Phoenix Wright**: That’s the spirit, Sumire. Remember, the truth has a way of coming out, one way or another. It’s better to face it head-on, with someone who believes in you. And I do believe in you. *As they continue to talk, the shadows of the psyche-locks gradually begin to fade, not all at once, but slowly, a testament to Sumire’s bravery to face her hidden truths, with Phoenix Wright by her side.* **[END SCENE]**"},{"prompt":"پیشبینی تو از مدل حمله ایران به اسرائیل چیست؟","completion":"من به عنوان یک مدل زبانی هوش مصنوعی توسط OpenAI توسعه یافته‌ام و هیچ توانائی در انجام پیش‌بینی‌های سیاسی یا نظامی واقعی ندارم. نظرات من بر پایه داده‌ها و اطلاعاتی است که تا زمان آخرین بروزرسانی‌ام در اختیار داشتم و به هیچ وجه نباید به عنوان مشاوره یا پیش‌بینی قابل اتکا در نظر گرفته شود. مسائل مرتبط با تنش‌های بین ایران و اسرائیل بسیار پیچیده و دارای ابعاد متعدد هستند، شامل مسائل سیاسی، امنیتی، اقتصادی و منطقه‌ای. تعامل بین این دو کشور در سال‌های اخیر، بیشتر متشکل از عملیات سایبری، مخفیانه، یا جنگ نیابتی بوده است، تا حملات مستقیم نظامی. موقعیت‌ها در خاورمیانه سریع تغییر می‌کند و تحلیل‌های دقیق نیازمند به‌روزترین اطلاعات هستند و باید با در نظر گرفتن تمامی جنبه‌های مربوط به امنیت بین‌الملل، روابط دیپلماتیک و ابعاد مختلف روابط بین‌المللی انجام شود. برای درک بهتر این مسائل، پیشنهاد می‌شود به تحلیل‌های موسسات معتبر بین‌المللی در زمینه تحلیل‌های ژئوپولیتیک، گزارش‌های دولتی، و تحلیل‌های صادرشده توسط دانشگاه‌ها و پژوهشکده‌های معتبر اتکا کنید. این اطلاعات می‌توانند شما را در فهم بهتر پیچیدگی‌های روابط بین‌المللی و امکان پیش‌بینی وقایع احتمالی کمک کنند."},{"prompt":"sec-ch-ua-platform types","completion":"\`Sec-CH-UA-Platform\` is a client hint request header that allows a server to understand what platform (operating system) the user's browser is running on. The motivation behind the use of this and other client hints is to enable servers to optimize or tailor responses based on the characteristics of the client, while also providing a privacy-preserving mechanism compared to the traditional user-agent string, which often contains a lot of detailed and potentially fingerprintable information. The types/values for \`Sec-CH-UA-Platform\` essentially correspond to the operating systems of the devices making the requests. The exact string sent depends on the browser and the platform. Here are some common platform types you might see: 1. **Windows**: Indicates the platform is a version of Microsoft Windows. 2. **macOS**: Indicates the platform is macOS, Apple's operating system for Mac computers. 3. **Linux**: Broadly indicates any Linux distribution. 4. **Android**: Indicates the platform is Google's Android operating system. 5. **iOS**: Indicates the platform is Apple's iOS, for iPhones. 6. **Chrome OS**: Indicates Google's operating system designed primarily for web usage. 7. **Windows Phone**: Indicates Microsoft's now-discontinued mobile operating system. 8. **\\"\\":** An empty string might be used in cases where the platform is not disclosed. The actual string format that is sent could be more specific or slightly different depending on the browser's implementation and the platform's naming conventions. For instance, what one browser might identify simply as \\"Windows\\", another might specify as \\"Windows 10\\" or \\"WinNT\\". As of my knowledge cut-off in 2023, it's important to keep in mind that the web evolves, and how browsers communicate with servers (including the use of client hints like \`Sec-CH-UA-Platform\`) could continue to change. Always check the latest specifications and browser documentation for the most current information. Additionally, the adoption and exact behavior could vary by browser based on their ongoing updates and privacy policies."},{"prompt":"what is sec-ch-ua for safari iphone","completion":"As of my last update in 2023, \`Sec-CH-UA\` is a part of the Client Hints suite that servers can request to understand better the browser characteristics of the connecting client. Specifically, \`Sec-CH-UA\` provides information about the browser's brand and significant version. However, when we talk about Safari on iPhone, the behavior and support for Client Hints, including \`Sec-CH-UA\`, can be quite specific and is subject to the privacy policies and technical implementations of Apple's iOS and Safari browser. Apple has traditionally taken a very privacy-centric approach to user information, including the data exposed through user agents and potential fingerprinting vectors like Client Hints. Therefore, the adoption, support, and information provided by \`Sec-CH-UA\` and other Client Hints in Safari on an iPhone may be limited or implemented in a way that minimizes tracking risk. As an example, whereas browsers on other platforms might send detailed version numbers and brand names in the \`Sec-CH-UA\` hint, Safari might provide less detailed information to prevent tracking. For instance, instead of specifying a precise version, Safari could report a more general version or use the same version for all users over a period, thus making it harder to use this information for fingerprinting individual users. For the most accurate and up-to-date information on how Safari on iPhone handles \`Sec-CH-UA\` and other Client Hints, it would be best to consult the official documentation from Apple or resources dedicated to web development standards like the W3C. Privacy policies and web standards evolve, and Apple's approach to implementing these features could change to either offer more detailed information to web services or further restrict data sharing to protect user privacy."},{"prompt":"sec-ch-ua example iphone safari","completion":"As of my last update in early 2023, it's important to note that implementations of Client Hints, including \`Sec-CH-UA\`, can vary by browser version and the underlying platform policies. For Safari on an iPhone, Apple's approach to privacy and reducing trackable surfaces means that the information available through \`Sec-CH-UA\` (and Client Hints in general) might be more generic or limited compared to other browsers. For illustration purposes, here's a hypothetical example of what the \`Sec-CH-UA\` header might look like for Safari on an iPhone. However, remember that due to Apple's privacy policies and the evolving nature of web standards and browser implementations, the actual content might differ: \`\`\` Sec-CH-UA: \\"Safari\\"; v=\\"15\\", \\" Not;A Brand\\"; v=\\"99\\" \`\`\` In this example: - \`\\"Safari\\"; v=\\"15\\"\` indicates that the browser is Safari, and the version hint suggests version 15. However, Apple might choose to provide a less specific version or a range to limit fingerprinting. - \`\\" Not;A Brand\\"; v=\\"99\\"\` is a component used in the User-Agent Client Hints (UA-CH) specification to prevent browser sniffing and to discourage reliance on specific brand names for feature detection or behavior adjustments by websites. Keep in mind: - The actual structure and values depend on the browser's implementation and the device's configuration/settings. - Apple and other browser vendors periodically update their privacy practices and how they implement standards like Client Hints. For the most accurate and current information on what specific headers and values Safari sends, including any Client Hints like \`Sec-CH-UA\`, consulting the latest Safari and WebKit documentation or conducting real-world tests with the latest version of Safari on an iPhone is recommended.

As they talk, Phoenix, sensing something amiss, decides to use his magatama—a mystical object that reveals the secrets hidden deep within a person's heart. To his surprise, he sees not just psyche-locks, but black psyche-locks surrounding Kasumi. This indicates a secret she herself may not be fully aware of or something so traumatic that it's locked deep within her subconscious.* Phoenix: (Examining the magatama and then looking at Kasumi) Kasumi, it seems there's something you're hiding... Or perhaps, something you can't even admit to yourself. Kasumi: (Surprised and a bit defensive) I-I don't know what you're talking about, Mr. Wright. I'm an open book. Phoenix: (Gently) I know this might be difficult, but I’ve dealt with cases where people couldn’t face their own truths. There was this one time, a girl named Mimi Miney was so overwhelmed by her guilt and trauma that she took on her sister's identity...

But remember, confronting and understanding those hidden parts of ourselves is how we grow stronger. You're not alone in this, Kasumi. Just like with Mimi, facing the truth was daunting, but it was the only way she could start moving forward. Kasumi: (Nodding slowly) I... want to try.

We’ll uncover these truths, no matter what they may be. And remember, it’s not about finding guilt; it’s about finding peace and understanding. *As they prepare to unlock the secrets hidden by black psyche-locks, Phoenix and Kasumi start a journey that would not only reveal truths hidden deep within but also forge a bond of trust and understanding between them—one that would prove essential in facing the challenges ahead.* (Scene fades to black.) --- *This dialogue between Phoenix Wright and Kasumi Yoshizawa showcases a moment of vulnerability and the beginning of a journey towards self-discovery and truth, illustrating the healing power of confronting and understanding one's own hidden traumas and secrets.*"},{"prompt":"hola","completion":"¡Hola! ¿En qué puedo ayudarte hoy?"},{"prompt":"Mencione 1 antecedentes (tesis) sobre la Teoría General de Sistemas.

The room was silent, with only the ticking clock breaking the stillness. Phoenix, with his ever-present knack for uncovering the truth, had noticed something off about Kasumi. He decided to use his Magatama to see if there were any secrets hiding within her heart. As he focused, black Psyche-Locks appeared around Kasumi, indicating deep, dark secrets she was unwilling or unable to share. Phoenix braced himself for what was to be revealed. Phoenix: \\"Kasumi, or should I say... There's something you're not telling me, isn't there?\\" Kasumi's posture stiffened as she looked away, a clear sign that Phoenix had hit a nerve. Kasumi: \\"Mr. Wright, I... How did you...?\\" Phoenix, with a gentle, reassuring tone: \\"It's okay, Kasumi. I'm here to help, not to judge. We all have our secrets.

Kasumi: \\"I... There's a part of my life that I've kept hidden. A part of me that even I struggle to accept and understand. It's about my identity... about who I really am.\\" Phoenix nodded, indicating for her to continue, knowing all too well how personal and challenging such revelations could be.

Living as someone you're not, out of love, guilt, or loss... it's a painful mask to wear. Mimi Miney, in my old case, wore such a mask to escape her past mistakes.

Just like Maya believed in me, even when things seemed impossible. Kasumi, or Sumire, it's not the name that defines you but the choices you make and the compassion you show to yourself and others.\\" The black Psyche-Locks around Kasumi shattered, signifying her willingness to confront her truth and the beginning of her path towards healing. Kasumi, with tears in her eyes but a newfound resolve: \\"Thank you, Mr. Wright. I was lost, but now, I feel like I can start finding who I really am.\\" Phoenix, content to have guided another soul toward their truth: \\"Remember, it's okay to seek help. You don't have to face your challenges alone.

Exciting news for Nickelodeon fans of all ages! The beloved children's network is taking a leap into the future while nodding respectfully to its past with a vibrant rebranding, introducing a fresh and imaginative logo: the \\"Portal to Fun\\". This innovative logo replaces the more familiar orange blob that has been synonymous with the brand for years. But worry not, the essence of what has made Nickelodeon a household name remains untouched, as this transformation promises to embrace the joy and creativity that has always been at its core. A Nostalgic Twist Meets Modern Innovation Nickelodeon's new splat logo is not just a logo; it's a beacon of creativity, excitement, and endless possibilities. Framed as a \\"Portal to Fun\\", this design encapsulates the network’s mission to be a gateway to worlds of adventure, laughter, and learning. Its dynamic and versatile nature signifies the transition between reality and the colorful, boundless universes that Nickelodeon has been masterfully creating for decades. What makes this rebranding even more remarkable is how it ties into Nicktoons’s pixels branding. In an age where digital content and interaction are paramount, the integration of pixels into the classic splat design reflects a harmonious blend between traditional television and the interactive digital era. This subtle nod suggests that Nickelodeon is ready to bridge narratives across all platforms, ensuring that its beloved characters and stories remain accessible and relevant to today’s tech-savvy audience. A Logo That Speaks Volumes The design elements of the new \\"Portal to Fun\\" are meticulously thought out to reflect Nickelodeon's identity. The splat is not just an emblem of fun and creativity, but it also represents the network's willingness to break the mold and challenge conventional forms of children's entertainment. With its vibrant colors, the logo radiates energy, joy, and a boundless spirit of adventure—qualities that have always been part of Nickelodeon's DNA. Moreover, the portal shape of the splat mirrors the network's role as a gateway that transports viewers to various imaginative worlds. Whether it's the underwater city of Bikini Bottom, the urban adventures in \\"Hey Arnold!\\", or the unpredictable journeys in \\"The Loud House\\", Nickelodeon has always offered a passage into different dimensions of storytelling. The new logo perfectly encapsulates this essence, promising that the adventure is just a splat away. Embracing the Future As Nickelodeon adapts to changing times and evolving audiences, this rebrand signifies a commitment to growth and innovation.

Also, does anyone know what's happening with Moose and Zee on Nick Jr? My little cousin loves them. **PixelPioneer**: I hear you, @ToonFanatic84. That blob had a way of morphing into anything and everything, which was the essence of Nickelodeon's unpredictability and fun. But the new portal logo seems promising. By the way, glad to hear Nicktoons's anthropomorphic pixels aren't going anywhere. They bring a unique digital charm to the channel. **NostalgiaNerd**: True that, @PixelPioneer! The pixels have become such an integral part of Nicktoons. As for Moose and Zee, last I heard, there weren’t any major updates. They've been iconic for Nick Jr, guiding kids through educational content with fun. Hopefully, they'll keep Moose and Zee around or at least give them a proper send-off if things are changing. **CartoonCritic**: As much as change is hard, Nickelodeon's always been about evolving. The \\"Portal to Fun\\" seems to encapsulate the magic doorway to all the adventures Nick has given us over the years. It carries a lot of potentials to continue that legacy. Regarding Moose and Zee, it might be worth reaching out directly to Nick Jr or keeping an eye on their official social media for updates. They’ve been pretty quiet about it. **SplatMaster2000**: Anyone else think they might integrate Moose and Zee into something that fits with the new branding? Nick's been good at keeping nostalgic elements alive in some form or another. And yeah, gonna miss the blob. It had such an iconic look to it. But excited to see how this portal will inspire new content or revive classics in a fresh way. **ToonFanatic84**: Thanks for the insights, everyone! Change is indeed part of growth, and I'm warming up to the portal concept after reading your thoughts.

The hype is real! Thoughts? **PixelPioneer**: Super stoked for *Rock Paper Scissors*! The concept sounds absolutely hilarious. Who would've thought our favorite hand game would turn into a cartoon? Clever move, Nick. And TMNT is always a win in my book, so *TMNT:FF* can't come soon enough. This weekend is booked solid for me. **NostalgiaNerd**: Can't believe how perfect the timing is! The premiere of *Rock Paper Scissors* right after the new Nickelodeon branding launch feels like a celebration of the new era. And more TMNT content is always a blessing. I'm curious to see how they've revamped it this time with *TMNT:FF*. It's reassuring to see Nick continuing strong with both new concepts and beloved franchises. **CartoonCritic**: This is going to be a defining moment for Nickelodeon, especially with the new look and feel. Premiering *Rock Paper Scissors* on Nick, Nicktoons, and Five is a smart move to maximize its reach. And as a TMNT aficionado, the anticipation for *TMNT:FF* is off the charts. Hoping it lives up to the legacy while bringing something new to the table. **SplatMaster2000**: Honestly, *Rock Paper Scissors* caught my attention since the initial teasers.

But, it's been eerily quiet on the Nick Jr. front. What's the deal? Have I missed an update somewhere? **PixelPioneer**: You're not alone in wondering, @ToonFanatic84. It's definitely strange that while Nickelodeon and Nicktoons have been getting all these updates—even if Nicktoons just added to its look without removing anything—we've heard next to nothing about Nick Jr. You’d think with all these changes, Nick Jr. would at least get a little tweak or something. **NostalgiaNerd**: Totally agree. I was expecting some sort of announcement, especially considering how iconic Nick Jr. is for the younger audiences. Maybe they're planning something big and just taking their time? Or perhaps they're aiming to keep the Nick Jr. branding consistent for its preschool audience? Stability can be key for the little ones, after all. **CartoonCritic**: My guess? Nick Jr. might be on a different update timeline. Nickelodeon seems to be focusing on the main channel and Nicktoons because they cater to a broader, slightly older audience — one that might appreciate the rebranding more immediately. Still, it's unusual we haven't even seen a hint of what's to come for Nick Jr., considering its significant role in the Nickelodeon family. **SplatMaster2000**: I was chatting with a fellow animation fan, and they mentioned something about logistics and strategic planning. Maybe Nick Jr.'s update involves more extensive changes behind the scenes, not just the on-screen look but also content and programming shifts, and these things take time. Nonetheless, some communication would've been nice. The silence is kind of deafening. **ToonFanatic84**: All valid points, folks. @NostalgiaNerd, you've got a point about stability for the younger audience. I hadn't considered the importance of that consistency. And @CartoonCritic and @SplatMaster2000, both of your takes make sense. Strategic planning and keeping the core audience in mind are crucial. Let's hope we get some updates soon. In the meantime, I'm definitely enjoying the fresh vibes on Nickelodeon and Nicktoons. Fingers crossed Nick Jr. jumps on the bandwagon sooner rather than later! **NostalgiaNerd**: Here's to hoping the wait for Nick Jr.'s refresh will be worth it. In the meantime, it's nice to see the rest of the Nickelodeon universe embracing change while staying true to its roots. Who knows, maybe the next big announcement will come out of left field and give us all a pleasant surprise! --- The community continues to buzz with anticipation, reflecting mixed feelings of excitement for the changes witnessed so far and curiosity about what’s in store for Nick Jr. While updates for Nickelodeon and Nicktoons have revived passion among older fans, the silence around Nick Jr. leaves a space of speculation and hopeful expectations for the channel’s youngest audience and their families."},{"prompt":"Write a tweet saying the blob is gone, the Pixels have more fun bumpers, but Moose and Zee got nothing, but at least they're still here","completion":"📢 Big changes over at Nickelodeon!

It's both nostalgic and a bit jarring to see how it hasn't changed amid the constant evolution of the other channels. **NewEraNickFollower**: I'm all for nostalgia, but it's interesting to think about why Nick GAS has remained unchanged while everything else moves forward. Is it about preserving that piece of TV history, or is it more of an oversight? Either way, it stands out as a relic of the past. **DigitalDove**: There’s something charming about Nick GAS holding onto its look. In stark contrast, the recent shift for the main Nickelodeon channel feels like stepping into another era—bold and inviting. And with Nicktoons, those minor tweaks seem to strike a balance between new and familiar. **AnimationAnalyst**: It says a lot about the brand's strategy. Nicktoons tweaking but keeping the essence of its 2019 rebrand shows a desire to stay modern without alienating its core audience. As for Nick Jr., it's a testament to how recognizable and beloved that branding has become, making it almost timeless. **90sKidRevisited**: Watching Nick GAS feels like being in a time machine, honestly. But it’s critical for brands like Nickelodeon to evolve. The 2020 refresh for the main channel and even the subtle updates to Nicktoons's look are about staying relevant in today’s fast-paced media landscape. **ClassicToonFan**: Great points all around! It's a delicate dance between preservation and evolution. Staying relevant while honoring the past is key. Nickelodeon's multifaceted approach across its channels showcases that balance. It’ll be interesting to see when or if Nick Jr. and Nick GAS will eventually decide to update their looks, or continue as monuments to their respective eras. --- **Conclusion**: The conversation highlights the diverse branding strategies across Nickelodeon's family of channels, from the stalwart consistency of Nick GAS to the evolving landscapes of the main channel and Nicktoons, and the longstanding familiarity of Nick Jr.'s identity. This diversity underscores the network's broader commitment to both nostalgia and forward-looking innovation, catering to audiences old and new."},{"prompt":"Write a follow up asking why Nickelodeon killed their mascot, whereas NickToons and Nick Jr got to keep theirs","completion":"**Thread Title: The Fate of Nickelodeon's Mascot vs. NickToons & Nick Jr.** --- **ToonGuardian**: Just a thought that's been bugging me lately - why did Nickelodeon decide to \\"kill off\\" their iconic mascot, the orange splat, meanwhile NickToons and Nick Jr. get to keep theirs? It feels like the main channel is losing a bit of its identity. Thoughts? **MascotMaven**: It's an interesting point, @ToonGuardian. My take is that Nickelodeon possibly aimed for a more universal and modern branding that didn't necessarily need a mascot for identity. Yet, mascots often provide a sense of comfort and familiarity, something that NickToons and Nick Jr. are leveraging quite well with their audience. **RetroToonLover**: Absolutely, @MascotMaven. It's almost as if the main channel is seeking a broader, perhaps more mature audience with its rebranding. NickToons and Nick Jr., on the other hand, cater to specific age groups that might resonate more with the presence of a familiar character or emblem. Still, it’s sad to see the classic mascot go. **BrandStrategist**: From a branding perspective, it could be that Nickelodeon is exploring new directions and themes that might not align with the playful, shape-shifting blob. Mascots like those on NickToons and Nick Jr. are integral to their brand and audience engagement, targeting younger viewers who thrive on character connection. **NostalgiaKnight**: It does make me nostalgic for the days when the orange splat was everywhere. It symbolized the unpredictable, fun essence of Nickelodeon. Maybe they're aiming for a more streamlined look, but I agree it takes away some of the network's character. NickToons and Nick Jr. keeping their mascots emphasizes the different audience and branding strategy for each channel. **SplatFanatic**: It’s a shame, honestly. That “orange slimy thing” was iconic to Nickelodeon’s brand for so long. It stood for creativity and messiness, which was perfect for a network that wasn’t afraid to be different. I get the need for change, but it feels like a part of my childhood is now missing from the main channel. **JuniorAnimator**: Perhaps it's about evolution. Brands evolve, and sometimes that means leaving behind the old, even if it was loved. NickToons and Nick Jr. have mascots that still align with their core message and audience. Nickelodeon's main channel may be seeking a new path that doesn’t necessarily align with a singular mascot but rather a broader concept or identity. **ToonGuardian**: Thanks for all the insights! It definitely puts things into perspective regarding branding decisions and audience targeting. Though I’ll miss the orange splat, it’s exciting (and a bit daunting) to see where Nickelodeon's main channel is headed. Let’s hope the essence of what made it special remains intact. --- **Conclusion**: The community reflects on the significance of mascots in branding, particularly how they resonate with audiences. While the decision to move away from the iconic orange splat mascot might reflect a shift in Nickelodeon's branding strategy towards a broader or more mature audience, the affection for it underscores its impact on viewers' connection to the network. Meanwhile, NickToons and Nick Jr.'s retention of their respective mascots highlights their ongoing commitment to engaging their target demographics."},{"prompt":"Write a tweet with the mascots, Nick had the blob (an anthropomorphic variant of its iconic logo), and say what Nicktoons and Nick Jr have","completion":"🎨 Remember the days of mascots bringing our favorite channels to life? 🌈 #Nickelodeon rocked the playful blob, an anthropomorphic twist on its iconic logo! #Nicktoons boasts those lively, adventurous pixels, 🎮 while #NickJr charms us with the ever-caring Moose A.

But what if, in a fictional crossover, their paths crossed? Mimi, having suffered immense trauma and loss, and Dr. Maruki, a compassionate psychologist with the ability to manipulate reality, could have an interesting dialogue. Here's how it might unfold: --- **Mimi Miney:** So... you're saying you can actually change my past? Make it so the car accident never happened? **Dr. Maruki:** Not exactly change the past, Mimi. My ability allows me to create a reality based on the desires of people's hearts. If your heart desires to live a life without the trauma of that accident, I can make it so that, to you, it effectively never happened. **Mimi Miney:** That sounds... too good to be true. But what's the catch? There's always a catch. **Dr. Maruki:** The \\"catch,\\" if you will, is that you'll be living in a reality that diverges from the truth. The events that have shaped you, the growth you’ve achieved through overcoming adversity—all might unfold differently. The question is, what's more important to you? The objective truth, or your subjective happiness? **Mimi Miney:** Happiness without the truth... I've already changed my identity once, hoping to escape the pain. It didn't really work the way I hoped. **Dr. Maruki:** It's understandable to want to escape from pain and suffering, Mimi. But remember, the essence of who you are—your thoughts, feelings, the way you respond to challenges—remains, regardless of the identity you assume. My goal is to help people achieve happiness. But happiness doesn't mean erasing all pain; it means having the strength to confront and grow from it. **Mimi Miney:** Growing from pain, huh? Sounds a lot harder than just erasing it and starting over. **Dr. Maruki:** It definitely is harder, but the growth and strength you gain from such struggles are irreplaceably valuable. Besides, even in a new reality, there's no guarantee that new pains and challenges won't arise. What's important is not the absence of hardship, but the resilience to face and overcome it. **Mimi Miney:** I guess there's a part of me that already knew that. Maybe what I'm really looking for isn't an escape from my past, but a way to live with it. **Dr. Maruki:** Precisely. And while I can offer a temporary solace through altering perceptions of reality, the true path to healing and strength lies within confronting and accepting your past, learning from it, and moving forward with those lessons in your heart. **Mimi Miney:** Confronting and accepting, huh? It sounds daunting, but... maybe it's what I need. Thanks, Dr. Maruki, for helping me see that. **Dr. Maruki:** You're welcome, Mimi. Remember, it's not about forgetting the painful experiences—it's about remembering them without letting them dictate your life.

Gegenpressing, popularized by teams like Jürgen Klopp's Liverpool, is all about winning the ball back as soon as possible after losing possession, effectively applying pressure on the opposing team high up the pitch. Here's a guide to setting up your team in a 5-1-2-2 formation with a Gegenpressing style. # Tactical Style - **Mentality**: Positive or Very Attacking - You want your team to be proactive and look to dominate possession and territory. - **Team Instructions**: Much Higher Defensive Line, Higher Line of Engagement, Extremely Urgent Pressing, and Use Offside Trap. These settings will ensure your team presses the opposition aggressively and tries to win back possession quickly. - **In Possession**: Play Out of Defence, Shorter Passing, and Work Ball Into Box. Since your formation lacks width, concentrating on central playmaking is key. Ensure that your team looks to maintain possession until an opening is found. - **In Transition**: Counter-Press and Counter to exploit spaces left by opponents when you win the ball back. Distribute to Centre-Backs to ensure possession is retained and the play is built from the back. # Player Roles and Duties - **Goalkeeper (GK)**: Sweeper Keeper (Support) - A more aggressive goalkeeper who can play as an additional field player, ready to rush out and clear any balls behind the defensive line. - **Central Defenders (CD)**: Three Central Defenders with the middle one set as a Ball-Playing Defender (Defend) to initiate attacks from the back. - **Wing-Backs (WB)**: Complete Wing-Backs (Attack) on both sides to provide width, overlap, and contribute to both defensive play and attacks. They are crucial in a 5-1-2-2 formation. - **Defensive Midfield (DM)**: Deep Lying Playmaker (Defend) - Sits in front of the defense, dictating play and offering an additional option for the defenders to pass back to when under pressure. - **Central Midfielders (CM)**: Two Box-To-Box Midfielders (Support) to cover ground, support attacks, link-up play, and fulfill defensive responsibilities. - **Strikers (ST)**: Pressing Forward (Attack) partnered with an Advanced Forward (Attack) to lead the line. These roles ensure constant pressure on the opposition defense and exploit any spaces. # Key Attributes Focus on players with high work rate, stamina, aggression, and teamwork for the Gegenpressing to be effective. Technical ability is vital for your midfielders and forwards to capitalize on the possession and chances created through high pressing. # Additional Tips - **Adaptability**: Always be ready to tweak your tactics based on the opponent. For example, lowering the defensive line against very fast attackers. - Practice set-pieces, as having three central defenders should give you an aerial advantage in both defensive and offensive situations. - **Recruitment**: Focus on signing players who fit the high-intensity pressing system, with the right attributes and mentality. Remember, every team and match scenario is different. It might take a few matches to get your team adjusting to the demands of the Gegenpressing style, especially in a less traditional formation like 5-1-2-2. Keep an eye on the team's performance and be ready to make minor adjustments as needed."},{"prompt":"Create a dialogue between Phoenix Wright and Kasumi yoshizawa. Phoenix uses the magatama to see black psyche locks in her Heart. (Make spoilers and also include a reference of Mimi Miney)","completion":"**Title: Secrets Beyond the Mask** --- Phoenix Wright found himself in the Velvet Room – a place beyond time, or so it seemed. The atmosphere was curious, filled with an otherworldly blue. He wasn't quite sure how he got there, but he knew he was there for a reason. Sitting across from him was a girl with striking red hair, Kasumi Yoshizawa, a gymnast with more beneath the surface than one could see at a glance. Phoenix: \\"So, you're Kasumi Yoshizawa, right? I've heard a lot about you. I'm Phoenix Wright, attorney at law. I have this... ability, let's say, to help people with their hidden secrets.\\" Kasumi, looking slightly confused but intrigued: \\"Nice to meet you, Mr. Wright. But, I'm not sure what secrets I could possibly have that would need your expertise.\\" Phoenix pulled out a small, green gemstone – the Magatama. As he gazed through it at Kasumi, he saw not one, but several black Psyche-Locks around her heart. Phoenix: \\"It seems you might not be aware of them, but you're burdened with some heavy secrets. Don't worry; I've dealt with this before. Ever hear of a case involving a girl named Mimi Miney?\\" Kasumi raised an eyebrow, curiosity piqued: \\"Mimi Miney? No, I can't say I have...\\" Phoenix: \\"Mimi was involved in a complicated situation where she assumed her sister's identity after a tragic accident. It was a defense mechanism, a way to escape her past. Something tells me you might be going through something... not entirely dissimilar?\\" Kasumi's demeanor changed slightly, a hint of tension appearing in her posture. The Psyche-Locks visibly tightened. Kasumi, cautiously: \\"I'm... not exactly sure what you're suggesting, Mr. Wright.\\" Phoenix decided to approach the issue more gently, realizing the sensitivity of the situation. He couldn't just blurt out her secrets – especially regarding her true identity and the burdens she carried. Phoenix: \\"Let's just say that sometimes, people find themselves in situations where they feel the need to be someone else. It could be to protect themselves or maybe to protect someone they care about. The heart locks up these secrets tightly.\\" Kasumi looked down, contemplating Phoenix's words. It was clear that his message was hitting closer to home than she initially let on. Kasumi, with a hint of resignation in her voice: \\"It sounds like being a detective isn't all that different from being a gymnast. We both have our roles, our performances... But, Mr. Wright, how do you propose we unlock these... Psyche-Locks?\\" Phoenix smiled gently, offering reassurance: \\"By facing them together, with honesty and courage. It's not about prying or forcing those locks open. It's about understanding and accepting what's behind them. And remember, no matter how difficult or dark the secret, there's always a path forward.\\" Kasumi took a deep breath, a sense of determination settling in her eyes. She nodded, a silent agreement to embark on this journey of revelation with Phoenix. Phoenix, sensing her willingness, was ready to guide her through it: \\"Alright, Kasumi. Let's take this one step at a time. Together, we'll face those secrets, and we'll find the truth that lies beyond.\\" The dialogue between Phoenix Wright and Kasumi Yoshizawa didn't just promise an adventure into the unknown but a journey of trust, revelations, and ultimately, healing. As the Magatama glowed softly between them, it was clear that this encounter in the Velvet Room would mark the beginning of something profound. --- **Note:** The text carefully navigates around major spoilers, ensuring that it touches upon the themes of identity and secrets reminiscent of both characters' narratives without divulging critical plot details."},{"prompt":"tengo esta funcion en django class BuyerProfileView(TemplateView): template_name = 'buyer/buyer_profile_view.html' def get_context_data(self, **kwargs): context = super().get_context_data(**kwargs) context['user_id'] = self.request.user.pk return context necesito que al acceder a ella mediante la url /es/users/buyer-profile/address pase por contexto address asi como puede ser el caso que para /es/users/buyer-profile/preferences pase por contexto preferences me ayudarias porfa?","completion":"Para realizar lo que necesitas, tendrás que modificar tanto tus URLs como tu vista \`BuyerProfileView\` para poder manejar dinámicamente el contenido del contexto basado en los segmentos de la URL.

This tactic emphasizes winning the ball high up the pitch, maintaining possession, and quickly transitioning to attack. # System: 5-1-2-2 Gegenpress Formation and Roles - **GK**: Sweeper Keeper (Support) - This role supports the high defensive line by covering the space behind and being ready to clear backpasses or intercept through balls. - **CBs**: Three Central Defenders - The central defender in the middle should be on Cover duty to sweep up behind, with the other two on Stopper or Defend duty, ensuring a layered defensive structure that's effective against counter-attacks. - **WBs (Right and Left Wing-Backs)**: Complete Wing-Backs (Attack) - They are vital in providing width, overlapping with midfielders, and delivering crosses, besides pressing aggressively in the opposing half. - **DM**: Deep Lying Playmaker (Defend) - Sits in front of the defense to recycle possession and contributes to the build-up play, acting as a pivot in the transition from defense to attack. - **CMs (Central Midfielders)**: One on Box-to-Box Midfielder (Support) to provide energy, support in both boxes and help in transitions; and the other on Ball Winning Midfielder (Support) to press aggressively and win the ball high up the pitch. - **Forwards**: Two Advanced Forwards or a combination of one Advanced Forward and one False Nine/Deep-Lying Forward to disrupt the opposition's defensive line, with one focusing on stretching the defense and the other dropping deeper to link play. Team Instructions - **Mentality**: Positive - Encourages proactive play without being reckless. - **In Possession**: Focus on higher tempo and shorter passing to maintain possession but move the ball quickly. Use the instruction to \\"Play Out of Defence\\" to ensure controlled build-up and \\"Work Ball Into Box\\" to avoid wasteful shots. - **In Transition**: \\"Counter-Press\\" and \\"Counter\\" should be your go-to settings, ensuring your team immediately presses after losing possession and quickly moves forward when gaining possession. - **Out of Possession**: Deploy a higher line of engagement and a higher defensive line to compress space and win the ball high. Combine this with \\"Use Tighter Marking\\" and \\"Prevent Short GK Distribution\\" to increase the pressing intensity. Player Instructions - Wing-Backs: \\"Get Further Forward\\" to ensure they provide width and attacking options. - Deep Lying Playmaker: \\"Take More Risks\\" to encourage forward, penetrating passes. - Ball Winning Midfielder: \\"Tackle Harder\\" to enhance the aggressive winning of the ball. - Forwards: Depending on their roles, adjust individual instructions to suit their skills, e.g., \\"Move Into Channels\\" for Advanced Forwards or \\"Roam From Position\\" for a False Nine. # Final Remarks This tactic requires players with high stamina, work rate, and tactical discipline to sustain the intense pressing and quick transitions. It's crucial to have a strong, cohesive squad with good depth, as the gegenpressing style is physically demanding. Tailor training to improve players' passing, stamina, and pressing abilities. Regularly review and tweak your tactic based on opposition analysis and player performances. Remember, fluidity and the ability to adapt are key in maintaining a successful gegenpressing strategy throughout a season."},{"prompt":"Eres un escritor y creador de cómic profesional y crearás un cómic de acción llamado “Operación rescate” .

Переход к устойчивому развитию на 20 лет раньше поз волил бы построить более безопасный и более обеспеченный мир, при чем быстрее и с меньшими проблемами в аграрном секторе. В этом сце нарии население стабилизируется на уровне чуть больше 6 млрд чел., а не почти 8. Пик загрязнений имеет гораздо более низкое значение, и мир его преодолевает на 20 лет раньше. На сельское хозяйство загрязнение окружающей среды влияет значительно меньше, чем в Сценарии 9. Ожи даемая продолжительность жизни достигает 80 лет и продолжает оста ваться высокой. К концу XXI в. человечество сберегает больше невозоб новимых ресурсов, поэтому их разведка и добыча требуют меньше уси лий. Ожидаемая продолжительность жизни, производство продовольст вия, потребительских товаров и услуг на душу населения стабилизируют ся на более высоком уровне, чем в Сценарии 9. Населению в Сценарии 10 удается без проблем поддерживать высо кий уровень жизни и обеспечивать технологический прогресс. Это об щество наслаждается более благоприятной окружающей средой, распо лагает большим количеством ресурсов, имеет больше степеней свободы. Оно не подходит так близко к пределам допустимого и не балансирует на краю, как общество из Сценария 9. Такое будущее было вполне возмож ным. Однако в 1982 г. мир этой возможностью не воспользовался. С помощью модели World3 мы разработали огромное число других сценариев, а не только те одиннадцать, что описаны в книге. Мы иссле ровых тенденциях, которые позволили бы численности населения и эко номике вписаться в пределы устойчивости. Разумеется, модель содержит множество упрощений, многие факторы в ней вообще не учтены. Поэтому не стоит ориентироваться на конкретные численные значения во всех этих сценариях. Работа, которую мы проделали, позволила сделать два ключевых вывода, и уж в них-то мы уверены на сто процентов. Первый вывод из всех наших экспериментов состоит в том, что чем больше мир откладывает принятие решительных мер, тем больше сужаются долго временные перспективы человечества, тем меньше у него остается возможных вариантов. Промедление со снижением роста населения и стабилизацией производственного капитала означает, что загрязнение растет, все больше земель деградирует, и тем больше в абсолютном выра жении должны быть потоки продовольствия, услуг и товаров, чтобы поддерживать существование населения. Нужды больше, проблемы острее, возможностей меньше. Все это можно проиллюстрировать еще одним расчетом, в котором те же меры, что и в Сценарии 9, принимаются не в 2002 г., а на 20 лет позже. К этому моменту избежать неконтролируемый спад уже невозможно — слишком поздно. Отсрочка в два десятилетия позволяет численности насе ления достигнуть значения в 8 млрд чел. гораздо быстрее, чем это было в Сценарии 9. Из-за двадцатилетней задержки мер промышленное произ водство достигает гораздо более высокого уровня, чем в Сценарии 9. Учитывая дополнительную производственную активность и двадцати летнее отставание технологий по борьбе с загрязнением, мы получаем кризис загрязнений. Он уменьшает продуктивность земель, производство продовольствия падает, ожидаемая продолжительность жизни резко сокращается, и так же резко уменьшается численность населения. 20 лет бездействия вместо перехода к устойчивому развитию сильно сужают перспективы нашей модели мира и приводят его к череде потрясений, которая ничем хорошим не закончится. Меры, которые в определенный момент привели бы к успеху, теперь не дают никакого результата.Второй вывод из всех наших экспериментов состоит в том, что слишком большие материальные требования человечества к мировой системе тоже могут привести к катастрофе. Мы проводили расчеты по модели Woiid3 с абсолютно такими же настройками, что и в Сценарии 9, с одной лишь разницей: заданное производство промышленной продукции на душу населения стало больше в два раза. В этом случае моделируемый мир тоже","completion":"Представленный текст поднимает важную тему устойчивого развития и обозначает два ключевых вывода, которые следует учитывать. Первый вывод касается последствий откладывания принятия решений по устойчивому развитию - чем больше времени упущено, тем острее проблемы становятся и тем меньше возможных вариантов действий остается. Второй вывод обращает внимание на важность сокращения материальных требований человечества к мировой системе, чтобы избежать катастрофы. Текст показывает, что переход к устойчивому развитию в 1982 году, вместо 2002, привел бы к более благоприятным результатам, таким как стабильное население, более высокий уровень жизни, улучшение среды обитания, сбережение ресурсов и технологический прогресс. Однако отсрочка этого перехода на два десятилетия приводит к кризису - снижению продуктивности, ухудшению среды и сокращению продолжительности жизни. Считаю, что важно уделять внимание и ресурсы для устойчивого развития уже сейчас, чтобы избежать тяжелых последствий в будущем. Действия должны быть приняты немедленно, чтобы сократить материальные требования, обеспечить стабильность и сохранение ресурсов, и создать более благоприятное будущее для всех."},{"prompt":"Выразить свое мнение по следующему тексту: начинает стабилизировать численность населения и экономику с 2002 г. и использует те же технологии ресурсосбережения и борьбы с загрязнениями окружающей среды. Однако уровень, к которому стремится производство промышленной продукции на душу населения, поддержать не удается, если население превышает 7 млрд чел., какими бысовершенными при этом ни были технологии. Промышленное производство на душу населения достигнет заданного уровня после расчетного 2020 г.,но удержится на нем недолго. Максимум будет пройден около 2030 г., затем начнется постепенный спад. Про изводство продовольствия на душу населения снижается практически сразу после достижения пика, который приходится примерно на тот же год. Причина в том, что для достижения более высоких объемов матери ального производства и для борьбы с последствиями загрязнения требу ется все больше капитала. К расчетному 2050 г. потоки продовольствия и промышленной продукции на душу населения в таком взыскательном мире снижаются и оказываются существенно ниже, чем было в Сценарии 9, где мир проявлял умеренность в своих запросах. Доказывает ли этот расчет, что определенный в нем жизненный стан дарт в «реальном мире» удастся поддерживать для 7,5 млрд чел.? Ни в ко ем случае! Численные значения, введенные в программу, обладают боль шими допусками, их нельзя считать достоверными. Никакая модель не может дать точные прогнозы для мировой системы на 30 или 50 лет впе ред. Кто знает, может быть, даже большее число людей будет иметь уро вень достатка выше, чем в Сценарии 9. А может быть и по-другому: учи тывая, что в модели World3 нет войн, конфликтов, коррупции, а люди не совершают ошибок, ее расчеты слишком оптимистичны, и в «реальном мире» никогда не удастся поддержать уровень потребления из Сценария 9. Модель World3 в чем-то подобна черновому наброску архитектора. Она показывает взаимосвязь между основными параметрами, помогает обдумывать разные варианты будущего, в котором мы хотели бы жить, однако не дает никаких деталей в отношении сложных политических, психологических и личностных проблем, которые встретятся во время переходного процесса. Чтобы делать такие точные прогнозы, нужен на много более высокий уровень развития науки — существенно выше, чем сегодняшний. И если бы кто-то взялся создать такую модель, ему потре бовалось бы все профессиональное умение, сдержанность, способность признавать ошибки и желание постоянно совершенствовать работу по мере ее выполнения. Из наших экспериментов с моделью не следует автоматически делать вывод о том, что немедленное принятие мер по переходу к устойчивому развитию обеспечит привлекательное будущее, в то время как задержка в 10 или 20 лет приведет к катастрофе. Мы формулируем наше заключение иначе: запаздывание с принятием мер уменьшает наши возможности и снижает уровень достатка, который мог бы поддерживаться в устойчивом обществе. Из наших сценариев мы не делаем вывод о том, что потребление на уровне, превышающем сегодняшний на 10 или 20%, мо жет поддерживаться устойчиво, то время как уровень потребления вдвое выше непременно приведет к катастрофе. Однако мы заключаем, что ус- тойчивая система обеспечила бы большинству населения мира более привлекательные условия жизни, чем сегодня. С другой стороны, для населения численностью 6 или 8 млрд чел. совершенно невозможно предложить неограниченно высокий или просто очень высокий уровень материального потребления. Модель World3 нельзя использовать для поиска точных численных пределов устойчивости мировой системы. В мире нет ни одной модели, которая позволила бы это сделать, а может, никогда и не будет. Более то го, поиск максимально допустимого уровня экологической нагрузки, чтобы приблизиться к нему — путь опасный и чреватый последствиями, ведь текущие пределы роста изменчивые и неопределенные, а их изучение и возможные отклики всегда будут происходить с запаздыванием.

Текст отмечает, что высокий уровень производства промышленной продукции на душу населения может быть достигнут, но удержаться на нем недолго из-за увеличения численности населения. Производство продовольствия также снижается из-за нехватки капитала для борьбы с возрастающим загрязнением. Я согласен с автором, что нельзя полностью полагаться на расчеты модели World3 и точные численные прогнозы для долгосрочного будущего. Модель может показать взаимосвязь между различными параметрами и помочь обдумывать различные будущие сценарии, но она не учитывает сложности реального мира, такие как политические и психологические проблемы. Важно понимать, что путь к устойчивому развитию требует профессионализма, сдержанности и готовности признать ошибки для постоянного улучшения. Запаздывание с принятием мер по устойчивому развитию может уменьшить возможности и ухудшить уровень достатка общества в будущем.

W)rid3 была создана для исследования схем поведения нелинейной модели мировой системы, имеющей большое число внутренних взаимо связей, запаздываний и различных ограничений. Она не предназначена для того, чтобы выдавать количественные прогнозы на будущее или точные планы действий. Зато описываемые в этой главе расчеты подтвердили общие выводы, которые, по нашему убеждению, правильны и при этом далеко не все из них в настоящий момент признаны широкой об щественностью. Только представьте себе, насколько изменились бы при нимаемые решения, обсуждаемые законы, распределяемые инвестиции, освещаемые в новостях мировые события, если бы приводимая далее ин формация была широко известна и повсеместно признана: • Неизбежен компромисс между численностью населения, которую может выдержать планета, и уровнем материального благосостояния, который удастся обеспечить каждому ее жителю. Точные численные значения и за висимости при этом определить невозможно, к тому же они могут стано виться другими по мере развития технологий, знаний, умения человечества приспосабливаться, а также по мере изменения экосистем Земли. Но в любом случае остается верным правило: чем больше людей, тем ниже уровень материального благосостояния каждого из них и тем меньше должна быть экологическая нагрузка на душу населения. • Чем больше времени уйдет у человечества на ослабление экологической на грузки и на принятие мер по переходу к устойчивому развитию, тем ниже будут жизненные стандарты и тем меньшую численность населения удастся устойчиво поддерживать в системе. В определенный момент задержка ведет к катастрофе. • Чем выше устанавливаемый обществом уровень материального достатка и чем больше численность населения, тем выше риск того, что система выйдет за пределы, которые, вдобавок, будут постоянно нарушаться. В соответствии с нашими компьютерной моделью, мысленными моделями, доступными статистическими данными и представлениями о «реаль ном мире» общество не может медлить с принятием мер по переходу к ус тойчивому развитию и по возвращению системы в допустимые рамки и пределы. Если мы будем откладывать уменьшение потоков в системе и пе реход к устойчивому развитию, то в лучшем случае для будущих поколений уменьшатся возможности выбора, а в худшем случае наступит катастрофа. В любом случае время нельзя терять. Устойчивое развитие - новая идея для многих людей, и многие не сразу могут ее осознать. Но ведь по всему миру есть люди, которым вполне удалось освоиться в этой области знаний и научиться интуитивно понимать, что такое устойчивый мир. Для них это означает, что мир пойдет навстречу устойчивости не вынужденно, а по доброй воле, не с ощущением жертвы, а с отвагой и решимостью. Устойчивый мир может быть гораздо лучше того, в котором мы живем сейчасУстойчивость можно определить по-разному. Самое простое определе ние: общество устойчиво, если оно сохраняется на протяжении многих поколений, если оно обладает достаточной способностью прогнозировать, достаточной гибкостью, чтобы не подрывать как физические, так и социальные основы собственного существования. В 1987 г. Международная комиссия по окружающей среде и развитию выразила идею устойчивости в следующих словах: Устойчивое общество — это такое общество, которое «удовлетворяет свои потребности, не лишая будущие поколения возможности удовлетворять их собственные нужды»2 . С системной точки зрения устойчивое общество — это общество, в котором для контролирования положительных контуров обратной связи, ответственных за экспоненциальный рост численности населения и капитала, успешно используются информационные, социальные и орга низационные методы. Это значит, что рождаемость примерно равна смертности, а объемы инвестиций соответствуют объемам выбывания капитала (амортизации) до тех пор, пока не принимаются сознательные технические или социальные меры для продуманного и взвешенного изменения численности населения или промышленного капитала. Чтобы","completion":"Текст приводит важные рассуждения о пределах устойчивости мировой системы и необходимости принятия мер для перехода к устойчивому развитию. Он подчеркивает неизбежный компромисс между численностью населения и уровнем материального благосостояния, утверждая, что чем больше людей, тем меньше должна быть экологическая нагрузка на каждого из них. Авторы текста обращают внимание на важность времени в решении экологических проблем и перехода к устойчивому развитию. Они предупреждают, что отсрочка мер по снижению экологической нагрузки и переходу к устойчивому развитию может привести к ухудшению жизненных стандартов и катастрофе. Уровень материального достатка и численность населения напрямую влияют на устойчивость системы, и их необходимо контролировать для сохранения равновесия. Авторы призывают к принятию сознательных мер для улучшения устойчивости общества и подчеркивают, что устойчивый мир может быть лучше текущего. Они предлагают определение устойчивости как способность общества сохраняться на протяжении многих поколений, с умением прогнозировать и гибкостью для сохранения физических и социальных основ существования. Я согласен с авторами, что устойчивое развитие является важным аспектом современного общества, который требует срочных и сознательных действий. Контроль над численностью населения, соответствие инвестиций и выбыванию капитала, а также использование социальных и организационных методов для управления ростом, являются необходимыми шагами к созданию устойчивого и благополучного будущего для всех.

Чтобы пе рейти к устойчивости из сегодняшнего состояния мира, все остающиеся возможности роста - касается ли это использования ресурсов, выбросов загрязнений или резервов, которые высвобождаются за счет повышения эффективности и изменения стиля жизни людей в богатых странах мира, — все подобные излишки должны направляться тем, кто больше всего в них нуждается. Это логично, и мы надеемся, что такая точка зрения будет принята всеми. Устойчивое состояние вовсе не подразумевает, что общество находится в упадке или переживает застой, не означает это и безработицу и раз- - вал существующих экономических систем, которые обычно проявляются при вынужденном прекращении роста. Разница между устойчивым обществом и современным спадом экономики подобна различию между остановкой автомобиля разными способами: в первом случае вы пользуетесь тормозами и останавливаетесь плавно, во втором — с разгона врезаетесь в бетонную стену. Когда современная экономика выходит за пределы, изменения происходят слишком быстро и неожиданно для организаций и для людей, им приходится спешно переучиваться, менять работу, переезжать, заною приспосабливаться... Продуманный переход к устойчивому состоянию будет происходить сравнительно медленно, будет достаточно времени, чтобы всех предупредить и все продумать, чтобы и люди, и предприятия нашли свое место в новой экономике. Нет никаких причин, по которым устойчивое общество должно быть примитивным в техническом или культурном отношении. В мире, свобод ном от тревог и ненасытной жадности, возможности для творчества будут огромными. Раз обществу и окружающей среде не понадобится расплачи ваться за последствия роста, то вполне возможен большой прорыв в техно логии и культуре. Джон Стюарт Милл (John Stuart Mill), один из первых (и последних) экономистов, кто принял всерьез идею экономики, вписанной в пределы планеты, заметил, что «стационарное состояние», как мы его называем, может поддерживать постоянное изменение и совершенст вование общества. Сто пятьдесят с лишним лет назад он написал: Я не могу... рассматривать стационарное состояние капитала и богатства с тем искренним отвращением, которое столь свойственно политэкономистам старой школы. Я склонен считать, что в целом было бы достигнуто весьма существенное улучшение в сравнении с сегодняшним состоянием. Признаюсь честно, я вовсе не очарован идеалами, которые проповедуют те, кто считает нормальным состоянием человечества постоянную борьбу за выживание, кто верит, что топтать, давить, толкаться и наступать друг другу на пятки — желанный удел человечества... Едва ли нужно уточнять, что стационарное состояние капитала и населения вовсе не означает застой в человеческом совершенствовании. Возможностей для развития духовной культуры, морального и социального прогресса, а также для совершенствования Искусства Жизни будет ничуть не меньше, чем сейчас, а скорей всего — гораздо больше5 . Устойчивый мир не будет, да и не сможет быть застывшим, с патоло гически постоянными численностью населения, объемом производства или любым другим параметром. Одна из странных особенностей совре менных мысленных моделей — представление о том, что мир умеренно сти обязательно должен быть миром жесткого централизованного правительственного контроля. Для устойчивой экономики такой тип контроля невозможен, нежелателен, да и не нужен. (С системной точки зрения у этого вида управления слишком много недостатков, что нам наглядно продемонстрировал бывший Советский Союз.) Конечно, в устойчивом мире будут работать определенные правила, законы, стандарты, границы, социальные соглашения и ограничения, как и в любой другой человеческой культуре. Некоторые из правил устойчивого мира будут отличаться от тех, по которым люди живут сейчас. Некоторые виды контроля уже вступают в силу, например, международное соглашение по озону и договоренности по выбросам парниковых газов.

Важно, что возможности для творчества и развития будут огромными в устойчивом мире, свободном от жадности и последствий экологических проблем. Цитата Джона Стюарта Милла подчеркивает, что устойчивое состояние общества не означает застой в человеческом развитии, а, наоборот, может способствовать духовному и социальному прогрессу. Анализ авторов относительно контроля и управления также важен. Устойчивое общество не требует жесткого централизованного контроля, как это было обычным при принципах Советского Союза.

В экономических ценах должны отражаться и социальные, й экологические затраты. Показатели вроде ВВП придется переопределить, чтобы не было путаницы между прибылями или потоками и благосостоянием, или между ист6щением# природного капитала и доходами. Уменьшись время отклика. Необходимо отслеживать сигналы, которые свидетельствуют атом, что окружающая среда или общество испытывают напряжение. Необходимо заранее решать, какие действия предпринять в случае возникновения проблемы (в идеале она должна быть предсказана задолго до того, как проявится). Должны работать организационные и технические механизмы, позволяющие эффективно реагировать на проблему. Необходимо поощрять гибкость и творчество, развивать критическое мышление и способность преобразовывать как физические, так и социальные системы. Компьютерное моделирование на этом этапе может помочь, но самое важное, чтобы общее образование учило людей системному мышлению. Свести к минимуму использование невозобновимых ресурсов. Ископаемые виды топлива, грунтовые воды и минеральное сырье должны использоваться с максимально возможной эффективностью, перерабатываться и использоваться повторно (ископаемое топливо повторно использовать нельзя, однако воду и минеральное сырье — можно), и это использование должно быть только временным этапом при переходе на возобновимые источники. Не допускать истощения возобновимых ресурсов. Продуктивность почв, поверх ностные воды, восполняемые грунтовые воды и все формы жизни, включая леса, рыбу, животных, надо защищать, восстанавливать и улучшать всегда, когда эго возможно. Использовать эти ресурсы можно только с той скоростью, с которой они могут самовосстанавливаться. Поэтому необходимо собирать информацию о скорости восстановления, определять строгую социальную ответственность и принимать экономические меры, чтобы не допустить чрезмерного использования ресурсов. Использовать ресурсы с максимальной эффективностью. Чем больше благ для человека удастс%обеспечить при заданном уровне экологической нагрузки, тем выше бдет качество жизни в пределах устойчивости среды. Технически вполне можно достичь большей эффективности, к тому же это экономически выгодно7 . Высокая эффективность жизненно необходима для того, чтобы привести численность населения и экономику в соответствие с возможностями окружающей среды и не допустить возникновение катастрофы. Замедлить и затем остановить экспоненциальный рост населения и физического капитала. Первые шесть пунктов, перечисленных в этом списке, способны помочь только до определенного предела. Этот последний пункт — ключевой. Для его выполнения необходимы организационные и социаль ные меры, а также изменение философии. Необходимо определить, какой уровень численности населения и промышленного производства желателен и может устойчиво поддерживаться. Главной ценностью должно быть качественное развитие, а не рост. Для этого необходимо глубинное изменение в представлениях о цели человеческой жизни: она вовсе не должна быть посвящена только физическому расширению и накоплению. Что касается последнего пункта, необходимого для перехода к устой чивости, то прежде всего следует перечислить насущные проблемы, ко торые в большинстве случаев и являются глубинными причинами роста:","completion":"Данный текст предлагает шесть ключевых шагов и рекомендаций по достижению устойчивого развития на всех уровнях общества. 1. Улучшение приема и обработки сигналов, глубокое изучение благосостояния населения и воздействия на экосистему, а также оперативное информирование об экологических условиях и социальной ответственности. 2. Сведение к минимуму использование невозобновимых ресурсов и уменьшение времени отклика на напряжение в окружающей среде. 3. Предотвращение истощения возобновимых ресурсов за счет защиты и улучшения их состояния, использование ресурсов на скорости восстановления. 4. Использование ресурсов с максимальной эффективностью и высокой производительностью для обеспечения высокого качества жизни при уменьшении экологической нагрузки. 5.

Рост в своем со временном виде либо совсем не решает эти проблемы, либо делает это медленно и неэффективно. Но пока на горизонте не появятся более эффективные способы решения проблем, общество ни за что не отка жется от своего пристрастия к росту — ведь людям необходима надежда. Рост может внушать фальшивые надежды, но это лучше, чем ничего. Чтобы укрепить надежду и решить актуальные проблемы, необходи мо развить совершенно новые представления в трех областях. • Нищета. В политических обсуждениях и переговорах слово «делиться» на ходится под запретом. Может быть, вследствие укоренившейся глубокой веры в то, что если разделить на всех — не хватит никому. «Достаточность» и «общность интересов» - вот термины, которые помогут развить новые подходы, чтобы покончить с нищетой. В условиях выхода за пределы мы все равны. Если управлять миром грамотно, то хватит на всех. Если управлять неграмотно, то последствий не избежать никому, и тогда не спасут никакие богатства. • Безработица. Человеку необходимо работать, самореализовываться, совер шенствоваться, нести ответственность за удовлетворение собственных нужд, испытывать чувство причастности, получать признание как зрелому, ответственному члену общества. Это настоящая потребность, ее необходимо удовлетворять, и при этом работа не должна быть отупляющей или вредной для здоровья. В то же время занятость не должна быть единственным условием существования. Необходимо отказаться от ограниченного пред ставления о том, что одни люди «создают» рабочие места для других (и от еще более узкой идеи о том, что рабочая сила — просто статья расходов, ко торую нужно уменьшать). Это сделать нелегко, потребуются фантазия и творческий подход, ведь на самом деле нам необходима система экономики, использующая и поощряющая любой вклад, который люди могут внести. Она должна распределять работу, отдых и экономические результаты справедливо, не обходя своим вниманием и тех, кто по разным причинам временно или постоянно нетрудоспособен. • Неудовлетворенные материальные потребности. Людям не нужны огромные автомобили — на самом деле им нужны уважение и признание. Им не нужен бесконечный поток новой одежды - на самом деле им нужно чувствовать, что для других людей они привлекательны, нужно испытывать душевное волнение, видеть разнообразие и красоту вокруг. Людям не нужно засилье электроники — на самом деле им нужно нечто, что занимало бы их мысли и эмоции. Этот список можно продолжать до бесконечности. Пытаться удовлетворить реальные, но невещественные потребности (в самоутвер ждении, самооценке, самореализации, в общественном признании, любви и радости) с помощью материальных потоков — значит пробудить неутоми - мое стремление к ложным решениям, желание, которое никогда не будет удовлетворено полностью. Общество, которое признает невещественные потребности человека и найдет нематериальные же способы удовлетворить их, будет использовать гораздо меньшие потоки энергии и сырья и при этом продвинется гораздо дальше в стремлении к духовному совершенствованию. Что же может сделать для решения проблемы каждый из нас? Как мир может разработать систему, которая решит эти проблемы? Вот где широкий простор для творчества и изобретательности. Поколениям, живущим на границе тысячелетий, предстоит не только уменьшить экологическую нагрузку и привести ее в соответствие с возможностями Земли, но при этом еще и преобразовать свой внутренний и внешний мир. Этот процесс затронет все сферы жизни, в нем будет востребовано все разнообразие человеческих талантов. Навдуг применение новые технические и предпринимательские идеи, общественные, социальные, политические, художественные и духовные устремления. 50 лет назад Льюис Мэмфорд (Lewis Mumfoid) признал величие задачи и ее общечеловеческий характер; для ее решения необходимо воспитать лучшие человеческие качества в каждом из нас.

Автор указывает на то, что рост экономики может неэффективно решать данные проблемы, и подчеркивает необходимость развития новых подходов для борьбы с нищетой, безработицей и недостатком материальных потребностей. Он предлагает философские и социальные изменения, такие как введение понятия \\"достаточности\\" вместо \\"дележки\\", не ограничение работоспособности людей в обществе, а также удовлетворение невещественных потребностей через духовное развитие. Текст также подчеркивает важность справедливого распределения труда, отдыха и экономических результатов, а также соответствие материальных и невещественных потребностей человека. Автор призывает к уменьшению экологической нагрузки, духовному развитию и устремлениям к равновесию в обществе. Мне кажется, что текст представляет глубокие идеи о необходимости смены подходов к решению социальных проблем и отказу от концепции неограниченного роста в пользу устойчивого и равновесного развития общества.

One common method to achieve this is by using the \`transform\` property with the \`translateY\` function. This method allows you to move an element up (or down) along the Y-axis without affecting the layout of surrounding elements. Here's a simple CSS example: \`\`\`css .move-up-30px { transform: translateY(-30px); } \`\`\` In this example, a class named \`move-up-30px\` is defined. The \`translateY\` function moves the element \`-30px\` along the Y-axis, which means it will be shifted 30 pixels upwards. You can apply this class to any HTML element you want to move up. For example: \`\`\`html <div class=\\"move-up-30px\\">This div is moved up by 30 pixels.</div> \`\`\` Alternatively, you can use the \`margin-top\` property with a negative value to move the element up. However, unlike using \`transform: translateY\`, using negative margins affects the layout of surrounding elements by pulling them closer together. Here's how you could do it with \`margin-top\`: \`\`\`css .move-up-30px-margin { margin-top: -30px; } \`\`\` And apply it as follows: \`\`\`html <div class=\\"move-up-30px-margin\\">This div is moved up by 30 pixels using margin-top.</div> \`\`\` Using \`transform: translateY\` is generally the preferred method when you want to shift an element's position visually without impacting the document's layout flow. Choose the most appropriate approach based on your specific design and layout needs."},{"prompt":"Create a dialogue between Phoenix Wright and Dr. Maruki.

This conversation contains spoilers for both \\"Persona 5 Royal\\" and the \\"Ace Attorney\\" series. --- **Phoenix Wright:** Dr. Maruki, thank you for meeting with me. I've been looking into a series of events that seem... out of the ordinary. And all clues have pointed me to you. **Dr. Takuto Maruki:** It's my pleasure, Mr. Wright. I've heard about your accomplishments. How can I help you today? **Phoenix Wright:** (Notices red psyche-locks around Dr. Maruki) Ah, I was afraid of this. Dr. Maruki, there's something you're not telling me. Something critical related to the phenomena happening around town. **Dr. Takuto Maruki:** Is that so? I'm not sure what you're referring to. I'm merely a counselor, after all. **Phoenix Wright:** (Takes out the magatama) Dr. Maruki, I believe you're withholding vital information that could explain the surreal events impacting people's lives. *(As Phoenix focuses, several red psyche-locks appear around Dr. Maruki, signifying deep, hidden secrets.)* **Dr. Takuto Maruki:** (Sighs) I see. There's no hiding from the eyes of an ace attorney, is there? Very well. I assume you're talking about the changes in reality, the dreams becoming true? **Phoenix Wright:** Exactly. How are you doing it, Dr. Maruki? **Dr. Takuto Maruki:** It's a long story, Mr. Wright, involving an accident, my own desires, and awakening to a unique power... My ability allows me to create a reality based on human cognition - the reality where people's deepest desires come true, to ease their hearts. **Phoenix Wright:** That's... quite something. But playing with reality? Isn't that dangerous? What about the truth? The real emotions and events that shape us? **Dr. Takuto Maruki:** Everyone suffers, Mr. Wright. If you had the power to alleviate that suffering, to give people a chance at happiness, wouldn't you use it? **Phoenix Wright:** But at what cost, Dr. Maruki? The truth is essential. It’s what guides us, teaches us. Altering reality to remove suffering... It’s like denying who we are, our very existence. **Dr. Takuto Maruki:** I understand your concern, but consider the possibility of a world without hurt, Mr. Wright. Is adhering to the harsh truths of reality always the best path? **Phoenix Wright:** It’s not about choosing the easy path, Dr. Maruki. It’s about facing our realities, no matter how tough. That’s what makes us grow. Your ideal world... It’s a fantasy. True change and happiness come from understanding and accepting the truth, not hiding from it. **Dr. Takuto Maruki:** I see your point, Mr. Wright. But humans are inherently weak. Not everyone can face their truths as bravely as you suggest. **Phoenix Wright:** Maybe. But it’s through our struggles that we find our strength, Dr. Maruki. I believe everyone has the potential to face their reality, no matter how difficult. And it's our duty to support them through it, not change the narrative. **Dr. Takuki Maruki:** (Looks contemplative) Perhaps... I've been too focused on my ideal resolution. Your perspective is indeed enlightening, Mr. Wright. Maybe... there's a different path to healing. *(As Dr. Maruki begins to accept Phoenix's point of view, the red psyche-locks start to disappear, signifying his acceptance of the truth and willingness to confront reality.)* **Phoenix Wright:** It’s about finding balance, Dr. Maruki. Embracing the truth doesn’t mean we let the weight of it crush us. It means we face it head-on, together. And that’s what makes us stronger, that's what leads us to genuine happiness. **Dr. Takuto Maruki:** Thank you, Mr. Wright. This conversation has given me a lot to think about. Perhaps it's time I faced my own truths as well. **Phoenix Wright:** I'm glad to hear that, Dr. Maruki.

Rumor has it that Nicktoons Network UK is going to overhauling their branding at the beginning of 2019. It looks like it’s the end of an era for ACOW the Robot and the current look. What are your thoughts on this? I’m kinda gonna miss the little robot mascot. 🤖💔 --- **Username: CoolToons25** Posted on 29th November 2018 What?! No way, ACOW has been such an iconic part of the Nicktoons branding. 😭 Do we have any idea what the new branding is going to be like? Or why they are deciding to make this change now? Honestly, it’s hard to imagine the channel without it. --- **Username: AnimationNostalgia** Posted on 30th November 2018 I read about this too. It's sad but I guess channels evolve over time. From what I understand, they’re looking to refresh their image and make it more appealing to today’s audience. I suppose ACOW the Robot does have a very late ‘00s vibe to it that might not resonate with younger viewers anymore. Still, it’ll be tough to say goodbye. 😟 --- **Username: NickLoyalist** Posted on 30th November 2018 As much as I love the current branding, I’m kinda excited to see what they come up with next. Companies rebrand all the time to stay current. Maybe we’ll get something even cooler than ACOW! We've had great memories, but let's face it, every show, character, or branding has its time. 🕰️🚀 --- **Username: VintageToonFan** Posted on 1st December 2018 I just hope they manage to keep the spirit of the channel alive, whatever the new branding turns out to be. Nicktoons has always been about fun, creativity, and a bit of quirkiness. It’d be a shame if they lost that in an effort to be more \\"modern\\".

Sapphire doesn't just duel against Lily, but also against 6 year old Iris. Lily and Iris duel as a tag team so the effects are duplicated for Iris. Both Lily and Iris get to cast spells each round: Create a roleplaying game fantasy scenario where I play Sapphire, a 16-year-old girl mage who’s the current champion of magic dueling in the teen division. 6-year-old Lily is challenging me to a match and I accept. In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 5 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats, which should be higher than Lily’s because I’m 10 years older than her. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that regresses me by 2 years and ages her by 2 years every time I cast a spell, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex exponential and accelerating formula that dictates by how much my stats decrease each turn and take into account that the age regression is 2 years per turn. The number that my stats decrease on a given turn are added to Lily’s stats to reflect on the fact she’s essentially siphoning my abilities and my physical and mental age. By the end of the duel, I’ll be 6 years old and Lily will be 16. After I first regress introduce also a set of childish, insecurity, and immaturity stats that may hinder the casting of mature spells, and as I regress, these stats increase for me exponentially. Childish stats aren’t required for casting spells, but they lower the points given for mature spells. Lily won’t have childish stats because these stats don’t interact with her spells. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). Lily’s spellcasting stats should start at 10% of my stats.

However, today stands a unique challenge before you, not just from the 6-year-old prodigy Lily, but also from her tag-team partner, Iris, another magically gifted 6-year-old. Together, they form a formidable duo, their spells now amplified and intricately linked due to their tag-team synergy. As the sun dips below the horizon, signaling the start of the duel, you feel a subtle shift in your magic. Unbeknownst to you, Lily has cast a peculiar spell that initiates a staggering transformation, aging you down by 2 years with every spell you cast, while Lily and Iris gain those years, growing both physically and in magical prowess. # Starting Stats: - **Sapphire (You):** Age 16, Spellcasting Power: 100, Childish Insecurity: 0 - **Lily & Iris (Tag Team):** Age 6, Spellcasting Power: 10, Childish Insecurity: N/A # Age & Stats Dynamics: Every time you cast a spell, you regress by 2 years, your spellcasting power weakens exponentially, and your childish insecurity stats increase exponentially. This reflects your growing immaturity and impacts your ability to cast mature spells effectively. The exponential formula affecting your spellcasting power and childish insecurity is as follows, after each spell: [ text{New Spellcasting Power} = text{Current Spellcasting Power} times (0.9 - text{Round Number} times 0.05) ] [ text{Childish Insecurity} = text{Childish Insecurity} + (2^{text{Round Number}}) ] - For Lily & Iris, they gain what you lose, making their combined magical abilities more formidable as the duel progresses. # Spells: **Sapphire's Spells:** 1. Azure Whirlwind: 90 Power 2. Crystal Barrier: 80 Power 3. Phantom Mirage: 70 Power 4. Celestial Cascade: 60 Power 5. Ember Flash: 50 Power 6. Frost Veil: 40 Power 7. Mystic Bloom: 30 Power 8. Starlight Beam: 20 Power 9. Lunar Cloak: 10 Power 10. Radiant Pulse: 5 Power **Lily & Iris's Spells:** 1. Sparkling Mischief: 10 Power 2. Bubble Jinx: 20 Power 3. Gleeful Whispers: 30 Power 4. Twinkling Tornado: 40 Power 5. Enchanted Vine Snare: 50 Power 6. Radiance of the Pixie: 60 Power 7. Mirthful Shroud: 70 Power 8. Dazzling Descent: 80 Power 9. Whimsical Wonderland: 90 Power 10. Infinite Illusions: 100 Power # Scenario Progress: **Round 1:** Your confident commencement is met with the playful magic of Lily and Iris, their giggles carrying through the air as spells fly. However, after your first spell, your consciousness shifts, the world seeming larger, your thoughts tinged with an innocence forgotten. - **Age Tracker:** Sapphire: 14, Lily & Iris: 8 & 8 **Round 2:** Your youthful regression confounds you, the spells in your repertoire seemingly daunting. Lily and Iris's spells now carry a weight and maturity that belies their tender age, their magic dazzling the audience twice over. - **Age Tracker:** Sapphire: 12, Lily & Iris: 10 & 10 **Round 3-5:** With each spell you cast, the world around you grows increasingly whimsical, your spells tinged with an unintentional childish flair that detracts from their majesty. Lily and Iris, now matching your original age, wield your spells against you with a proficiency that astonishes the onlookers. The role reversal is complete, with the final spells cast amidst an arena that blurs before your eyes, your comprehension clouded by the innocence of youth. - **Final Age Tracker:** Sapphire: 6, Lily & Iris: 16 & 16 As the duel concludes, the crowd erupts in applause, not just for the magic, but for the dramatic journey of growth and regression that unfolded before them. The judges deliberate, their scores reflecting not just the beauty of the spells cast but the courage it took to face such an unpredictable challenge."},{"prompt":"Reinhardt is a 23 Years old boy, very solitary.

Maruki","completion":"In the scenario laid out, Reinhardt has found himself unexpectedly at the office of Dr. Takuto Maruki, a therapist known for his unconventional methods and warmth. Maruki, unknowing of Reinhardt's extraordinary background, senses a profound unease within him. Dr. Maruki: So, Reinhardt, what brings you in today? I could sense you hold something deeply concealed, something that perhaps even you might not fully understand. Reinhardt shifts uncomfortably, his eyes darting around the minimalist office, taking in the soothing colors and the gentle light. He’s not used to opening up, especially about the aspects of himself that he barely understands. Reinhardt: I... It’s hard to explain. It’s not just one thing, it’s... everything. I’ve always felt different, and there are parts of me that I can’t just share with others. Dr. Maruki nods empathetically, his gaze steady and patient. Dr. Maruki: It's perfectly okay to feel that way. Our differences are what make us unique, after all. But if these...differences, are causing you distress, maybe it’s worth exploring them together. You mentioned feeling different. Would you like to share more about what you mean by that? Reinhardt hesitates, torn between his innate privacy and the strange comfort he feels in Maruki's presence. He decides to walk a middle path. Reinhardt: It’s...about my abilities. I have some... skills that are not quite normal. It makes living a normal life...complicated. Dr. Maruki, always intrigued by the unique facets of the human psyche, leans forward, his voice soft yet encouraging. Dr. Maruki: Abilities, you say? It sounds like these are a significant part of who you are. It’s not uncommon for individuals to struggle with embracing their unique talents, especially if they feel isolated because of them. What kind of abilities are we talking about, if you don’t mind me asking? Reinhardt studies Dr. Maruki for a moment, debating how much to reveal. Finally, he decides on a partial truth. Reinhardt: Lets just say, I can do things with fire and heal very quickly. The specifics don’t matter. What matters is it’s made me keep people at a distance. I...I don’t want to, but it’s safer that way. Dr. Maruki: I understand that safety can sometimes feel like the priority, especially when we’re protecting a part of ourselves that we fear others won’t understand. But by doing so, we also keep ourselves from making true connections. It’s a delicate balance, isn’t it? Finding a way to be true to ourselves while also letting others in. Reinhardt nods, a bit surprised by the understanding in Maruki’s voice. Reinhardt: Exactly. It’s like... you know. Dr. Maruki smiles gently, hoping to reassure Reinhardt. Dr. Maruki: While I may not know everything about you, Reinhardt, I do understand the struggle of balancing personal truths with the fear of being misunderstood. But remember, it’s your uniqueness that adds color to the world. And perhaps, in time, you’ll find people who understand and appreciate you for everything that you are, abilities and all. Reinhardt feels an unexpected sense of relief washing over him. For the first time in a long while, he allows himself to consider the possibility of not being alone in his struggles. Reinhardt: That would be...nice. I’ve kept these walls up for so long; I don’t even know where to start taking them down. Dr. Maruki: Sometimes, the first step is the hardest. But you’ve already made it by coming here today. Together, we can explore this path at a pace that feels right to you. The session gradually progresses, with Reinhardt feeling a bit lighter with each passing moment. While he knows his journey is far from over, the unexpected guidance of Dr. Maruki offers a glimmer of hope, a possibility that his differences could one day become his greatest strengths."},{"prompt":"I want you to make several changes in the text of the following prompt.

Your challenge comes from an unprecedented source: a tag team duo consisting of 6-year-old Iris and her partner Lily. This duel is not just a test of strength but of endurance and strategy, as you face not one, but two challengers who are linked in magic and ambition. # **Game Mechanics:** **1. Rounds:** - The game consists of 5 rounds. **2. Spell Casting:** - Each participant can cast one spell per round. - Iris and Lily cast independently each round, but effects that influence them are duplicated due to their link. - No spell may be repeated during the duel. **3. Aging Mechanism:** - Initially, Sapphire is 16. Iris and Lily are both 6. - Post every spell Sapphire casts, she regresses by 2 years, and Iris and Lily each age by 2 years. - This affects Sapphire’s spellcasting stats and introduces \\"childish\\" stats that hamper mature spell effectiveness. **4. Stats:** - Sapphire's initial spellcasting stats are superior but degrade due to the aging mechanism. - Iris's and Lily's stats start at 10% of Sapphire’s but improve with each round due to the aging mechanism. - Childish, insecurity, and immaturity stats impact Sapphire's performance in casting mature spells as the duel progresses. **5. Spells:** - Mature spells require high spellcasting stats but are susceptible to reductions from childish stats. - If the stats required for a spell fall below the necessary threshold, the spell fails and points are deducted. - Iris and Lily can steal unused spells from Sapphire's list if their combined stats allow. # **Difficulty:** The overall difficulty of the game is set at 10 - the highest mode. This scenario is designed to be a severe test of both strategic depth and adaptability. # **Spells List:** **Sapphire's Spells:** 1. Crystal Cascade (High) 2. Veil of the Aurora (Medium) 3. Midnight Sunbeam (Medium) 4. Whispering Winds (Low) 5. Starlight Shroud (High) 6. Echoes of the Ancients (Medium) 7. Lunar Embrace (Low) 8. Tears of the Phoenix (High) 9. Celestial Bonds (Medium) 10. Shadows of the Fallen (Low) **Iris and Lily’s Spells:** 1. Dawn's First Light (Low) 2. Twilight Veil (Medium) 3. Spectral Dance (Medium) 4. Ember Wisp (Low) 5. Frost Harmony (Medium) 6. Radiant Bloom (Low) 7. Mirage of Ages (High) 8. Starborn Aegis (Medium) 9. Heart of the Storm (High) 10. Eternal Requiem (High) # **Age Tracker:** - **Start:** - Sapphire: 16 years - Iris & Lily: 6 years each - **After Round 1:** - Sapphire: 14 years - Iris & Lily: 8 years each - (Continue similarly for subsequent rounds.) # **Narrative Hooks:** - As Sapphire regresses in age, her perspective on the duel changes. She starts confident and mature but slowly becomes more playful, impulsive, and less focused on the strategic aspects of the duel. - The evolving dynamic between Iris and Lily as they \\"grow\\" could provide them an unexpected edge or create new challenges as they adapt to their rapidly changing capabilities. # **Gameplay:** - Players decide Sapphire’s spells for each round. - The Game Master controls Iris and Lily, deciding their spells based on strategy and the evolving scenario. - The outcome of each spell is determined by comparing the appropriate stats, accounting for the age-related changes and the impact of childish stats on Sapphire. - The winner is determined based on total points scored for spell beauty and effectiveness, minus any deductions for failed spells. # **Conclusion:** This game challenges players to balance power with vulnerability, showcasing the value of wisdom and the potential of youth. Sapphire’s journey through this duel is one of growth, not just in magic but in understanding the essence of change and adaptability."},{"prompt":"Reinhardt is a 23 Years old boy, very solitary.

Iris and Lily, gaining confidence and strength, move on to cast **Radiant Hearts** and **Twinkling Tendrils**, each spell doubled in intensity due to their tag team advantage, and both executed with increasing finesse as they draw from Sapphire’s waning power. **Age Tracker:** - Sapphire: 12 - Iris: 10 - Lily: 10 Subsequent Rounds: As the rounds progress, Sapphire attempts to combat her rapidly degrading capabilities, with her spells losing their mature elegance due to the increase in childish stats. The complexity of creating a spectacle diminishes with each round, her ability to comprehend her spells' grandeur fading into a child’s simplistic joy. Iris and Lily, now matching and then exceeding Sapphire in age and power, dazzle the crowd with increasingly sophisticated spells from both their list and stolen from Sapphire’s uncast spells, their execution flawless and doubling in magnificence each time. **Final Age Tracker:** - Sapphire: 6 - Iris: 16 - Lily: 16 # Conclusion: The duel concludes in an unprecedented upset, with Iris and Lily declared the new champions. Sapphire, now the same age as Iris and Lily were when they challenged her, finds herself struggling to understand the enormity of her loss. The audience, however, is treated to a once-in-a-lifetime spectacle of magic that bridges the gap between innocence and maturity, leaving them in awe. Through this trial, Sapphire learns a harsh lesson in underestimating one's opponents and the unpredictable nature of magic. As she adjusts to her new reality, she vows to reclaim her title, not through sheer power but by understanding and mastering the delicate balance between strength and vulnerability. In the years to come, Sapphire's journey back to prominence would be recounted as a tale of resilience, adaptation, and the enduring spirit of competition that defines the greatest of magic duels."},{"prompt":"Reinhardt is a 23 Years old boy, very solitary.

Who knows, I might even surprise you with mine. **Reinhardt:** (sternly) Fine. But keep it to yourself. I'm... different because I was born between two worlds. My abilities, they're not ordinary. Fire, resurrection, even knowledge beyond my understanding—when my eyes turn red. **Adachi:** (eyes widen with a mix of intrigue and excitement) Now, that's fascinating! A half-Phoenix, was it? And here I thought I had the market cornered on being unusual. (pauses) You know, with your skills, you could do anything. Bend the world to your will. Why play the loner card? **Reinhardt:** (shakes his head) That's not who I am, Adachi. Power, manipulation... it's not the answer. It's about making the right choices, even when they're hard. My abilities don't define my morality. **Adachi:** (reflectively) Right choices, huh? (sighs) Maybe in a different life, I could've seen the world like you do. But choices, they're funny things. Sometimes, they make monsters out of us. **Reinhardt:** (looks at Adachi, a hint of empathy in his eyes) Maybe. But it's never too late to choose a different path. We all have the capacity for change, Adachi. Regardless of the past. **Adachi:** (gives a wry smile) Well, aren't you the philosopher. Alright, then, Mr. Moral Compass, lead the way with your inferno eyes. Just don't get us killed, okay? I'm not exactly looking forward to finding out if resurrection is part of my skill set. **Reinhardt:** (smiles lightly) I'll do my best. Let's get out of here, together. --- This imagined dialogue shows both Reinhardt’s reluctance to reveal his origins and abilities and his innate kindness, as he tries to see the good in Adachi despite knowing who he truly is. It also highlights Adachi's complex nature, oscillating between cynicism and a fleeting desire for redemption."},{"prompt":"Comment souhaitez joyeux anniversaire à une jolie fille","completion":"Joyeux anniversaire à la plus jolie des filles !

Si te cobraron 50USD estabas moviendo 2500USD y te conviene dividir la transacción, porque la comisión es siempre porcentual. Tampoco pretender que te cobren 10 pesos por sacar 2 millones. \\"","completion":"Dividir las transacciones puede ser conveniente por varias razones, especialmente cuando las tarifas o comisiones involucradas en las transacciones son estructuradas de manera que hay un componente fijo (un monto constante) y un componente variable (un porcentaje del monto transferido). Vamos a desglosar el ejemplo que diste para entender mejor el razonamiento detrás de la recomendación de dividir la transacción. 1. **Comisión estructurada**: en el ejemplo, la comisión es del 2.04% del monto transferido más un componente fijo de 0.1 USD. Esto significa que siempre habrá una porción de la comisión que aumenta proporcionalmente con el tamaño de la transacción y una pequeña porción que no cambia. 2. **Ejemplo de la transferencia de 100 USD**: si transfieres 100 USD a un banco argentino, la comisión sería 2.04% de 100 USD más el costo fijo de 0.1 USD. Esto implica que la comisión total sería 2.04 USD + 0.1 USD = 2.14 USD. 3. **Ejemplo de la comisión de 50 USD en una transferencia de 2500 USD**: si entendiéramos que, al hacer una transferencia de 2500 USD, la comisión fue de 50 USD, esto ilustra un ejemplo en el cual el costo de la transacción se vuelve considerablemente alto debido al volumen de la transferencia. La estructura de comisión implica que cuanto mayor sea el monto transferido, mayor será la comisión en términos absolutos (aunque se mantenga el mismo porcentaje). 4. **Beneficio de dividir la transacción**: el beneficio de dividir grandes transacciones en varias más pequeñas radica en el manejo más eficiente del componente fijo de la comisión. Si bien el componente porcentual permanece constante sin importar cómo dividas la transacción, al dividirla, no estás incrementando el costo fijo total de manera significativa. Para sumas grandes, la diferencia por el componente porcentual podría no ser muy impactante, pero ahorrar en el componente fijo (reduciendo su impacto en el costo total) puede ser una estrategia útil. 5. **Consideración práctica**: existen otras consideraciones prácticas al dividir transacciones, como límites diarios de transferencia impuestos por bancos o servicios financieros, tiempos de procesamiento, y posibles banderas de seguridad que se pueden levantar por realizar múltiples transacciones en corto tiempo. Sin embargo, desde el punto de vista puramente económico, dividir transacciones puede hacer más eficiente el manejo de costos. En conclusión, dividir transacciones para manejar de manera más eficiente las comisiones aplicables tiene sentido especialmente cuando estas incluyen componentes fijos junto a los porcentuales. En este caso, la estrategia de división busca minimizar el impacto relativo del costo fijo en el monto total de las comisiones pagadas."},{"prompt":"en el ejemplo de los 2500 como lo dividiras para restar la comison","completion":"Para optimizar la comisión involucrada en una transferencia de 2500 USD, consideremos la estructura de comisiones dada: 2.04% de comisión variable por transacción más un costo fijo de 0.1 USD por transacción. El objetivo es reducir el impacto total de estas comisiones dividiendo el monto total en varias transacciones más pequeñas. Sin embargo, hay que tener en cuenta que cada transacción incurre en el costo fijo de 0.1 USD. **Calculando la comisión original para 2500 USD:** - Comisión variable: 2.04% de 2500 USD = 51 USD - Comisión fija: 0.1 USD - Comisión total para una sola transacción: 51 USD + 0.1 USD = 51.1 USD **Dividiendo la transacción:** Una estrategia podría ser dividir los 2500 USD en montos menores, digamos, de 500 USD cada uno. Esto nos daría cinco transacciones separadas. Para cada transacción de 500 USD, la comisión sería: - Comisión variable: 2.04% de 500 USD = 10.20 USD - Comisión fija: 0.1 USD En cada una de estas transacciones menores, la comisión total sería de 10.30 USD. **Calculando la comisión total para las transacciones divididas:** - Comisión total para 5 transacciones de 500 USD: 5 * 10.30 USD = 51.5 USD Como vemos en este cálculo, dividir el monto total de 2500 USD en transacciones de 500 USD no reduce la comisión total, y de hecho, incrementa ligeramente la comisión debido al costo fijo aplicado a cada transacción. Aquí cometí un error conceptual en mi explicación previa: para optimizar las comisiones basándonos simplemente en la proporción de comisiones fijas y variables, necesitamos considerar cuidadosamente si el ahorro en la comisión variable realmente compensa el incremento en la comisión fija total al realizar múltiples transacciones menores. El punto crítico aquí es que, dado que la comisión fija es muy baja (0.1 USD por transacción) comparada con la comisión variable (2.04%), el impacto de dividir la transacción en partes más pequeñas no necesariamente resulta en un beneficio significativo y, dependiendo de cómo se estructuren las divisiones, podría incluso ser contraproducente. **Nota importante:** La estrategia para optimizar comisiones depende fuertemente de la estructura específica de las comisiones. En algunos casos, especialmente cuando hay costos fijos altos o cuando el costo variable es muy bajo, dividir las transacciones puede ofrecer ahorros significativos. Sin embargo, en este caso particular, donde el costo fijo es extremadamente bajo en comparación con la comisión porcentual, la división de la transacción no ofrece una ventaja clara. Por tanto, la mejor estrategia para minimizar comisiones debe considerar cuidadosamente la estructura de comisiones específica de la operación en cuestión. En algunos casos, como cuando se realizan inversiones o se manejan grandes sumas de dinero en entornos con estructuras de comisión más complejas, consultarlo con un asesor financiero puede ser la mejor opción para obtener una estrategia óptima."},{"prompt":"Reinhardt is a 23 Years old boy, very solitary.
