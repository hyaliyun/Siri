away with the rise of the Tokugawa shogunate in the early 17th century, forging a period of enforced peace and isolation known as the Edo period. But while the samurai swords lay sheathed, the spirit of the age-old strife merely slumbered, awaiting resurgence in a world vastly different from the one that had witnessed the unification under the Tokugawa clan. The 20th century saw tremendous transformations across East Asia. In the Korean Peninsula, the once small, tributary kingdom of Dae Joeson-gug, founded by Yi-Seong-gye in 1392, had seen the end of its line in 1898 after centuries of Ming influence and Japanese colonial encroachment. The peninsula was then torn into two distinct entities after the fall of the Soviet-backed northern regime and the southern dictatorship, both in the tide of pro-democracy movements of the 1980s. The ebb and flow of dynastic power in Nihon had been historically entrenched in the symbiosis between military rulers and a symbolic imperial lineage. Despite the semblance of imperial governance, true power lay in the hands of the seii taishōgun of the Tokugawa dynasty, while the Minamoto-descended Kōshitsu presided over Shinto rites and regalia, enshrined in ethereal authority. In the 1980s, echoes of the past reverberated through the political landscape of East Asia as nationalistic fervor once again clawed its way to the forefront during the uprisings in Zhōnghuá. The so-called “Liùsì” Shìjiàn, with its profound human cry for democracy and liberty, confronted the stolid face of despotism and sowed the seeds of discord as it demanded recognition in the People's Republic. Similarly, the spirit of Minjung in the South Korean realm underscored a critical shift in the nation's political discourse, challenging the authoritarian grasp of power and setting the stage for reunification ambitions with its northern counterpart. It triggered a cascade of events reminiscent of the regional strife that had once been the hallmark of the Warring States period. As the monolithic structure of Soviet influence in Asia crumbled, the chokehold of totalitarian regimes on the Korean Peninsula weakened and eventually imploded, leading to a volatile power vacuum—one that had not been seen since the end of the Tokugawa's shogunate rulership over the Nihon Hondo. Caught in the wake of the Cold War's resolution, the curtain fell on a world system that had managed an uneasy peace reminiscent of the pax Tokugawa. With the clanging fall of the Iron Curtain and the collapse of its Asian proxies, the tapestry of East Asia began to unravel. Unrest, long stifled by authoritarian hands, now surfaced with a rejuvenated drive for autonomy, governance, and identity. National factions and revived monarchies endeavored to fill the spaces left by fallen ideologies and defunct administrations. Just as the Sengoku period had seen a multitude of daimyos vying for dominion over fragmented territories, modern warlords—blending political cunning with economic prowess—emerged to stake their claims in a new era of contention. All across the Nihon Hondo, from the snow-dusted peaks of Hokkaido to the subtropical Ryūkyū, whispers of rebellion stirred. Much like the ronin of old, disillusioned samurai of the modern age, now businessmen and politicians, articulated their own visions for their country's future. This fresh onset of warring states threatened to unravel decades of carefully curated peace in a dance dangerously reminiscent of the ancient chaos. The disintegration of inveterate power structures across East Asia signaled not just the end of old order but the birth pangs of new world dynamics reminiscent of the feuding provinces of old. As history's pendulum swung back, the contemporary Warring States era dawned, promising a complex tableau of fractious allegiances and contentious sovereignty struggles. A new chapter awaited scripting by those deft enough to navigate the tides of revolution and resurgent ambition."},{"prompt":"Staying and continuing with the alternate history scenario prompted and generated in the previous entry: What exactly goes on in the rest of East Asia [during the resumption of the Sengoku Jidai in the late 1980s]?

To the south of the troubled mainland, the Chunghwa Minkuo, governed by the iron grip of the Kuomingtang, stood on the island of Taiwan—a bastion of anti-communist sentiment and burgeoning democratic ideals. Shielded since 1947 by the waters of the Taiwan Strait, the Nationalist regime, with its staunch anti-communist stance, had repelled the communist advance at the culmination of the Zhōngguó Nèizhàn and established a hardscrabble existence distinct from the mainland. As turmoil ravaged the continent, the Chunghwa Minkuo saw within the throes of upheaval an unprecedented opportunity. While the fall of singular authoritarian control unfurled across the mainland, the Kuomingtang harbored designs to extend its rule back to the hearts and minds of the Zhōngguó populace. With the Zhōnghuá Rénmín Gònghéguó's hold fracturing amidst the clamors for freedom, the prospect of reclaiming the lost nation under the 'One China' principle loomed large in the aspirations of the Taiwanese polity. The support for the Chunghwa Minkuo—curiously manifested via both American and Soviet rapprochement—was predicated on the overarching desire to stave off the chaos that might spread from unfettered fragmentation. By bolstering the Nationalist front, the erstwhile rival superpowers aimed to curate a semblance of order on the mainland, anchoring it to a known quantity in the face of explosive schisms and unexpected alliances that threatened geopolitical equilibrium. Parallel to the dreams of reunification across the strait, the archipelago of Nihon grappled with its own shadows of the past. Surfaces of unity and civility belied undercurrents of political factionalism and ideological contention. The hermetic seclusion and rigidity of societal structure from the Tokugawa years had given way to a global economic powerhouse, yet the ethos of the samurai lingered on, mutated in form, carrying the seeds of discord beneath a veneer of homogeneity. In the bustling metropolises and prefectural offices across the Nihon Hondo, the memory of the Sengoku Jidai was not merely the repose of a time long gone; it insinuated itself into the corporate boardrooms and policy debate halls. Economic sagas and political maneuverings bore the semblance of feudal power struggles, while a nascent civil society began to question the entrenched powers that be. It was a quiet yet palpable resurgence—one that did not brandish the katana but wielded influence through information and finances. Far from the professed unity and peace that blanketed the islands, Nihon was fraught with its own tensions as age-old lines of division resurfaced in unexpected ways. Grassroots civic movements and radical political sects pointed towards a polity engaged in a new kind of warfare—a battle for the country's soul in an age where traditional norms were increasingly at odds with dynamic modernity.

period of the late 1980s, as the specter of the Sengoku Jidai loomed over East Asia, the Zhōngguó, or the Middle Kingdom, witnessed an eruption of fractious entities vying for power amid the unraveling of central authority. Many warlord states emerged, each with divergent visions and objectives, often colored by historical grievances and territorial claims. The Chunghwa Minkuo's audacious bid to reclaim the mainland was symbolized by a series of strategic military advances, seizing upon the chaos to establish footholds in coastal provinces. While they did not regain full control of the continent, the efforts yielded pockets of influence, effectively creating buffer states and warlord regions that were at times tacitly aligned with them. Amid this fracturing landscape, various warlord states carved out their dominions: 1. The Economic Dominions - Warlord states that rose in the financial hubs as makeshift city-states prioritized economic independence and influence. Their main goals revolved around wealth accumulation and establishing trade networks that spanned the Asia-Pacific. 2. The Military Regimes - Ruled by former generals of the disintegrated national army, these states focused on consolidating military might, often imposing martial law and seeking to expand territories through force. 3. The Ideological Enclaves - Territories bound together by shared political or religious beliefs, ranging from Marxist-socialist communes to traditionalist revanchist regions. These aimed to rekindle what they saw as the \\"true spirit\\" of the Zhōngguó. The mosaic of warlord states was not merely a political phenomenon but also a manifestation of the deep-rooted cultural and historical identities that had been forcibly homogenized under the preceding regimes. Within this volatile mix, monarchists, royalists, restorationists, and those aligned with imperialist sensibilities, particularly factions that reminisced over the lost glories of the Ming, gained considerable traction. Han nationalist and supremacist groups yearned for the restoration of perceived historical greatness and purity. Such factions endorsed the reestablishment of the Dà Míngguō and the Zhūshì Huángshì, advocating for a unified Zhōngguó under a renewed imperial banner, drawing inspiration from the former splendor of the Great Ming. These monarchist entities played substantial roles in the new warlord states, often holding sway over the political and military structures. They operated as kingmakers and power brokers, manipulating the political chessboard in favor of a return to monarchial governance, or at the very least, a central authority that revered traditional Han culture. Their relationship with democratic reformist and pro-monarchy movements, however, was tinged with suspicion and rivalry. While all sought an end to the instability and fragmentation, the monarchists and royalists were skeptical of the democracy advocates' commitment to hierarchical social structures and cultural norms that underpinned their vision of the ideal state. Conflicts between these parties were inevitable, with each faction championing its concept of governance and societal order. Monarchist warlords strengthened their hold on their dominions by appealing to a romanticized past, leveraging it against the ideological modernization and political liberalization championed by their rivals. This dynamic interaction among warlords, monarchists, and reformists established a fluid and contentious battleground in the struggle for the Middle Kingdom's future, as these disparate forces grappled for ascendancy amidst the shadow of a revived Sengoku Jidai."},{"prompt":"Staying and continuing with the alternate history scenario prompted and generated in the previous entries: Great!

During this period, both the authoritarian regime of the Dàhán Mínguó in the south and the Soviet satellite state of the Chosŏn Minjujuŭi Inmin Konghwaguk in the north found themselves on the precipice of transformative change. In the south, the pro-democracy Minjung movement gained momentum, challenging the dictatorial government and advocating for greater civil liberties and political reform. Economically, the south had experienced rapid industrialization and growth, which proved to be both a stabilizing force and a source of discontent, as economic disparities became more pronounced. The north faced its own set of challenges. Economic hardships, compounded by the weakening of the Soviet Union, led to a decline in state welfare and a questioning of the regime's legitimacy. Military loyalty, once a given for the Pyongyang government, became uncertain as factions within the armed forces began to grapple for power and influence. Amidst this internal instability, localized warlordism did not take hold in Hanguk as it did in the Zhōngguó. Instead, the hegemonic entities of the north and south maintained a tenuous grasp over their respective territories, although both faced relentless pressure from burgeoning grass-roots movements and the prospect of foreign intervention. Nihon, having emerged a global economic power, keenly observed these developments. Historical ties, cultural connections, and a strategic position within the Asia-Pacific region placed Hanguk high on Nihon's agenda. Nihon leveraged its economic prowess to deepen its influence on the peninsula. It offered financial aid, investment, and technological expertise to the south, tying the fate of the Dàhán Mínguó's economy to its own. As for the north, Nihon engaged in delicate diplomacy, skillfully navigating the geopolitical landscape to position itself as a potential broker for peaceful reunification efforts. However, reintegration of Hanguk into Nihon's sphere of influence was fraught with complexity. The collective memory of Japanese imperialist aggression during the first half of the 20th century remained vivid among Hanguk-saram. Efforts towards reintegration had to be meticulously crafted to not reignite resentments. Nihon approached the matter through economic interdependence, cultural soft power, and carefully calibrated political engagement, aiming to cast itself not as a hegemon but as a partner in Hanguk's advancement. With an understanding of these sensitive historical dynamics, Nihon eschewed overt militaristic postures in favor of building bilateral ties that could eventually lead to a regional alliance or economic union. As such, the strategy for reintegrating Hanguk relied heavily on fostering a shared future vision that promised mutual prosperity and security. While the path toward reunification of the Korean Peninsula and its potential integration into Nihon's sphere remained uncertain, what was clear was that the age-old motif of Sengoku Jidai—regional powers striving for ascendancy—played out yet again on the historical stage, albeit under the guise of modernity's multifaceted struggles for power and identity."},{"prompt":"As an expert in analytical writing, your task is to write [the analysis below and adhere to all of its parameters, informed by its argument, consideration, description and details].

Proposition: Illustrate and describe how the future of education will be virtual reality training simulations. Unlike the historic and current method of teaching where a singular teacher or professor stands in front of a classroom of students lecturing them on the topic or area of study which the educator is an expert in, the way education and learning is taught will be radically transformed in the near future with the advent of artificial intelligence technology programs in the form of immersive virtual reality modules that train students on particular and specific tasks that they can learn from through the process of repetition and interactive feedback from the AI simulations. Each student is seated in front of a large inwardly concave screen where they engage in study and learning by prompting the AI computer system to begin a particular training simulation. The AI creates a virtual simulation that the student undertakes, but appropriate to the pupil's level of learning whether it be novice, intermediate or expert, whereby the simulation replicates a novel situation based on real world scenarios the student has to complete or diagnosis in order to receive a satisfactory passing grade. Students are given the opportunity to replay the simulation, but their grades will reflect the do over as a diminished accomplishment since in real life, second chances are rare. That is not to say that students in the educational phase of their lives won't appreciate the nature of the AI program in terms of helping them understand and learn, but that in terms of assessing intelligence and ability of the students, this simulation method prevents students from cheating themselves and their education, which has been the problem with many current attempts of improving education with technology. The role of educators in terms of transmitting information and learning from themselves to their pupils will be altered whereby the teachers transition to building and creating the virtual reality modules for each specific training regime they want their students to learn about in terms of the task. In effect, teachers will become programmers who input discrete scenarios into the modules that the AI computer system replicates and transforms to simulations that each student uses to learn and train on. If a particular job requires an understanding of a complex idea or presentation, the teacher's uses their expertise to program that exact scenario into the module, which is then given to the student to try to fulfill those instructions in the simulation. Under this system, the best educators will offer their expertise and advice through the modules as a product that students can acquire to learn on and train to become experts and professionals themselves. If the students satisfactorily pass the difficult simulations according to the teacher's grading, then the student in effect graduates and can use their learned knowledge and understanding as ranked and validated by the AI program to obtain jobs and careers whereby the employers would have confidence that their prospective applicants have the ability and skills to do the job such that they can be hired as employees of the firm. Note: The inward concave screen replaces the need for virtual reality headsets and gloves.","completion":"In the envisioned future of education, the traditional classroom setting—one characterized by its static espousal of lectures with students as passive recipients—will undergo a revolutionary metamorphosis. This decoupling from the conventional will be catalyzed by the burgeoning prowess of artificial intelligence (AI) and the seductive promises of virtual reality (VR). The mechanism of this transformation manifests in the form of virtual reality training simulations that act as dynamic pedagogic environments, where knowledge is not simply imparted, but experienced, manipulated, and truly mastered. Within the confines of these academic sanctuaries, one witnesses students arranged in front of large, inwardly concave screens that eschew the need for cumbersome VR headsets and gloves. These screens serve as windows to other realities, where abstract concepts are rendered tangible, and where theory seamlessly melds with practical application. A virtuoso of electric circuits, a neophyte in surgery, or a budding historian exploring ancient civilizations, each can invoke customized simulations that adapt to their respective proficiencies: novice, intermediate, or expert. The milieu of the simulation is punctuated by verisimilitude—it mimics the complexity and unpredictability of the real world with staggering authenticity. Through the iterative process of engaging with and resolving nuanced scenarios—be it performing a delicate operation or navigating the intricacies of diplomatic negotiations—students hone their skills with a meticulousness that is unattainable through rote learning. The almost tactile feedback from the AI simulation provides an immediacy of understanding, bridging the gap between the abstract and the applied, and cementing the principles in a way that is both profound and permanent. However, the feedback mechanism is not devoid of rigour; it embodies the realism that in true life, one is seldom afforded the luxury of second attempts. Grades, hence, are reflective of performance on the first trial, with subsequent efforts, although beneficial for learning, being annotated as lesser achievements—a poignant reminder of the high stakes and limited retakes that define actual professional scenarios. This paradigm shift in educational methodology is, however, not without its implications on the role of educators. The erstwhile figure of a teacher, a beacon of expertise espousing wisdom, transforms into a creator, a designer of these verisimilar worlds. As custodians of knowledge, they now channel their erudition into constructing the framework of these intricate simulations. Teachers metamorphose into skilful programmers, articulating and embedding their specialized knowledge into the VR modules. Their sagacity finds new expression as they craft scenarios that not only educate but challenge, inspire and impassion their students. The marriage of pedagogic finesse and programming omits not the sanctity of expertise; rather, it enhances it, entrusting the educators with the sacred duty to architect learning journeys that are immersive, comprehensive, and unabashedly demanding. The virtual environments conceived are didactic masterpieces, enabling students to encounter and surmount challenges that mirror professional real-world problems. The educators, now, have a loftier vocation: they do not merely disseminate information, they immortalize it within the fabric of the simulation, allowing students to wade into the depths of their disciplines. The consecration of learning is completed when a student emerges on the other side of these rigorous simulations, their success validated by the infallible judgment of the AI. The education obtained, the skillsets honed, and the understanding deepened are all meticulously vetted by the system, producing graduates whose proficiency is not just provable, but endorsed by the very technology that trained them. Employers thus find themselves reassured, convinced of the capabilities of their prospective hires, secure in the knowledge that these individuals possess abilities honed by simulations that brook no deceit and tolerate no mediocrity. The landscape of education is poised on the cusp of this renaissance, with virtual reality simulations holding the torch that will illuminate the path ahead—a path where learning is not just imparted, but entwined with the very essence of experience, and where education synthesizes with simulation to yield a pedagogy that is immersive, impeccable, and, above all, imminently transformative."},{"prompt":"rewrite in the style, grammar and language of a professional expert and analyst evaluating and describing the proposition.","completion":"The impending transformation of the educational paradigm from traditional lectures to virtual reality (VR) training simulations signals a profound redefinition of pedagogical methods. Anticipating the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with immersive VR modules, it stands to reason that learners will benefit from a significantly more interactive and nuanced educational experience. Foremost, the technological underpinning of this transformation—manifested through large, inwardly concave screens—affords each student a personalized learning environment. These screens obviate the necessity for the typically cumbersome VR headsets and gloves, providing an unencumbered interface with the digital realm. The AI-driven simulations that unfold within these screens are calibrated to a student's level of expertise, presenting scenarios that not only encapsulate the complexities of real-world applications but also demand a keen synthesis of knowledge and decision-making. The introduction of VR simulations offers an experiential pedagogy wherein repetition and responsive feedback converge to facilitate a mastery of skills. Unlike the one-dimensional informational flow of traditional didactics, VR simulations provide a multidimensional learning arena where students can apply theoretical knowledge in practice. The immediate feedback loop inherent in these AI systems serves not only as a correctional tool but also as a catalyst for cognitive reinforcement. Nonetheless, the systematic grading that penalizes reliance on multiple attempts mirrors real-world professional dictates, where mistakes bear consequences and excellence is often a function of first-time performance. Adaptation to this emergent technology also necessitates a paradigmatic shift in the educator’s role. Instructors, traditionally seen as disseminators of information, are poised to assume the mantle of simulation architects. Their expertise must now be channeled into creating and programming VR modules that accurately and effectively simulate professional scenarios. This reorientation elevates the teacher's role from one of delivery to one of design, where their industry-specific acumen is transformed into intricate virtual experiences that serve to instruct and challenge students. Under such a system, the most effective educators will be those who adeptly translate their subject matter expertise into the digital domain. The notion of teaching as an act of direct transmission is supplanted by the concept of educators as creators of sophisticated, interactive simulations. These AI-enabled virtual environments afford learners the opportunity to navigate through and resolve complex problems, thereby granting educators a more enduring and consequential influence on students' professional readiness. Credentialing through this mode of AI-assisted VR education assures a high degree of veracity with regard to a student’s capabilities. As graduates’ proficiency is gleaned from simulation performance measured by rigorous AI standards, employers are furnished with a credible assurance of the aptitude of potential employees. The acumen of these graduates, as vetted by these AI systems, assures industry of a workforce trained to a new standard of excellence. In conclusion, the integration of AI into VR modules in education heralds a significant departure from traditional methods, fostering a highly interactive, immersive, and skill-centered learning experience. As educational institutions and professionals adjust to these advances, the potential to enhance learning efficacy and better prepare students for real-world challenges is both substantial and within reach. The professional expert and analyst can, therefore, view this proposition not as a mere speculative fancy, but as a consequential evolution in the educational landscape."},{"prompt":"choose a random animal, one word only","completion":"Okapi"},{"prompt":"Write a list of 10 fictious Zootopia fan theories.

The Kingdom of Tungning, under the Zheng dynasty, also known as the Royal House of Koxinga, was re-established as the sovereign government of mainland China in 1991, amid the global shifts that marked the end of the Cold War. Section I: The Dawn of Transition The final years of the People's Republic of China (PRC), governed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), were rife with internal strife and widespread dissatisfaction. By the late 1980s, the CCP's grip on power weakened as both domestic and international pressures soared. The CCP, having led China as a staunchly authoritarian and nationalist regime with Nazi-like tendencies, faced insurmountable challenges as the global tide turned against such oppressive governance. In 1989, a widespread pro-democracy movement, propagated through the winds of Glasnost and Perestroika from the Soviet Union, gripped the nation. The Tungning movement, initially a cultural revivalist group inspired by the Ming loyalists of previous centuries, found itself in a unique position to influence the direction of the country. Its leaders, direct descendants of the Zheng dynasty, called for a restoration of the traditional values and the royal lineage as an antidote to the pervasive maladies inflicted by decades of CCP rule. Section II: The Silent Revolution Contrary to expectations of a tumultuous overthrow, the transition from the PRC to a monarchical structure under the Tungning Kingdom was comparatively peaceful. The galvanization of the masses had already been achieved through years of cultural and educational dissemination. Coupled with the disintegration of the CCP’s authority and a burgeoning desire for change among the populace, Tungning advocates cleverly positioned the monarchy as a symbol of unity and stability. As former Warsaw Pact nations pivoted toward democracy and capitalism, the CCP found its ideological backers waning. The Tungning Kingdom's proponents, having infiltrated influential positions within Chinese society, initiated a bloodless coup that saw the abdication of the CCP in December 1990. In a surprising twist of fate, the party capitulated under the precondition that the unity of China be maintained and a semblance of order be preserved through the transition. Section III: The Fate of the Captive Nations The restoration of the Tungning dynasty brought about sweeping reforms for the captive nations within China’s vast territories. Recognizing the untenable nature of previous suppressive policies, Tungning rulers granted substantial autonomy to Manchuria, Tibet, Inner Mongolia, and East Turkestan. These regions were transformed into semi-autonomous protectorates, allowed to exercise considerable self-governance while acknowledging the sovereignty of the Tungning throne. This arrangement secured not only internal harmony but also garnered international support. Many nations, eager to engage with a China no longer perceived as expansionist or oppressive, welcomed the reinstated Tungning kingdom with diplomatic recognition and economic partnerships. Section IV: The Reinstated Imperial Family The reinstated Tungning Kingdom, embracing its royal roots, found legitimacy in the lineage of the original Zheng family, yet with a modern constitutional twist. The Zheng descendants took their place on the throne not as absolute monarchs but as constitutional figures, symbolizing national identity and continuity. The former imperial family of the Ming, the House of Zhu, long having assimilated into obscurity, were ceremoniously honored by the new Tungning rulers. The Kingdom, acutely aware of the delicate balance between tradition and progress, refrained from stoking dynastic rivalries and instead ensured the Zhu descendants were revered as historical dignitaries and pillars of the age-old civilization that continued to shape the nation's cultural heritage. In the new constitutional monarchy, the Kingdom of Tungning emerged as a beacon of synthesis—melding heritage with modernity, order with freedom, and ceremony with practical governance. In retrospect, the year 1991 not only marked the end of the Cold War but also heralded the unprecedented revival of an ancient dynasty, ushering China into an era of renewal and renaissance hitherto unforeseen in the chronicles of time."},{"prompt":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 charactersOkapi","completion":"\\"Whimsical Okapi

The Kingdom of Tungning, ruled by the formidable Zheng dynasty, also known as the Royal House of Koxinga, was a steadfast loyalist state and a rump kingdom of the mighty Ming Empire, which had held dominion over Han China from 1368 until its eventual fall in 1644. It was in 1991, as the inclement Cold War breezes subsided to give way to a spring of nations, that the winds of change swept across mainland China. The People’s Republic of China, a fascist state under the iron grip of the Chinese Communist Party, crumbled. This party had long styled itself as a Nazi-like regime, suppressing freedoms and controlling China with an unyielding ideology. Yet as with all tyrannies, its foundations eventually fractured under the weight of the people's desire for liberty and justice. The fall of the Communist regime occurred amidst global upheaval. The Soviet Union, a titan of communism, had collapsed, catalyzing changes that rippled across Asia. Within China, a combination of civil unrest, economic instability, and international pressure led to the disintegration of authoritarian rule. The movement to restore the Kingdom of Tungning, though initially a whisper in scholarly circles and among the old royalists, burgeoned into a cacophony of voices demanding change. In what is now termed the “Silk Revolution,” millions across the nation called for a restoration of monarchical order—an appeal to a golden age before the advent of communism. The revolution was noted for its remarkably peaceful nature, as protesters donned the white robes of the old Ming loyalists, petitioning for a return to traditional governance. The transition from republic to monarchy, though peaceful, was intricate. A National Restoration Council was established, incorporating representatives from across the societal spectrum, including scholars, former politicians, and members of the Zheng lineage, which had, remarkably, survived through the centuries in obscurity. As these negotiations continued, the captive nations once held by the communist regime found their chains loosened. A series of referenda, supervised by an international collective, allowed Manchuria, Tibet, Inner Mongolia, and East Turkestan to determine their destinies, leading to the liberation and independence of these regions. The respect for self-determination was a keystone of the new Tungning government's policy, as they sought to redeem themselves for historical imperial overreach. The coronation of the new monarch from the Zheng royal line was a ceremonial expression of the Chinese renaissance. The restored Kingdom of Tungning, with its capital masterfully restored in Taiwan, promised a return to Confucian ethics, cultural revival, and economic mindfulness that harkened back to the grandiose days of the Great Ming. The once exiled Zhu imperial family was bestowed honors and titles in an effort to heal the wounds of the past, cementing a narrative of reconciliation and continuity. In the ensuing years, the Kingdom of Tungning has strived to bridge the divide between ancient heritage and modern governance. While the allure of the ancient dynastic era captivated the masses yearning for change, the royal family has adopted a constitutional model which acknowledges the need for democratic principles within a modern state framework. The reformation and reinstallation of the Kingdom of Tungning remains a staggering historical development, echoing the past yet looking determinedly towards the future. This new chapter in Chinese history marks not only the resurgence of a dynasty but the reinvention of a nation embracing the idea that the echoes of history can, indeed, shape the melody of tomorrow."},{"prompt":"Write a list of 10 fictious Zootopia theories.

They are not actual fan theories and are certainly not part of the official Disney canon or endorsed by Disney in any way. 1. **Judy's Lucky Foot:** Some fans speculate that the reason Judy Hopps is such an incredible police officer is because she has a literal lucky rabbit's foot. They argue she's always in the right place at the right time because of her innate good fortune. 2. **Nick's Hustler School:** There's a theory that Nick Wilde didn't just become a skilled hustler on his own. He actually attended a secret school for con artists, hidden in the depths of Zootopia, that teaches the arts of charm and deception. 3. **Carrot Pen's True Purpose:** It's believed by some that Judy's carrot pen is actually an advanced piece of spy tech given to her by a covert branch of the ZPD, with features we've yet to see, like a carrot hologram projector or a veggie-based grappling hook. 4. **Bellwether's Shear Madness:** A rather odd theory is that Assistant Mayor Bellwether's villainous turn was the direct result of a bad haircut, which altered her mood and perception, driving her to her extreme actions. 5. **Gazelle is a Secret Agent:** Gazelle isn't just Zootopia's biggest pop star; according to one humorous theory, she's also a secret agent using her performances to communicate with spies in the audience. Her backup tiger dancers? Elite bodyguards. 6. **The Pineapple Incident:** There’s a tongue-in-cheek theory that Zootopia has a pineapple under the sea where an aquatic counterpart of the city exists, complete with fishy versions of Judy and Nick solving underwater crimes. 7. **Zootopia is a Reality Show:** One theory suggests that the lives of Zootopia's citizens are actually a wildly popular reality TV show for the animal kingdom, unbeknownst to the protagonists. Every event in the film is carefully orchestrated by off-screen producers. 8. **Duke Weaselton's Wizardry:** Duke Weaselton is not just a weasel with a penchant for theft, but a misunderstood wizard trapped in Zootopia. Fans 'believe' that his bootleg DVDs are actually spellbooks, and he's gathering resources to cast a spell that will return him to his original fantasy world. 9. **Ele-Finnick:** It is humorously theorized that Finnick, the fennec fox who is often seen in an elephant costume, may actually be a shapeshifting elephant who prefers the fox life, hence his uncanny ability to convincingly look, sound, and act like an elephant. 10. **The Cosmic Carrot Conspiracy:** The wildest theory of them all posits that Zootopia is actually in a carrot-shaped galaxy, where cosmic carrots influence destiny.

The origins of the Dongning Wangchao could be traced back to the waning days of the Great Ming, as the Zheng dynasty, also recognized as the Royal House of Koxinga, established the kingdom as both a bulwark and heir to the Ming's lost sovereignty. They ruled portions of southwestern Taiwan and the Pengu Islands from 1661 until 1683 before their eventual collapse under the weight of external pressures. The unexpected revival of the Dongning Wangchao, replacing the People’s Republic of China, was nothing short of an epochal transformation. The People's Republic, a Han Chinese nationalist supremacist state under the guise of the Chinese Communist Party, had ruled mainland China in an iron grip akin to fascism. However, the seeds of discontent had been sown deep, and the tendrils of change were whispering through the alleys of Beijing. The transition from a so-called Marxist republic to a monarchy did not follow the expected trajectory of violent revolution. Instead, as the Cold War cooled and crumbled with the dissolution of the Soviet Union, a series of peaceful demonstrations and intellectual discourse paved the way for monarchy. It started with an internal movement within the Communist Party, where progressive factions saw the necessity of a new symbol of national unity, one that transcended the ideological divides of the previous decades. The academics and historians suggested the restoration of the Dongning Wangchao, which they remembered as a symbol of resistance against foreign domination and as an embodiment of traditional Han Chinese values. Covertly, they began talks with the descendants of the Zheng dynasty, who had quietly maintained their lineage and were living in relative obscurity. The movement gained momentum, eventually culminating in what came to be known as the Purple Lotus Revolution—a nonviolent civilian uprising that called for the restoration of the royal family and the governance of a monarch with the consent of the governed. In a historic plebiscite, the People's Republic of China was peacefully dissolved, and the Dongning Wangchao was instated as the government of mainland China. The transition was marked by both jubilation and introspection as the nation contemplated its new path ahead. The captives nations, Manchuria, Tibet, Inner Mongolia, and East Turkestan, were granted independent referendums, where each decisively chose self-sovereignty. They emerged as autonomous regions, maintaining close alliances with the reformed Chinese state while retaining their distinct ethnic and cultural identities. As for the Imperial House of Zhu, its once-exiled members were received with mixed emotions—reverence, skepticism, but ultimately acceptance. The former imperial family was offered positions of honor and ceremonial roles within the Dongning Wangchao, ensuring that their historical presence was acknowledged and preserved within the new political order. Thus, with the emergence of the Dongning Wangchao, a new era had begun for China—an era where the monarchy stood not for absolute power, but as a symbolic nod to a bygone day and as a unifying icon for a diverse populace, eager to step into the future while acknowledging the indelible marks of its past."},{"prompt":"Write a realistic, sensible, plausible and alternate history scenario in the

The winds of reform and revolution swept through the vastness of the Middle Kingdom, ultimately culminating in the re-emergence of the ancient Dongning Wangchao as the new ruling state. This chapter will explore the complexities, struggles, and resurgence of the once forgotten dynasty and the changing fate of the Chinese lands under its auspices. The Zheng dynasty, known to many as the Royal House of Koxinga, and to history as the architects of the kingdom of Tungning, endured in the annals of the Chinese not as mere usurpers but as rightful guardians of the Ming legacy. The fall of their short-lived kingdom in 1683 to the Qing conquest was mourned as the death of the last bastion of Ming loyalism. Yet, their indomitable spirit, it would seem, never wavered. The time had come for the cadres of the People's Republic of China, under the strict dominion of the Chinese Communist Party, to face the consequences of their oppressive regime. The year was 1991, and the world watched with bated breath as the Cold War's dying embers were doused by the winds of change. In China, the cries for liberty and tradition found a voice that resounded through the generations, echoing from the age of the Great Ming, whose imperial family, the House of Zhu, had reigned from 1368 to 1644 over China, and later, albeit indirectly, over Vietnam from 1802. The Revolution of Restoration, as it would be remembered, was neither a violent insurrection nor a democratic transition. It was akin to a peaceful cultural renaissance led by intellectuals, historians, and patriots who leveraged the fading power of the CCP to galvanize the masses. This was not a movement seeded by foreign hands but a domestic awakening that sought to revive the dragon's ancient spirit. Among the many factions vying for power in the chaotic landscape of China's political arena, a surprising player emerged: the descendants of the Zheng family. Rekindled by the promise of a renewed Confucian order and championed by the people's will, the Dongning Wangchao reclaimed their ancestral heritage and established themselves as the new custodians of the Chinese heartland. The restoration of the Dongning Wangchao was marked by an unprecedented decree known as \\"The Edict of Harmonious Unification.\\" It recognized the separate identities of the captive nations within China's yoke - Dongbei, Xiziang, Nei Menggu, and Xingjiang. The decree granted them autonomy within a harmonious Chinese commonwealth, akin to the structure of a federation. This vision of a sovereign yet united greater China not only quelled the rising tides of secession but also restored the dignity of these diverse cultures. As the Dongning Wangchao assumed control, the CCP was quietly dismantled, its leaders provided safe passage to exile or integrated into the new system based on their willingness to adapt. The party's staunchest members vanished from the public stage, some fading into obscurity, while others met less forgiving fates at the hands of a populace eager to erase the painful memories of authoritarianism. The former Zhūshì Huángshì, ever the symbol of the glorious Ming past, were restored to a place of honor within the kingdom. Respectful of the delicate sensibilities surrounding the power dynamics of monarchy and democracy, the Zheng royal family opted for a constitutional role, focusing on the spiritual and cultural rejuvenation of the nation. In an age where autocrats and dictators clung to their thrones with iron fists, the Zhengs became benevolent patrons of the state, their rule characterized by an unwavering commitment to the welfare of their subjects. The systematic release of state-controlled industries and the establishment of a multi-party system heralded a golden age of economic prosperity, civil liberties, and renewed national pride. This peaceful transition to a modern constitutional monarchy rekindled the spirit of the Long Ming, re-establishing a semblance of the dynasty's eons-long connection to the core of Chinese civilization. The restoration breathed new life into a culture that had persevered despite centuries of upheaval, and it laid the foundation for an era of unprecedented peace and prosperity that would see China ascend once more to the pinnacle of global reverence. As the sun set on a century marred by bloodshed and the oppression of the human spirit, it rose on Tungning - the old beacon of hope reborn, guiding China through the uncertain waters of the future with the steadfast light of its illustrious past."},{"prompt":"hi","completion":"Hello!

Proposition: Illustrate and describe how the future of education will be virtual reality training simulations. Unlike the historic and current method of teaching where a singular teacher or professor stands in front of a classroom of students lecturing them on the topic or area of study which the educator is an expert in, the way education and learning is taught will be radically transformed in the near future with the advent of artificial intelligence technology programs in the form of immersive virtual reality modules that train students on particular and specific tasks that they can learn from through the process of repetition and interactive feedback from the AI simulations. Each student is seated in front of a large inwardly concave screen where they engage in study and learning by prompting the AI computer system to begin a particular training simulation. The AI creates a virtual simulation that the student undertakes, but appropriate to the pupil's level of learning whether it be novice, intermediate or expert, whereby the simulation replicates a novel situation based on real world scenarios the student has to complete or diagnosis in order to receive a satisfactory passing grade. Students are given the opportunity to replay the simulation, but their grades will reflect the do over as a diminished accomplishment since in real life, second chances are rare. That is not to say that students in the educational phase of their lives won't appreciate the nature of the AI program in terms of helping them understand and learn, but that in terms of assessing intelligence and ability of the students, this simulation method prevents students from cheating themselves and their education, which has been the problem with many current attempts of improving education with technology. The role of educators in terms of transmitting information and learning from themselves to their pupils will be altered whereby the teachers transition to building and creating the virtual reality modules for each specific training regime they want their students to learn about in terms of the task. In effect, teachers will become programmers who input discrete scenarios into the modules that the AI computer system replicates and transforms to simulations that each student uses to learn and train on. If a particular job requires an understanding of a complex idea or presentation, the teacher's uses their expertise to program that exact scenario into the module, which is then given to the student to try to fulfill those instructions in the simulation. Under this system, the best educators will offer their expertise and advice through the modules as a product that students can acquire to learn on and train to become experts and professionals themselves. If the students satisfactorily pass the difficult simulations according to the teacher's grading, then the student in effect graduates and can use their learned knowledge and understanding as ranked and validated by the AI program to obtain jobs and careers whereby the employers would have confidence that their prospective applicants have the ability and skills to do the job such that they can be hired as employees of the firm. Note: The inward concave screen replaces the need for virtual reality headsets and gloves.","completion":"Envision a world where the typical classroom, lined with desks and adorned with a chalkboard, is supplanted by a semi-circle of expansive, inwardly concave screens. Each student is ensconced before these screens, not as passive recipients of a didactic lecture, but as active participants in a dynamic educational sojourn, forged by cutting-edge artificial intelligence. The future of education is not a distant dream but an imminent reality—a landscape where virtual reality training simulations are the bedrock of learning and skill acquisition. These simulations, a symbiosis of AI prowess and meticulously crafted programming, offer a paradigm shift in pedagogy. No longer are students limited by the static variables of textbooks or the unidimensional presentation of knowledge by an educator. Instead, they delve into a rich, multi-sensory experience that mirrors real-world challenges. For example, a medical student might be immersed in a virtual operating room, tasked with performing a complex surgical procedure. With each decision, the simulation adapts, creating a tailored environment that hones the student's skills through repetition and reactive feedback. The AI is the fulcrum of this educational revolution. It discerns the student's competency, whether they are a novice or teetering on the brink of mastery. Depending on their proficiency, the simulation unfurls a bespoke scenario, balancing the precipice of challenge with the scaffold of achievable learning objectives. The student, tasked with diagnosing a rare condition or solving a multifaceted engineering problem, becomes an active agent in their educational trajectory—the AI acting as both guide and assessor. In this system, one's first attempt at the simulation is met with the highest stakes. Just as in the capricious realm of life, where second chances are more the exception than the rule, the initial foray into the virtual scenario carries weighty implications for the student's grade. Yet, there is a cognizance and appreciation for the nature of the AI's pedagogical strategy—it illuminates the path of understanding, fostering learning while precluding the pitfalls of academic dishonesty. As for the role of educators, they no longer function as mere conduits of knowledge but evolve into architects of these complex, virtual worlds. Their expertise is rechanneled into crafting the nuances of each simulation. The teacher, recast as a programmer, imprints their acumen into the digital DNA of the simulation—each algorithm, a reflection of their understanding of the subject matter. Take, for instance, the simulation of a mock trial for law students. The instructor infuses the program with intricacies of case law, evidentiary rules, and courtroom decorum. Students navigate this simulation, building their advocacy skills and legal reasoning, their performances measured by the unwavering eye of the AI and the exacting standards set by their virtual mentor. As educators transmute their knowledge into these interactive modules, they offer more than education; they extend a legacy of expertise that students can engage with on their journey to professionalism. These digital constructs become commodities of knowledge—treasures of learning that students can harness to ascend to the zenith of their potential. When students triumph over these rigorous simulations, emerging victorious from the gauntlet of virtual challenges, they do not merely graduate. They emerge as validated professionals, their skills indelibly inscribed by the AI, a testament to their readiness to embark on careers where employers eagerly await their unique blend of theoretical knowledge and practical proficiency, assured by the credibility of their AI-sanctioned accomplishments. So proceeds the evolution of education through these virtual platforms, where the inwardly concave screen supersedes the necessity of cumbersome VR headsets and gloves. It becomes a portal to experience and a crucible for skillful mastery—a bastion of learning where the future unfurls, not within the confines of a classroom, but within the boundless potentials of virtual reality simulations, steered by the transformative power of artificial intelligence."},{"prompt":"rewrite to make it much longer in length and detailed","completion":"Imagine, if you will, a new epoch in the annals of education, one where the conventional classroom is rendered obsolete, supplanted by an arena of technological marvels where each pupil is granted their own expansive, inwardly concave screen. This is not the figment of a science fiction writer’s imagination; it is the tangible future of how we will nurture minds in the not-so-far horizon of our existence. This metamorphosis of educational practice rises from the advent of immersive virtual reality training simulations meticulously crafted and powered by the sophisticated engines of artificial intelligence technology. Let us delve deeper into these simulations—simulations that intertwine the advancement of computer intelligence with the artistry of human programming. They embody a cornerstone shift in instructional methodologies, marking a departure from the familiarity of textbooks and human-led lectures to an interactive, multi-sensory experience that closely mirrors the nuanced and unpredictable nature of life’s many challenges. A medical student, for instance, might find themself signifying the role of the lead surgeon in a high-fidelity reproduction of a time-sensitive, life-saving surgical procedure. Each decision made, each incision, and suture placed, sends ripples through the simulation, which dynamically adapts, creating custom-tailored scenarios that sharpen the student’s decision-making and clinical skills through rigorous repetition and interactive, instantaneous feedback. The artificial intelligence governing these virtual realities is nothing short of revolutionary—a pedagogical maestro capable of gauging and responding to the competency levels of its human charges. The AI discerns a student’s expertise, their learning curves, and academic needs. It modifies the complexity of simulations accordingly, tailoring scenarios and feedback that are challenging yet attainable with commitment and deliberation. Each student, engaged in their personal battle against the rigorous conditions set forth by the simulation—whether it be to solve a complex mathematical theorem, strategize in real-time on the battlefield, or generate innovative engineering solutions—becomes a crucial participant in their educational narrative, guided and critiqued by the ever-watchful AI. This vision of education prioritizes authenticity and excellence. In the inaugural attempt, students find that the grade reflective of their performance holds significant weight, mimicking the high stakes and scarcity of second chances found in the professional world. Subsequent attempts at the simulation, although certainly beneficial for grasping concepts and refining skills, are recorded with diminishing returns in terms of grading to promote a culture of getting it right the first time. This reinforces a sobering yet valuable lesson in accountability and the pursuit of excellence, instilling a mindset that prizes due diligence. Despite this, the very nature of the AI’s methodical approach to instruction—its capacity to demonstrate, review, and correct without malice—fosters a learning environment where understanding is prized and the propensity for academic deceit is significantly diminished. Educators, in this brave new world, are not marginalized but alongside the evolution of educational practice—recast as the veritable creators of the virtual landscapes that their students will navigate. Their role is redefined from direct instructors to developers and designers, channeling their domain expertise into the programming of each specialized training module. In constructing these simulations, pedagogical experts lay down the intricate layers of the curriculum within the code—turning each conceptual algorithm and programmed response into an academic legacy that can be interacted with and learned from. Consider the intricate example of crafting a simulation for law students—a virtual experience replete with the ebb and flow of an authentic trial environment. Here, the instructor morphs into a digital artisan, weaving together legal principles, judicial procedures, and the finer points of advocacy into a scenario that demands critical thinking, rapid adaptation, and strategic argumentation from its participants. Students, thus submerged, build upon their analytical prowess and develop authentic skills reflective of a seasoned practitioner, under the discerning guidance of the AI and standards established by their instructor-programmers.

Orphelin, Akio est élevé par sa grand-mère qui lui raconte des histoires des légendaires Gardiens des Éléments - de puissants guerriers capables de manipuler les forces de la nature à travers leurs affinités élémentaires. Épisode 1 commence avec la célébration du festival annuel des éléments, où les différents clans montrent leurs affinités et les jeunes sont testés pour leur potentiel en tant que futurs apprentis. Rempli d'une ardeur juvénile et d'un besoin profond de prouver qu'il est destiné à une grande mission, Akio est impatient de découvrir son affinité élémentaire, bien qu'il ait toujours été étrangement incapable de maîtriser la moindre forme de magie élémentaire. Alors que le festival bat son plein, une soudaine attaque par un groupe de mystérieux ninjas corrompus vient perturber la paix du village. Au milieu du chaos, Akio découvre par miracle qu'il peut invoquer le pouvoir du Vent, une affinité longtemps considérée comme disparue de Kazehana. Akio fait preuve d'une maîtrise surprenante pour un novice, suggérant qu'il pourrait être le réincarnation d'un puissant Gardien du Vent. Avec l'aide d'autres apprentis, et sous la tutelle de Maître Hiroshi, un ancien Gardien du Feu, Akio repousse les intrus, mais l'affrontement laisse derrière lui plus de questions que de réponses. Pourquoi ces assaillants s’intéressent-ils à Fūjin? Pourquoi Akio a-t-il débloqué une telle puissance sans entraînement préalable?

A Spaniard of towering stature with piercing blue eyes, Melissa's fair skin betrays not the scars of war but the echoes of countless victories earned through raw power and an indomitable will. Opposite her stands Mishaali, the formidable Indian warrior with tresses as dark as the night and eyes that mirror the depths of her unyielding spirit. Both carved from the stones of perseverance, these women embody the spirit of the gladiator; their sculpted physiques are monuments to the endless hours honed in the crucible of the gym. They have weathered storms of fists and tides of sweat, each battle an epic etched into their very souls. Fierce and undeniably skilled, they have clashed in the ring, on the mat, and under the unforgiving lights, each confrontation a crescendo in their storied enmity. As the whispers of their rivalry spread like wildfire, so too does the inevitable realization: it must end, and only one can stand triumphant. Hidden from the roar of the crowd and the spectacle of the arena, they seek a finality that can only come with the absence of rules, the absence of prying eyes. And so, the stage is set for a clandestine collision—a raw, unadulterated clash of pure power and passion. In the dead of night, under the ghostly luminescence of the moon, they find themselves drawn to an abandoned warehouse, a hulking skeleton of industry lost to time.

The setting is as raw and unpolished as their need to prove themselves to one another—a stage stripped of grandeur, where sweat and blood will spill freely, unhindered by the confines of competition. They honor their eternal struggle with isolation, the only witness being the unspoken respect they hold for each other amidst the raging fires of their rivalry. As the night cloaks their presence, they silently agree to the circumstance of their battle—a silent nod, an exchange of determined glances, a shared breath drawing in the dense air of anticipation.

Anonymous said on 24 June 2007 Gutted, that this wonderful shop has closed, I know the cartoon is still rerunning on CITV (and in Welsh on S4C, but we’re Scottish so who cares) but it’s never gonna be the same, The novelty of a Russian cartoon being popular in Scotland was awesome, Hopefully they do something worth while with the space. Henry commented on 01 July 2007 I was recently allowed in to see it one final time and it really is sad, the statue of Chiko would once have kids lining up to take pictures with him, the toy zone was once filled, It is such a sad time for Glasgow. Oscar Riddle commented on 01 July 2007 I know, We already lost the Odeon, then we lost Safeway to the whole Morrisons “rebrand”, Now we lost Riki. When will shops stop closing here in the UK. Honey commented on 01 July 2007 I’m still not over Safeway becoming Morrisons, So many shops close in Glasgow, When Safeway was being converted at least 13 staff members were let go, They then chose to work at Tesco for a very little while before they decided to leave supermarkets all together and instead work with children, My friend worked at Safeway and was fired during the conversion, He loved toys and so he stayed in retail, albeit working at Riki, He is now unemployed again as a result of its closure BadHairDay commented on 05 July 2007 CITV airings of KikoRiki have had an announcement targeted to Scottish viewers saying “Although you can no longer get merchandise of this show from the shop in Glasgow, you can now buy it online or at your local retailer”, CITV have also pre-empted Squish, My Parents are Aliens, Pokemon and Horrid Henry in favour of a KikoRiki marathon this Summer, BadHairDay commented on 22 November 2007 Glasgow switched on their Christmas lights earlier tonight and they had it switched on by none other than the characters from KikoRiki, It was great, I wonder if the costumes used there are the same ones they used to use in Riki? EDIT: It is confirmed it was. End posted on 24 January 2009 Sorry to bump the thread but Toonattik (CITV’s morning show) was today held inside the former Riki Shop, The hosts said it was because CITV were holding a KikoRiki marathon later that day and they wanted to “celebrate it in a perfect way”, Surreal to see the place lit up again after being lifeless for more than a year. I’ve sent in a video “file:ToonattikatRiki.mp4”, They played all the usual Toonattik games, including the “pie in the face” ending, They said they aren’t cleaning it up because “the place is closed so no one will notice”, Funny stuff Universal Credit posted on 26 June 2009 It appears that they are going to use the space for a “new studio” for Toonattik, Wonder how STV will feel about ITV using a studio in their area, Shame to see the remnants go Oio posted on 13 January 2010 The plans have been rejected by the council due to opposition from STV who say that it opens the door for “the end of STV and ITV taking over Scotland”, Sad to see it decaying but I guess that’s how things end. Rip10thDoctor posted on 09 May 2010 Toonattik ended this morning with a song and dance about how our toons are still gonna be here, Although the shows finished the brand is gonna carry on, just without the live show or Jamie and Anna, They’re adding Horrid Henry, Planet Sketch and of course our beloved KikoRiki to the lineup of the “new” Toonattik, Can’t help but wonder if the death of the real Toonattik was STV’s fault Josh Atkinson posted on 19 July 2010 Huge shame about this! A store that truly was one of the main reasons i was able to pick up most of my toys and games from Glasgow, It is sad it has been closed for 3 years, We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on the CITV channel (it managed to survive the late 2009 rebrand that got Bratz, Four Eyes! and Wow! Wow! Wubbzy! removed from the channel to make room for more Horrid Henry) It still rates very well with 6 million viewers, But they really need to do something worthwhile with the space, Maybe just re-open it as a toy shop or something like that, I still walk by it, and I still tear up at the devastated image of Krash. Kluskowski posted on 05 January 2011 Pop are now airing GoGoRiki, the other English dub of Smeshariki, How this will compete with KikoRiki on CITV remains to be seen, I am also disappointed they haven’t found a tenant for Riki, During its final 2 years it became as iconic as the Pavilion Theatre and Barrowlands. It was even popular in Smeshariki’s native Russia, I remember them opening a Pики store in Moscow in 2005 modeled after the Glasgow Riki store, The Riki days were way more exciting than the Golden Adventure ones User1 posted on 15 February 2013 Can you believe it has been six years since Riki closed? I still walk past it occasionally, and it’s just heartbreaking to see the state it’s in now. The closure notice is covered in graffiti, and the sign is decaying, but the “Goodbye forever” and crying Krash remain intact. It’s like a haunting reminder of what once was. User2 replied on 16 February 2013 I know, it’s truly a tragic sight. It breaks my heart every time I see it. I can’t believe the city has let it deteriorate like this. It’s STV’s fault for keeping it vacant and killing off the real Toonattik. They could have done something worthwhile with the space, but instead, it’s become a symbol of neglect. User3 commented on 18 February 2013 I agree, it’s such a shame. Riki was a beloved store in Glasgow, and now it’s just a shell of its former self. I remember taking my kids there and seeing their faces light up with joy. We still have the KikoRiki cartoon on CITV, but it’s not the same without the store. I really wish something could be done to revive it. User4 replied on 20 February 2013 I remember the good old days when the store was thriving. It was a place full of life, excitement and happiness. Now, it’s nothing but a sad reminder of what once was. I can’t help but feel angry at STV for forcing its continued dormancy. They need to take responsibility for their actions and make it right. User5 commented on 22 February 2013 It’s a shame that Riki had to close, but we can’t solely blame STV for its demise. STV didnt cause the closure, but they moaned at ITV for wanting to move Toonattik in the space, in fear that ITV would take over STV and introduce ITV1 branding for Scotland, The realities of retail and the changing shopping landscape played a significant role. However, I do believe that more could have been done to find a solution or repurpose the space. It’s a missed opportunity, and it’s disheartening to see it in such a state. User1 replied on 25 February 2013 You’re right, User5. The changing retail landscape definitely had an impact, but I can’t help but feel that if STV had been more supportive, Riki could have found a way to adapt and thrive. It’s frustrating to see the space go to waste when it could have been utilized for something meaningful. I miss the energy and joy that Riki brought to the community. User3 commented on 27 February 2013 I recently showed my kids a picture I took of them in front of Riki when they were little. Seeing their faces light up with nostalgia was bittersweet. We can’t change the past, but I do hope that one day, something worthwhile will take its place. Glasgow deserves a vibrant and exciting space that can capture the spirit Riki had. User2 replied on 02 March 2013 I completely agree, User3. It’s time for the city and the community to come together and find a solution. Riki may be gone, but its legacy lives on in the hearts of those who experienced its magic. Let’s continue to remember the joy it brought and work towards creating something just as special. Goodbye forever, Riki. User1 posted on 10 December 2022 I had the most bittersweet experience today. After years of abandonment, I was finally allowed to enter the old Riki store. As I stepped inside, memories flooded back, and I couldn’t help but tear up. I miss taking my kids here so much. User2 replied on 11 December 2022 Oh, User1, I can only imagine how emotional that must have been for you. Riki was such a special place for many of us. Did you notice if anything had changed inside? User1 commented on 12 December 2022 Honestly, User2, it was both heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time. The store remained frozen in time, with all the zones dedicated to specific characters still intact. Krash’s Fun Zone, Pin's Creativity Corner, and Chiko’s Friendship Garden were all there, reminding me of the joy my kids experienced in each area. User3 replied on 14 December 2022 That sounds incredible, User1. It’s almost like a time capsule of the past. But it’s also a stark reminder of what we’ve lost. Riki was a vibrant place that brought so much joy to the community. I miss taking my kids there too. It’s a shame it had to close. User1 commented on 16 December 2022 Yes, User3, it truly is a shame. But I’m grateful for the opportunity to step back into that world, even if it’s just for a moment. I couldn’t help but reflect on how much has changed since Riki closed. CITV has premiered new shows over the years, (namely the infamous Teen Titans Go!), and even Horrid Henry moved to Nickelodeon ages ago. However, the KikoRiki cartoon is still going strong on CITV. It’s the last remnant of the old CITV, and it’s surprising how well it’s doing. User4 replied on 18 December 2022 It’s amazing to see the enduring popularity of KikoRiki. It’s a testament to the quality of the show and the love it received from viewers. I’m glad it’s still bringing joy to children, even if the physical store is no longer here. And you mentioned the closure notice. It’s interesting how, every time someone vandalizes it, it gets cleaned up. It’s like a symbol of resilience, how the spirit of Riki refuses to be forgotten. User1 replied on 20 December 2022 Exactly, User4. No matter how neglected the store may appear from the outside, the resilience and love Riki brought to the community still shine through. I hope that one day a new generation will experience that magic in a new way. Until then, I’ll hold onto the memories and continue to cherish the joy that Riki brought to my family. Goodbye forever, Riki - you will be missed. Rhehe posted on 23 October 2023 The day we've all been dreading is approaching, Plans have been submitted to the council to demolish Riki, I feel sad that a piece of my childhood is facing the wrecking ball, but I kinda feel glad for the store because it has been neglected for well over a decade, and it can finally rest in peace, Rest well old friend, your long struggle is almost over, so long Riki, so long User1 posted on 23 October 2023 \\"The old Riki store in Sauchiehall Street is being demolished. The building has fallen into disrepair since the store closed over 15 years ago\\" 😢 It's sad to see it go, But let's remember all the good times we had there when it was open, not how it sat empty and lonely for so long, Hopefully whatever is built there will remember it well. Goodbye old friend, BadHairDay posted on 28 October 2023 This is good news for greedy developers, but bad news for us who went there when we were kids. RIP old friend! I hope we can all do something special to remember it well, I am taking a final picture of the crying Krash image, But at least he is still happy and cheerful in the show. User1 posted on 01 November 2023 Can you believe it? The old Riki store is still standing! Demolition plans for the building were recently rejected by the council, citing “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent Henrik’s department store. It’s a small victory for those of us who hold fond memories of Riki and its impact on the community. User2 replied on 03 November 2023 That’s incredible news, User1! I can’t believe the old Riki store has managed to hold on for so long. It really goes to show how much love and support it still has from the community. I’m glad the council recognized the value of preserving this piece of Glasgow’s history. User3 commented on 05 November 2023 This is such a relief. Riki may be closed, but its physical presence still holds so much meaning for many of us. It’s heartwarming to see the council prioritize the preservation of this beloved spot. Perhaps one day, we can find a way to repurpose the space and bring new life to it while still honoring Riki’s legacy. User4 replied on 07 November 2023 I’m thrilled to hear that the old Riki store will remain standing. It’s a testament to the impact it had on the community and the memories it created. Preserving this piece of history is so important, and I hope the council and the community can come together to find a worthwhile purpose for the space. Riki may be gone, but its spirit lives on. User1 commented on 09 November 2023 I couldn’t agree more, User4. The old Riki store may no longer be the bustling children’s shop it once was, but its presence still holds so much meaning. I can’t help but feel hopeful for what the future holds for this space. Perhaps it can become a hub for creativity, community events, or even a museum dedicated to the legacy of Riki. The possibilities are endless, and I’m excited to see what unfolds. User2 replied on 12 November 2023 I love your ideas, User1! A hub for creativity or a museum dedicated to Riki would be incredible. It would not only preserve the memories of what was but also provide a space for new adventures and experiences. The community deserves a place to gather and celebrate the joy that Riki brought to our lives. Let’s keep the hope alive and continue to advocate for the revitalization of this special spot. User3 commented on 15 November 2023 I’m fully on board with these ideas, User1 and User2. A space dedicated to fostering creativity and preserving Riki’s legacy would be a wonderful addition to the community. It would not only honor the past but also inspire future generations. Let’s keep the conversation going and work towards making this vision a reality. The old Riki store deserves to be more than a nostalgic reminder. User1 posted on 18 November 2023 Good news, everyone! I managed to find out what would have been built in place of the old Riki store if the demolition plans had been approved. It turns out that the proposed project was a generic office building, nothing particularly exciting or unique. I can’t help but feel relieved that this outcome was avoided. User2 replied on 20 November 2023 Wow, User1, that’s quite a disappointment. The thought of a generic office building replacing the beloved Riki store is disheartening. It further emphasizes the importance of preserving the memories and spirit of Riki. It’s clear that the community deserves something much more special and meaningful. User3 commented on 22 November 2023 I can’t help but feel a sense of gratitude that the demolition plans were rejected. The fact that a generic office building was proposed only reinforces the importance of preserving our community’s history and identity. Riki brought joy and excitement to Glasgow, and it deserves to be honored in a way that reflects its impact. User4 replied on 25 November 2023 Thank goodness the plans for a generic office building fell through! I was worried that the area would become an ordinary office plaza. Ejej replied on 26 November 2023 I think offices are good, somewhere else, Build it where BHS is, Anywhere else but not in this space. Incidentally there is a grafitti piece at the old shop next to the closure notice that says \\"You're safe, We almost lost you\\" Man19 replied on 27 November 2023 Here is a newspaper article \\"Glasgow’s Cherished Riki Store Demolition Plans Denied Protection of Heritage and Community Outcry Save Landmark from Becoming Modern Office Building Glasgow, United Kingdom – The iconic former Riki store, which has been a fixture in the heart of Glasgow’s bustling Sauchiehall Street, was the subject of hot debate as city officials considered proposals for its demolition to make way for a new office building. However, a significant decision arrived this week as the council emphatically rejected the demolition plans. Established in 1995 as Golden Adventures toy shop and later rebranded as Riki, the store was a beacon of childhood joy, attracting families and children with its unique offering of merchandise related to the KikoRiki animated series. Despite closing its doors in 2007, the shop has held a place in the hearts of Glaswegians who continued to cherish their memories of the location. The announcement of possible demolition sent waves of concern through the community, sparking an outcry from preservationists and locals alike. Campaigners argued that the Riki store was more than just a shop but a cultural landmark that represented a specific era in Glasgow’s commercial landscape and childhood nostalgia. Developers pitched a new vision for the location, one involving the creation of a modern office building intended to revitalize the neighborhood’s economic viability. “While change and development are necessary for a city’s growth, we must be cautious not to erase the essence of what makes Glasgow so special,” explained local historian Fiona McCallum. “Riki was a place of wonder, and its architecture is part of what parents and former children remember fondly.” After weeks of heated discussion and review, the city’s planning council came to a decision. Citing not only the potential “unnecessary destruction” to the adjacent, well-loved Henrik’s department store, but also a commitment to preserving Glasgow’s unique history and social fabric, the demolition application has been officially denied. “We have a responsibility to consider the implications of development on our built heritage. Demolishing the old Riki store would have not only caused damage to adjacent properties but would have also eradicated an intrinsic part of our collective memory,” stated a member of the planning council. In the wake of this verdict, the community rejoices at the saved landmark. Social media buzzed with memories and anecdotes, emphasizing the personal connections many hold with the once vibrant toy store. The decision to prevent demolition has been celebrated as a victory for heritage and a win for a city fiercely proud of its past. With the preservation of the site now confirmed, discussions have begun anew regarding the future of the vacant Riki store. Proposals for cultural projects and community spaces have been tabled, suggesting a second life for the beloved former shop. As Glasgow looks forward, it seems determined to do so by embracing, not erasing, the stories of its storied streets. For now, locals and visitors to Sauchiehall Street can rest assured that the building that once housed the joy of Riki continues to stand against the backdrop of a modernizing Glasgow, remaining a piece of living history. Update: Amidst public pressure and the verdict to deny demolition based on potential damage to neighboring premises, the support of community preservation has inspired a renewed focus on the site’s importance as a cultural touchstone to be celebrated and repurposed thoughtfully.

They shouldn't have closed it. My kids would have loved it as they are big fans of the cartoon User5 posted on 27 November 2023 I can’t help but recall how after Riki closed, the KikoRiki characters kept showing up around the city. It was like they weren’t ready to leave us just yet. There were character appearances at events, and they continued to be a part of Glasgow’s cultural scene, delighting kids and those of us who remembered them from the store’s golden days. User2 replied on 28 November 2023 Yes, User5, I remember those appearances fondly. It always brought a smile to my face to see Krash or Chiko around town. But it seemed like they slowly began to fade from the public eye as the late 2010s approached. I’ve noticed they’ve been popping up more recently, though. Maybe it’s a sign of a resurgence in popularity or perhaps a tribute to our collective nostalgia for the Riki days? User1 commented on 30 November 2023 It’s definitely been bittersweet to see the characters around. They’ve become so much more than just mascots; they’re symbols of a joyful time in Glasgow’s history. With their increased appearances lately, it feels like a comforting reminder of the store. Maybe they’ll have a more permanent place in the city again. User3 replied on 02 December 2023 Those appearances were a big deal. I also think STV’s resistance to ITV’s Toonattik moving into the Riki space had long-lasting effects. Toonattik was such a big part of our Saturday mornings, and when it was downscaled in May 2010, it changed the landscape of children’s television. It felt like the end of an era, right alongside the closure of Riki. User6 posted on 02 December 2023 It’s sad to think about how much influence STV had over the situation. Toonattik could have experienced a new chapter within the old Riki store, bringing life back into that space and giving us more time with our beloved characters. In hindsight, the whole debacle had a domino effect on children’s programming and our local community feeling. User4 replied on 02 December 2023 There was a missed opportunity there, for sure. Having a television show like Toonattik based in the Riki store could’ve possibly saved both the show and the space from becoming just a memory. But that period of uncertainty for Riki and Toonattik also shows how much passion and love there was for both. It just makes their absence sting a little more. User7 commented on 02 December 2023 It’s interesting how these characters still have a presence around town after all this time. It just goes to show how strong of a connection they made with us all. Hopefully, their reemergence means that we can find new and exciting ways to celebrate them and the Riki legacy. Maybe even inspire future projects that can benefit from this rich cultural history. User8 replied on 04 December 2023 I’ve been thinking about the future of that space and the characters of KikoRiki. Perhaps we could have a multi-purpose community center with a dedicated section for KikoRiki history? Imagine combining nostalgia with new experiences for children and families—workshops, play areas, exhibits. Let’s hope the community and council can be creative with this beloved space. Title: Goodbye Riki: Remembering the Final Day at Glasgow’s Childhood Wonderland It’s been years since the doors of Glasgow’s beloved Riki store closed for the last time, but the memories still linger as vividly as if it were yesterday. Tucked away on Sauchiehall Street, the store was not just a shop; it was a delightful haven where imagination came to life and where the vibrant characters of KikoRiki became part of our city’s heart. Today, as the future of that once animated space hangs in the balance, I find myself reflecting on the final day Riki opened its doors—a day that marked the end of an era. The air had a distinct heaviness as the familiar sound of laughter and chatter that once filled Riki’s colorful aisles was replaced with a somber silence. You could feel the nostalgia enveloping every corner of the shop, grappling with a sense of farewell that we all knew was inevitable but hoped would never come. Krash the Rabbit, who typically bounded about with joy and mischief, now shed a tear, immortalized in the poignant image that bade us all ‘Goodbye forever…’ The bright shelves that radiated with KikoRiki merchandise now stood less vibrant, echoing the end of what had been a magical adventure for kids—and let’s admit, for adults too. There was a comforting reassurance as the shop’s speakers played a heartfelt message, expressing genuine gratitude for the years of patronage, reminding us that we were part of their journey, from the Golden Adventures’ inception to the triumphant rise of Riki. Amid the deals and the last-minute purchases, a layer of solemnity blanketed the vibrant colors that once denoted fun and excitement. As the final half-hour approached, the tannoy announcement looped, filled with heartfelt thanks and a subtle reminder that though Riki’s physical presence would soon be no more, the characters would continue to thrive on CITV and the virtual expanses of RolyPolyLand. Yet, nothing could mask the finality that hung in the air—the store felt like a castle that was preparing to lower its flag for the last time. At closing time, the sense of loss became tangible. The staff, who had become as much a part of the store’s fabric as the toys they sold, shared looks that didn’t require words. Their smiles, although reassuring, hinted at the uncertainty that lay ahead. The last announcement came—a soft, courteous farewell, followed by a somber tune that felt like a lullaby for the childhood dreams cultivated within those walls. Walking away from Riki for the final time, the once-buzzing shop lay dormant, with dimming lights that signaled the end of an enchanting age. It wasn’t just a shop that was closing—it was a part of us, a fragment of Glasgow’s community tapestry, that was vanishing. Today, as the site stands stagnant, with the Riki store merely a memory encased behind timeworn signs and faded caricatures, the legacy persists in the heartbeats of those who remember. We keep alive the spirit of joy and imagination that Riki bestowed upon us, evident in every recollection shared, every story recounted of a place that was so much more than a store. In a way, Riki’s enduring impact is akin to the tales it once harbored—a story without an end, characters who continue to adventure in the minds they’ve touched, and a magic that, though distant, refuses to be extinguished. So here’s to Riki: our childhood wonderland, our trove of joy, our cherished slice of Glasgow that gleamed brightly, if only for a while. Goodbye forever, Riki—you may be gone, but you’re far from forgotten. Write a forum post where a user provides a recording of the final minute, including the farewell and sombre lullaby, as the “Goodbye Forever” sign is put up Title: A Last Goodbye: Riki Store’s Final Minute Recording User: RememberingRiki Hey Glasgow community, I’m not sure if any of you were as taken by Riki as I was, but witnessing the closure of our beloved children’s shop, the one place that seemed to be made of pure childhood magic, was profoundly emotional for so many of us. As a long-time visitor of the Riki store and a father who experienced the wonder in my children’s eyes with each visit, I felt compelled to capture the last moments of the store—a bittersweet farewell to a piece of our city’s identity. On that final day, as the clock ticked towards the inevitable end of an era, I stood there with my phone out, recording the last minute of Riki and all the poignant emotions it encompassed. As the final announcement played over the speakers, I watched tearfully as the staff put up the now-infamous “Goodbye Forever…” sign featuring Krash the Rabbit’s crying image. The shop that was once brimming with the energetic buzz of excited children and the vibrant colors of KikoRiki characters was silent, save for the tender voice thanking us for years of memories, promising that while the store was closing, the characters we cherished would continue to live on screens and in hearts all around Glasgow. As the voice trailed off with a warm “Take care, wherever you are,” a pre-recorded sombre lullaby began to play, filling the space with a profound sense of loss and nostalgia—a final tribute to the joy and wonderment that Riki brought into our lives. Amidst the gentle melody, the lights started to dim, one by one, as if the store itself was bidding us farewell. I’m sharing the recording here for all of those who couldn’t be there or might want to reminisce about the magic one last time. [File: RikiStoreFinalMinute.mp3] It’s not easy to listen to, but perhaps it can serve as a collective piece of solace, a shared moment of remembrance for what Riki once was to us. Listening to it now, it’s hard to believe that the laughter and footsteps that once echoed through those walls have faded. But in times like these, when all that’s left is a quiet space behind a locked door, it’s these recordings, these memories, that keep the spirit of Riki alive. Thank you, Riki, for being more than just a store. You were a part of our Glaswegian story, a chapter of innocence and joy in the book of our bustling city. May the essence of what you represented shine long after your lights have dimmed. Goodnight, Riki. RememberingRiki Write a blog post during a 2023 Christmas event where George Bowie starts singing random songs (namely Never Gonna Give You Up, Rasputin and I Can't Decide) This leads to him being denied the honor of switching on the Christmas lights, and instead a familiar friend (dressed in a Santa outfit) switches them on and opens the Winterfest fair","completion":"Title: A Festive Twist: The Unforgettable 2023 Glasgow Winterfest Greetings, festive friends! It's that most wonderful time of the year again when the twinkling lights, merry carols, and the scent of mulled wine fills the air in Glasgow. The 2023 Winterfest event promised to be an unforgettable evening, and trust me, it did not disappoint—especially not with George Bowie's unexpected musical detour. It was a crisp evening in George Square, the crowd gathered eagerly for the highlight of the season—the switch-on of the Christmas lights. Excitement bubbled as George Bowie, the beloved Glaswegian DJ known for whipping crowds into a frenzy, took to the stage to kick things off. But as the music started, it wasn't the jolly jingles of Christmas we were met with; instead, George decided to throw us all for a loop with a medley of the most random songs you could imagine. The iconic opening synth of 'Never Gonna Give You Up' rickrolled through the speakers, and a murmur of amused confusion spread among us. Before we could recover, 'Rasputin' with its thumping disco beats had us jokingly dancing the Russian jig, and 'I Can't Decide,' with its upbeat tempo but grim lyrics, had everyone raising an eyebrow in bewildered delight. George was serenading us in the most George Bowie way possible—not with carols but with the tunes that seemed to epitomize his unpredictable and fun-loving spirit. It was impossible not to laugh and join in the unexpected fun. However, the night was about tradition and festive cheer, and the organizers couldn't help but feel that the Christmas spirit had been, shall we say, slightly hijacked by this impromptu Bowie party. So, with a gentle nudge and a jolly chuckle, they steered the event back on course. The honor of switching on the lights, they announced, would go to someone else. The crowd buzzed with curiosity—who could possibly step in after such an unpredictable start? And then, out of the cold, night air came the sound of sleigh bells, and onto the stage waltzed a most familiar and beloved figure, clad in a plush Santa suit. It was none other than Krash the Rabbit from the legendary Riki store! The applause was instantaneous, the cheer immense; what better way to reignite the festive spirit than with a character that had been a part of Glasgow's Christmases for years? Krash, with his usual animated flair, danced about the stage, waving to the children whose faces were lit up with recognition and delight. With a hearty \\"Ho Ho Ho!\\" and a flick of a giant, candy-striped switch, the square exploded into a dazzling display of lights. It was as if the magic of every childhood Christmas had been distilled into this one perfect moment. The cheers echoed, the music swelled into classic Christmas tunes, and the Winterfest fair officially opened, ushering in the season's joy. Stalls adorned with twinkling lights served hot cocoa and festive treats. Rides spun with the laughter of thrill-seekers, and the ice rink shimmered under the lights—colors reflecting in the smooth, icy canvas. The night continued with a wholesomeness unmatched, glowing faces everywhere you looked, and Krash the Rabbit at the center of it all, giving the city a jolt of pure, nostalgic bliss that tied back to the Riki days. This Winterfest will be remembered not just for the surprise selection of songs from George Bowie, but for the city's enduring love for a character that represents the joy and innocence of childhood. As the evening drew to a close, we were all reminded that sometimes, the most unexpected turns lead to the most heartwarming of destinations. May your festive season be just as surprising and joy-filled. Goodnight, Glasgow. May the spirit of Riki and the laughter of Winterfest warm your hearts this Christmas and always."},{"prompt":"Write a follow up in the new year where the closure notice is finally taken down, but no redevelopment happens, Instead, a miracle happens, a grand reopening, This even causes STV to pre-empt the ITV programming for a marathon of the show","completion":"Title: New Year, New Beginnings: The Unexpected Revival of Glasgow’s Riki Store As the remnants of yuletide cheer began to fade and the new year took hold, the poignant sight of the Riki store closure notice—once a sorrowful fixture on Sauchiehall Street—was finally removed. The weathered sign had become something of a landmark, a touchstone for the collective nostalgia of the Glasgow community. But with the start of 2023 came change, sweeping through the city with the crisp winter air. For years, whispers of redevelopment had ebbed and flowed, sparking hope only to fade once more into silence. Yet the storefront remained untouched, a lingering testament to the beloved Riki era, until one clear January morning when the paper notice was peeled away, revealing the long-darkened windows behind it. The community braced for the hum of construction crews and the birth of something new in the old Riki store's place. But the anticipated noise never came; there was no clamor of demolition, no scaffolds rising—only quiet expectation. It seemed the space would continue to stand vacant, another empty chapter to its tale. Then, one unexpected day, \\"the miracle on Sauchiehall Street\\" occurred. Without fanfare, without a whisper of warning, vibrant posters colored the storefront, and a sign appeared as if delivered by the hands of nostalgia itself: \\"Grand Reopening: The Riki Store Returns!\\" Disbelief rippled through the city. Could it be? Was the cherished cornerstone of childhood really coming back to life? It seemed impossible, yet there it was, a grand declaration of rebirth plastered for all to see. The news spread like wildfire, a spark of excitement that Glasgow hadn't felt in over a decade. And as if in celebration of this remarkable return, STV made an extraordinary announcement. For one weekend only, they would preempt their regular ITV programming for an exclusive KikoRiki marathon. Reminiscent of the show's golden days, the cartoon that once captured the hearts of a generation would dance across the screens once more, a fitting homage to the wondrous happenings down on Sauchiehall Street. On the day of the grand reopening, a line snaked around the block, a sea of faces young and old, all waiting to step once again into a world they thought lost to time. When the doors swung open, it was as if they were crossing a threshold into the past—a space once vital, now vibrant once more. The store was a mosaic of old and new: shelves laden with cherished KikoRiki merchandise, walls adorned with scenes of their animated adventures, and interactive zones buzzing with the laughter and gaiety of a new generation of fans. The air was electric, the joy palpable, a celebration not just of a store's return but of the community it represented. As Krakish the Rabbit—a symbol of the store's spirit—danced through the aisles, children followed, enchanted. It was a scene pulled from the depths of a dream, breathing life back into the heart of Glasgow. For those who had walked these aisles in their youth, it was a homecoming; for the newer faces, it was the discovery of an instant classic. Social media buzzed with snippets of the marathon and live feeds from the reopening; Glasgow lit up with an old flame rekindled. That weekend, families basked in the nostalgia-laden glow, a shared experience that transcended age and time. And so, the Riki store—once a shuttered emblem of changing times—began anew, a testament to the enduring magic of childhood wonder. It was a promise kept by a community that held tight to memories, refusing to let them slip away into obscurity. As the lights of the KikoRiki marathon dimmed and STV returned to its regular programming, there was a collective sense of contentment. Glasgow had reclaimed a piece of its identity, and the notion that some stories truly can find their way back to us was cemented in the hearts of all who had been part of this remarkable revival. The year may be new, but the spirit of the Riki store is timeless. Welcome back, dear friend. May your doors remain open and your legacy continue to inspire joy for generations to come."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom...)

One beautiful sunny morning, Krash, the energetic pink KikoRiki, decided to organize a treasure hunt for his friends. Excited by the idea, Krash spent the morning drawing a map that led to a secret spot he found in the Whispering Woods, where he had hidden a chest filled with delicious fruit—nature's treasure. With the map in hand, he dashed over to Wally’s house to share the plan. Wally, the intellectual and often pensive yellow KikoRiki, suggested they add some riddles to the treasure hunt for an extra challenge. Krash loved the idea and together, they quickly came up with clever clues to guide their friends. The two friends gathered the rest of the gang: Barry, Olga, Dokko, Chiko, Pin, and Rosy, to announce the treasure hunt. Krash handed out copies of the map, and Wally explained the riddles that were to be solved at key points on the trail. They set off in pairs, navigating the lush landscapes of KikoRiki. Barry, the strong and blue creature, paired with the dreamy and artistic Rosy. Olga, the nurturing and motherly orange KikoRiki, joined the inventive and curious Pin, while Chiko, the green wannabe-hero, teamed up with Dokko, the wise and purple elder. Laughter and joy echoed through the hills and valleys as each pair deciphered Wally's riddles, finding that the true fun lay not in the treasure itself, but in the shared moments of discovery. They helped each other over streams, through thickets, and across meadows, learning about their strengths and weaknesses. At the end of the trail, in a glade rimmed with twinkling flowers, the chest awaited, but it was locked with a final puzzle. Excitedly, the KikoRikis put their heads together, realizing this last challenge required a piece of knowledge that each one of them had shared during the journey. With a joyful click, the lock opened, revealing not only the promised fruit but also little handmade medals created by Krash, each inscribed with a trait the KikoRiki had shown that day: Teamwork, Creativity, Wisdom, and Courage. As they sat and snacked on the sweet fruit, the KikoRikis understood that the greatest treasures were their friendships and the experiences they shared. They laughed and chatted until the sun dipped low, weaving a new memory into the rich tapestry of life in KikoRiki."},{"prompt":"(In the school literature clubroom...)

Nick Wilde goes to investigate with Judy Hopps, and they discover that Duke Weaselton has monopolized the coffee market for \\"the lols\\". Judy and Nick arrest Duke, but...they don't know why Duke took over the whole coffee market...for...meme culture, they guess?","completion":"Nick Wilde's morning could only begin one way: with the rich, bold aroma of a freshly brewed 'Savage Roast' - his favorite coffee in all of Zootopia. It was the kind of kick needed to jumpstart the day for a sly fox-turned-cop, especially when partnered with a bunny as unrelentingly energetic as Judy Hopps. This morning, Nick strolled up to the drive-thru window of Clawbucks with a smooth strut, eager to wrap his paws around the steaming cup of caffeinated bliss. \\"Good morning!\\" he greeted, prepping his most disarming smile for the barista. \\"Morning, Officer Wilde,\\" the rather drowsy sloth behind the window replied, taking his sweet time. \\"But I've got bad news...we're out of coffee.\\" \\"No coffee? As in... none?\\" Nick blinked incredulously, his smile faltering. None in the whole city,\\" the sloth droned, unfazed by the catastrophe, \\"...supply truck never came.\\" That's when a bolt of panic zipped through Nick, like a squirrel on an electric wire. He darted back to the precinct, snatching Judy on his way for a coffee crisis meeting. \\"Carrots, can you believe this? The city’s dry! Kaput! No java, no joe, no jitter juice!\\" Nick rambled, trying to maintain his composure. Judy, looking as caffeine-deprived as Nick felt, responded with an uncharacteristically laconic, \\"Huh.\\" With the buzz of a city devoid of buzz hanging heavy, Nick and Judy were determined to solve the mystery. They followed a trail of sleepy, grumbling mammals and discarded 'I Can't Bear The Mornings Without My Coffee' tumblers. The trail, high on the scent of desperation and withdrawal, led them straight to none other than Duke Weaselton, Zootopia's most notoriously petty criminal. As it turned out, Duke had so much 'Beanagains' going on, he'd managed to reroute every coffee delivery in Zootopia to a warehouse full of hipster weasels buzzing around like bees in a honeypot. \\"Stop right there, Duke!\\" Judy snapped, cuffing the weasel who was all too caffeinated to be scared. \\"Whoa, ease up, Hopps. I was just having a bit of fun, \\" Duke sneered, not seeing the gravity of his offense, \\"For the lols, ya know?\\" \\"Yeah, coffee monopoly 'for the lols', you’re gonna be the king of memes behind bars,\\" Nick retorted, trying to piece together the mess. In the interrogation room, Duke was vibrating so hard from all the coffee he could have started a new energy company. \\"It's all about meme culture!\\" he insisted. \\"Think about it! I’ll be a legend – 'Duke, the java jester', 'the brew mastermind', 'the decaffeinator'!\\" Judy and Nick exchanged glances, confusion mixing with the onset of caffeine headaches. This coffee caper had spiraled into the surreal. While the Chief shook his head in disbelief – not at the crime, but at the bizarre motivation behind it – Nick concocted the ultimate deal. \\"All right, Duke. Spill the beans. You supply the city with coffee, and maybe we knock a few months off your sentence,\\" Nick proffered, scratching his itch for a cunning deal. Duke, with the twitch of an eye, agreed. It wasn't the meme fame he had hoped for, but at least he could be the beano-factor of Zootopia's morning routine. In no time, Zootopia was once again buzzing with satisfaction. Cafes flowed with lattes, and streets lined with perkier pedestrians. All who had doubted the importance of a good brew were now believers, and it was all thanks to the finest (and most fox-like) detectives. As for Nick and Judy, sitting with their morning cups, they mused over the absurdity of the case that could only unfold in Zootopia's brew-tacular jungle. “For the lols, indeed,” Nick pondered, sipping his long-awaited 'Savage Roast'. \\"Let's never do that again,\\" Judy agreed, her ear perking up with each sip.

Puede ser más ligera o más pesada que las demás, pero a simple vista no se puede distinguir. Con la ayuda de una balanza de dos platillos (sin pesas, es decir, solo comparando el peso de las monedas entre sí), debes encontrar la moneda falsa y determinar si es más ligera o más pesada que las demás en solo 3 pesadas. Aquí está la solución: **Pesada 1:** Divide las monedas en tres grupos de 4. Pon dos grupos en la balanza (Grupo A y Grupo B). Si la balanza se equilibra, significa que la moneda falsa está en el tercer grupo que no se pesó (Grupo C). Si no se equilibra, sabrás que la moneda falsa está en uno de los grupos en la balanza, y si se inclina hacia un lado, sabrás si la moneda es más ligera o más pesada. **Pesada 2:** a) Si en la primera pesada la balanza se equilibra, toma el Grupo C y divide estas 4 monedas en dos pares. Pesa un par contra el otro. Si se equilibra, la moneda falsa es una de las dos que no se pesaron. Si no se equilibra, tienes el par que contiene la moneda falsa y sabes si es más ligera o más pesada. b) Si en la primera pesada la balanza no se equilibra, toma las 4 monedas del lado de la balanza que se inclinó (si la moneda es más pesada) o del lado que se levantó (si la moneda es más ligera). De estas 4 monedas, aparta 3 y coloca una en cada platillo, dejando la tercera fuera. Si se inclina hacia un lado, tendrás la moneda falsa y sabrás si es más ligera o más pesada. Si se equilibra, la moneda falsa es la que dejaste fuera, y ya sabes su peso relativo por la primera pesada. **Pesada 3:** De las dos o tres monedas que quedaron tras la segunda pesada, elige dos y pésalas entre sí. Si una es falsa, la balanza se inclinará y te dirá cuál es y si es más ligera o más pesada. Si se equilibran, la moneda falsa es la que no pusiste en la balanza, y ya sabes su peso relativo por la pesada previa. Con este método, en tres pesadas puedes determinar cuál es la moneda falsa y si es más ligera o más pesada que las demás."},{"prompt":"tipos de pensamientos","completion":"El pensamiento humano es extremadamente diverso y complejo, y existen varias formas de clasificar los tipos de pensamiento según distintos criterios. Aquí hay algunas categorías comunes para describir diferentes tipos de pensamiento: 1. **Pensamiento Convergente y Divergente:** - **Convergente:** Busca la solución más efectiva a un problema basándose en la lógica y el conocimiento disponible. Se asocia con la capacidad de dar la \\"respuesta correcta\\". - **Divergente:** Genera soluciones creativas a un problema creando muchas posibles respuestas. Se asocia con la creatividad y la innovación. 2. **Pensamiento Crítico y Reflexivo:** - **Crítico:** Evalúa argumentos y afirmaciones con escepticismo y lógica para identificar falacias o incoherencias y determinar la validez de una conclusión. - **Reflexivo:** Implica una consideración detallada y cuidadosa de un tema o idea, a menudo contemplando diferentes ángulos y perspectivas. 3. **Pensamiento Abstracto y Concreto:** - **Abstracto:** Habilidad para entender conceptos que no están vinculados con situaciones físicas concretas, permitiendo la generalización y el entendimiento de ideas complejas. - **Concreto:** Se centra en lo tangible y real, comprendiendo lo que se puede verificar directamente a través de la experiencia sensorial. 4. **Pensamiento Analítico y Sintético:** - **Analítico:** Descompone la información en partes más pequeñas para examinar los detalles y entender los componentes y estructuras de una situación o problema. - **Sintético:** Complementario al analítico, este tipo de pensamiento reúne elementos distintos para formar un todo coherente, a menudo llegando a nuevas conclusiones o conceptos. 5. **Pensamiento Lateral:** - Mira los problemas desde perspectivas únicas, empleando un enfoque más creativo que el pensamiento lógico lineal. A menudo se usa para resolver problemas de manera innovadora. 6. **Pensamiento Estratégico:** - Involucra la planificación a largo plazo y la anticipación de posibles futuros para tomar decisiones que nos acerquen a objetivos o metas deseados. 7. **Pensamiento Deductivo, Inductivo y Abductivo:** - **Deductivo:** Empieza con premisas generales y llega a conclusiones específicas que son lógicamente inevitables si las premisas son verdaderas. - **Inductivo:** Parte de observaciones específicas para llegar a conclusiones generales, ampliando la probabilidad sin garantizar la certeza absoluta. - **Abductivo:** Propone la mejor explicación o hipótesis con base en la evidencia incompleta o limitada, siendo una forma de razonamiento inferencial. 8. **Pensamiento Sistemático:** - Aborda problemas y sistemas en su totalidad, considerando las interacciones entre las partes y cómo un cambio en una parte puede afectar al sistema completo. Estos son solo algunos de los tipos de pensamiento que los psicólogos, educadores y filósofos han identificado. Cada tipo puede ser útil en diferentes contextos y situaciones. Además, los individuos pueden utilizar varios tipos de pensamiento al enfrentarse a desafíos o al procesar información y tomar decisiones."},{"prompt":"grays anatomy - derek deja fuera de la cirugia a george - cual e elp ensamiento holistico","completion":"El pensamiento holístico, en el contexto de la serie \\"Grey's Anatomy\\" y la acción de Derek Shepherd de dejar fuera de una cirugía a George O'Malley, no se refiere directamente a los personajes o sus acciones. En cambio, el pensamiento holístico puede aplicarse a cómo se analiza y entiende esa situación desde una perspectiva más amplia y considerando todas las variables implicadas. Si aplicamos el pensamiento holístico a esta situación, no nos limitaremos a ver el acto de Derek como algo aislado o simplemente una decisión personal contra George. En lugar de eso, evaluaríamos múltiples factores que podrían haber influido en la decisión, como: - El contexto del hospital: la cultura laboral, las políticas y procedimientos, las dinámicas de poder y liderazgo. - Las habilidades y el rendimiento previo de George, y cómo estos son percibidos por Derek y otros miembros del equipo. - Las expectativas de aprendizaje y entrenamiento para los residentes e internos. - Las necesidades del paciente y la complejidad de la cirugía. - La dinámica interpersonal entre Derek, George y otros personajes, así como eventos pasados que podrían haber afectado la relación entre ellos. - El impacto potencial de la decisión en el desarrollo profesional de George y en el equipo quirúrgico. Al considerar todos estos factores y cómo se interrelacionan, podríamos obtener una comprensión más rica y matizada de por qué Derek podría haber tomado la decisión de excluir a George de la cirugía.

Sucede cuando hay una solución que es única e irrepetible.","completion":"El pensamiento lateral o divergente se asocia con generar múltiples soluciones y enfoques creativos para un problema, no con encontrar una solución única e irrepetible. Por lo tanto, la primera afirmación es más precisa: Sucede cuando hay múltiples formas para alcanzar un resultado mediante la creatividad. El pensamiento divergente es un proceso mental utilizado para generar ideas creativas explorando muchas posibles soluciones. A menudo implica romper con el pensamiento convencional y las estructuras establecidas y puede implicar métodos como lluvia de ideas, asociaciones libres y analogías para llegar a soluciones novedosas. El término \\"pensamiento lateral\\" fue acuñado por Edward de Bono y se refiere a una manera de pensar que busca soluciones a través de enfoques no ortodoxos o indirectos y con un pensamiento creativo. Es decir, se trata de encontrar caminos poco convencionales y cuantas más posibilidades, mejor. La idea es salir de los patrones habituales de pensamiento para descubrir ideas frescas e innovadoras. En resumen, el pensamiento lateral o divergente se caracteriza por la creatividad y la generación de múltiples opciones o soluciones, y no está limitado a una única respuesta correcta o inalterable."},{"prompt":"cual de los 2 que te di es la respuesta","completion":"La respuesta correcta a su pregunta es: Sucede cuando hay múltiples formas para alcanzar un resultado mediante la creatividad.

No, el pensamiento lineal también utiliza de la creatividad. - cual de los 2","completion":"La noción de que el pensamiento convergente es aburrido y que solo utiliza procesos monótonos es una generalización que no hace justicia a la complejidad y utilidad del pensamiento convergente. Aunque el pensamiento convergente típicamente se relaciona con procesos lógicos y analíticos para llegar a una solución específica, no significa necesariamente que sea una actividad monótona o carente de creatividad. Respecto a la segunda afirmación, el pensamiento convergente no está limitado al uso de solo uno de los hemisferios cerebrales. Aunque tradicionalmente se ha asociado el hemisferio izquierdo del cerebro con funciones lógicas y analíticas, la neurociencia moderna ha demostrado que ambos lados del cerebro pueden estar involucrados en procesos de razonamiento lógico. La mejor afirmación sería: No, el pensamiento convergente también puede hacer uso de la creatividad. Si bien el pensamiento lineal (otro término que se podría asimilar al pensamiento convergente) implica seguir un enfoque lógico y secuencial, esto no excluye la posibilidad de aplicar creatividad. Inclusive, la capacidad de encontrar la solución más eficaz o de aplicar principios conocidos de formas nuevas puede ser una expresión de creatividad. Por lo tanto, aunque se destaca por seguir un camino lógico hacia una respuesta única, el pensamiento convergente también puede ser un proceso creativo y enriquecedor."},{"prompt":"La diferencia notable entre el pensamiento holístico y analítico es.

End prompt. Will continue in next prompt","completion":"In the savage world of the female gladiatorial arena, few rivalries have burned as fiercely and as passionately as that of Melissa and Mishaali's. The crowds have roared, the arenas have echoed with the clash of their titanic strength for decades. Their battles have become the stuff of legend, the tales of their ferocity and skill passed down through the whispers of their awestruck fans. Melissa, the majestic Spaniard, her long silken hair as fiery as her spirit, stands a daunting 6 feet tall. With piercing blue eyes like the clearest winter's sky, she surveys the world with a warrior's keen gaze. Her muscular frame, sculpted by years of relentless training and battles hard-fought, is a testament to her indomitable will and prowess. Mishaali, the Indian tempest, her brunette tresses cascading down her back like a dark waterfall, an inch shorter than her rival yet no less formidable. Her eyes, brown and deep, have the calm of a still lake with the ominous promise of a storm. Her body, a harmonious blend of muscle and grace, has been honed to perfection through countless matches and challenges. Their rivalry is a silent symphony of respect and hatred, a complex melody that only warriors of their caliber could truly understand. They have never uttered words of admiration for one another; their pride as fierce as their grappling hold. Yet, it cannot be denied that a grudging respect has taken root deep within their hearts, florid after years of relentless competition. However, the competitive fire that blazes within their souls breeds a hate that can only be quenched in the crucible of combat. Throughout their storied rivalry, they have clashed in every conceivable scenario, their names synonymous with the spirit of the fight. Still, somewhere inside, a final confrontation beckons – a death battle to end all battles – but that time has not yet come. For now, it is the thrill of the fight that calls to them, the desire to prove superiority over their equal, the drive to be the undisputed champion of their age-old feud. And so, away from prying eyes and away from the roar of the public coliseums, they have sought a different kind of stage for their confrontation. They agree to meet in private, where the only witnesses will be the silent walls that surround them—a forsaken industrial wasteland on the outskirts of civilization, where broken machinery and rusted girders set the scene of their clandestine encounter. A vast hangar, its gantry cranes like skeletal hands frozen in time, stands as the sentinel to their battlefield. The concrete floor, stained with the oil and sweat of a bygone era, will soon bear witness to their unbridled fury. The air is thick with the memories of toil and labor, a fitting aura for a match that will require every ounce of effort and endurance. There will be no cheers, no chants, no glory but the glory they find in each other's defeat. As dusk approaches, with the fading light casting long shadows across the abandoned factory, Melissa and Mishaali prepare for a fight that will add yet another storied chapter to their epic saga. And the night, silent and expectant, awaits the symphony of violence that will once again rise from these two indomitable spirits as they seek, above all else, to claim the ultimate victory over their eternal rival."},{"prompt":"Create a new location and stage, the stage should be inside a wrestling made of wood and 4 strong manila ropes.","completion":"In the twilight of their long-standing feud, Melissa and Mishaali sought an arena befitting the gravity of their private war—a place isolated from the world, where their battle could unfold untouched by the outside world. Their chosen ground: a weathered, clandestine wrestling ring, hidden within an ancient warehouse on the desolate fringes of the urban sprawl. Tucked away amidst the tangled backstreets and the forgotten remnants of the city's industrial heart, the secretive warehouse carries the whispers of a thousand past encounters, each echo a ghost of struggle and triumph. Its vast, cavernous space is filled with the creaks and groans of aged timber, a symphony that resonates with the impending collision of two unstoppable forces. In the center of this derelict domain stands the wrestling ring—a handcrafted monument to the purity of physical contest. Its squared circle is crafted from seasoned wood, every plank laid down by hands that respect the sanctity of the fight. The posts, thick and resilient, rise up from the wooden base, unyielding in their purpose. Secured to these bastions, four ropes of stout manila stretch tight, their coarse strands whispering the promise of unforgiving restraint against the rush of battle-hardened flesh. This ring, though devoid of grandeur, is rich with an atmosphere of raw competition; its simplicity harkens back to an era where the fight was all that mattered. The air hangs heavy with anticipation, charged with the electricity of impending combat as the two warriors arrive to stake their claim within its bounds. Melissa steps into the arena, her formidable stature casting a long shadow over the wood panels that will serve as the stage for their dance of dominance. As she stretches, the blue of her eyes, sharp as steel, glint with the readiness to engage her timeless adversary. Mishaali, her gaze locked onto Melissa, moves with a predator's grace as she ascends onto the wooden platform. Her tall, muscular frame is poised for the confrontation, each limb a weapon suffused with the power to strike and subdue. In this handmade ring, encircled by their hallowed competition space, the air is thick with the scent of pine and the musk of combatants ready to renew their brutal ballet. As the night sets in, a lone bulb suspended high above flickers to life, casting a focused spotlight on the ring. There, beneath the stark illumination, Melissa and Mishaali will wage their silent war, their grunts and the slap of skin against rope the only testament to the unfurling drama within this clandestine crucible. Far from the eyes of the world they leave behind, in this hidden place where only strength and will can reign, the next chapter of their storied rivalry will be scribed in sweat and resolve. Here, in the Spartan simplicity of their wooden ring, these two titans will clash once more, each seeking to ensnare the other in the unyielding grip of victory."},{"prompt":"choose a random rose, one word only","completion":"Damask"},{"prompt":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 charactersDamask","completion":"\\"Versatile Damask Art Design for Mugs, Tees & Canvas - Classic Pattern for Elegant Home Decor & Fashionable Apparel\\""},{"prompt":"ayudame con el siguiente script de mi juego Unity: // File: Assets/Scripts/PlayerController.cs using UnityEngine; using UnityEngine.AI; public class PlayerController : MonoBehaviour { public float maxDistance = 10f; public float playerSpeed = 5f; public float stoppingDistance = 0.1f; // Distancia considerada como \\"llegado al destino\\" public float distanciaDeAtaque = 1f; public int attackDamage = 1; public GameObject targetAttack; private NavMeshAgent navMeshAgent; private Camera mainCamera; private Animator animator; void Start() { navMeshAgent = GetComponent<NavMeshAgent>(); mainCamera = Camera.main; animator = GetComponent<Animator>(); } void Update() { HandleMovement(); } void HandleMovement() { if (Input.GetMouseButtonDown(0)) { Ray ray = mainCamera.ScreenPointToRay(Input.mousePosition); RaycastHit hit; // Si el rayo choca con 'Terrain', mover al personaje a la posición del rayo if (Physics.Raycast(ray, out hit)) { if (hit.collider.CompareTag(\\"Terrain\\")) { MoveToPosition(hit.point); } else if (hit.collider.CompareTag(\\"Enemy\\")) { MoveAndAttackEnemy(hit.collider.gameObject); } } } // Verificar si el personaje está detenido if (navMeshAgent.remainingDistance <= stoppingDistance) { // Establecer la animación \\"idle\\" si está cerca del destino animator.Play(\\"Idle\\"); } else { // Establecer la animación \\"walk\\" si está en movimiento animator.Play(\\"Walk\\"); } } void MoveToPosition(Vector3 targetPosition) { float distanceToTarget = Vector3.Distance(transform.position, targetPosition); float targetDistance = Mathf.Min(distanceToTarget, maxDistance); navMeshAgent.SetDestination(targetPosition); navMeshAgent.speed = playerSpeed; } void MoveAndAttackEnemy(GameObject enemyObject) { // Mover al jugador hacia el enemigo MoveToPosition(enemyObject.transform.position); // Set targetAttack al objeto enemigo targetAttack = enemyObject; // Verificar si el jugador está lo suficientemente cerca del enemigo para atacar if (Vector3.Distance(transform.position, enemyObject.transform.position) <= distanciaDeAtaque) { // llamamos a la funcion AttackEnemy AttackEnemy(enemyObject); } } void AttackEnemy(GameObject enemyObject) { // Atacamos al enemigo reproducimos la animación de ataque animator.Play(\\"Attack\\"); // Obtenemos el componente Poring (script) del enemigo Poring poring = enemyObject.GetComponent<Poring>(); if (poring != null) { // Llamamos a la funcion TakeDamage del enemigo poring.TakeDamage(attackDamage); } } }","completion":"Este script de Unity, llamado \`PlayerController.cs\`, describe un controlador para un personaje jugador que puede moverse por el mundo usando la navegación por malla (NavMesh) y que puede atacar enemigos. Sin embargo, parece que hay oportunidades para mejorar el diseño y la funcionalidad. A continuación, describo algunas correcciones y mejoras potenciales: 1. **Animación y transiciones**: Al cambiar las animaciones con \`animator.Play(\\"AnimationName\\")\` estás saltando directamente a la animación sin considerar las transiciones, lo cual puede resultar en cambios bruscos. Podrías utilizar parámetros del \`Animator\` para activar transiciones entre estados y hacer que la animación sea más fluida. 2. **Ataque y distancia**: Actualmente estás llamando a \`AttackEnemy()\` dentro del método \`MoveAndAttackEnemy()\` sin tomar en cuenta si estás lo suficientemente cerca para realmente llevar a cabo el ataque. Esto debería hacerse cuando el navMeshAgent haya llegado a su destino y estés a la distancia adecuada. 3. **Chequeos continuos de distancia**: El chequeo de la distancia de ataque debería hacerse de manera continua mientras el jugador se mueve hacia un enemigo, no solo una vez cuando inicialmente se selecciona un enemigo para atacar. 4. **Mejorar ataque**: El sistema de ataque debe incorporar algún tipo de cooldown o tiempo entre ataques para que no se realice el ataque de manera instantánea y repetitiva.

Para resolver este problema, sigue estos pasos: 1. Abre Unity y selecciona el objeto de tu personaje en la jerarquía que tiene el componente \`Animator\`. 2. Asegúrate de tener el Animator Controller asignado al componente \`Animator\` de tu personaje. 3. Ve al Animator Controller dentro de la ventana del Animator.

El \`NavMeshAgent\` intentará acercarse lo más posible al punto central del enemigo, lo que puede no ser posible si \\"choca\\" con su collider. Para solucionar este problema, puedes hacer la revisión de la distancia de ataque en el método \`Update\`, y si el jugador está dentro del rango de ataque, detener el movimiento del \`NavMeshAgent\` y ejecutar el ataque. Aquí te dejo una versión modificada de tu \`Update()\` y \`MoveAndAttackEnemy()\` que hace uso de \`isStopped\` para detener al agente: \`\`\`csharp void Update() { HandleMovement(); if (isAttacking && attackTarget != null) { float distance = Vector3.Distance(transform.position, attackTarget.transform.position); if (distance <= attackDistance) { if (Time.time > lastAttackTime + attackCooldown) { // Detener el movimiento del personaje para atacar al enemigo navMeshAgent.isStopped = true; AttackEnemy(attackTarget); lastAttackTime = Time.time; } } else { // Continuar el movimiento si no estamos lo suficientemente cerca para atacar navMeshAgent.isStopped = false; } } } \`\`\` Sin embargo, desde \`MoveAndAttackEnemy()\`, ya no necesitas llamar directamente a \`AttackEnemy()\`.

In pursuance of the commands that were outlined in the previous paragraph, please write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a concise background (in which the events of the preceding scene leading to the events in the current scene are briefly described, explaining the source of the returning woman's surmounting urge to relieve herself and the reason why she hasn't relieved herself properly by the time she reaches the house; the source of the returning woman's urge shouldn't be induced by illness, laxatives, lactose intolerance, water consumption nor spicy food), for a very long comedic scene in a Comedy Drama TV Seriea that includes the following sequence of events: * A young third-generation Greek-American woman (give her a name, and describe her physical appearance and clothing; she has an aversion from pooping in bathrooms outside the privacy of her home and is secretive about her bowel movements; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt, leggings nor jeans in the scene) is returning home and approaching the door of her family’s apartment with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. The returning woman blurts out an ominous warning. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She emits a soft groan abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping in her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a posture that is more convenient for relieving herself. * Once she assumes the posture, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions and questions why the returning woman assumed such a posture. The present woman's questioning is met in response with the returning woman continuing to deliberately push and relieve herself, while muttering about how good it feels. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is yet again met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels, together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are tinged with relief-induced satisfaction. The returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants at this point, and while she is pushing everything out, she is still savoring the relief while confusingly muttering to herself about things feeling warm and heavy, and then, after a brief pause to softly grunt, she continues to murmur about how much it stinks. The perplexed present woman stares in confusion mixed with concern and asks what stinks, while the returning woman continues to softly grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and subtle euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air with a perplexed expression. As the present woman is sniffing the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor, and then inquires about the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. The present woman inquires about the odor again, describing what it smells like. Then, in a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, what had actually just happened dawns upon her. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman sniffs nearer to the returning woman and emphatically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. Then, in a more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks if the source of the odor is the returning woman having pooped in her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had just happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman stops in her tracks and initially reacts with a sheepish demeanor. * The present woman proceeds to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped in her pants. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification. Then, the present woman exasperatedly chides the returning woman by saying that the returning woman doing something so dirty like pooping in her pants is unbelievably disgusting. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman because the returning woman stayed put at the entrance and childishly finished pooping in her pants once she began. The present woman insists that there is no reason for the returning woman to act like an infant and finish pooping in her pants the way the returning woman did, even if the returning woman's urge to relieve herself got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to poop and that she had to get everything out, as the urge was too strong. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the reasons that forced the returning woman in the first place into such a situation where the returning woman had to make the decision to finish pooping in her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally poop, even if it ended up happening inside her pants. In response to the returning woman's comments, the present woman expresses her disgust and tauntingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty, because it seems to the present woman that the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping in her pants when the returning woman speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman verbally demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's relieving deed. Following halfhearted resistance and hesitation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect the returning woman's rear end. The present woman proceeds to incredulously ridicule the returning woman over the sight of the returning woman's bulging and sagging pants. The present woman continues to taunt the returning woman over how full the returning woman's pants are by describing the sight of the bulging and sagging pants, and expressing disgust at the amount of content that is in the pants. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are so full not because of special intention on the returning woman's part, but rather because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. Then, the returning woman reiterates that despite the dirty outcome, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing pressure in her stomach, and releasing her bowels provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten relief in its entirety once she decided to do it. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is incredibly nasty and reminds the returning woman that the returning woman shouldn't have gotten herself in the first place into a situation where she ends up relieving herself in her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure. Then, the present woman tauntingly remarks that because it looked like the returning woman was feeling good as she was relieving herself, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman childishly enjoys not only relieving herself in her pants, but also having her pants be full of poop. The present woman adds that the returning woman probably enjoys the terrible odor that is emanating from her pants too. * As she is inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants and chiding her, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman’s pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking physical gesture. As she is physically reacting to the odor, the present woman audibly complains about the returning woman being terribly smelly and chides the returning woman for it. * In response, the returning woman concedes that she is terribly smelly in her current state. Then, she adds in coy resignation that given the size of the deposit in her pants, it makes sense that the odor that emanates from her pants stinks this much. * The present woman replies by taunting the returning woman over how pungent the odor that emanates from the returning woman's pants is. Then, the present woman informs the returning woman that the returning woman won’t be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because an odor that pungent is unbearable. After that, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while verbally imploring the returning woman not to drop any of her pants’ contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom. While escorting the returning woman, the present woman is continues to react to the odor and disgustedly assists the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along the two women's way to the bathroom and as she is assisting the returning woman to contain the deposit in the returning woman's pants, the present woman constantly complains about the odor that is emanating from the returning woman's smelly pants. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing while reacting to her own odor. In addition, the returning woman voices her concern that the deposit is spreading inside her pants because of the motion of walking towards the bathroom. In response, the present woman reinforces her grip that is intended to assist the returning woman with the containment of the deposit in the returning woman’s pants. As she is reinforcing her grip, the present woman continues to complain about the the returning woman’s odor. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom’s threshold instead of entering, coyly mentioning that it feels very messy and icky inside her pants, and asking the present woman if she would like to change the her “poopy diaper”. As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty/smelly bum/pants into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grip on the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few more seconds to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while complaining to herself out loud about the odor from the returning woman’s soiled pants.","completion":"INT. APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY We see MARIA, a petite and spirited third-generation Greek-American woman in her mid-20s. Her wavy auburn hair pulled into a practical ponytail, she wears a comfortable graphic T-shirt and wide-legged linen pants. She is clearly flustered, speed-walking down the hallway with an awkward gait—a mix of impatience and discreet discomfort. From Maria’s erratic behaviors and grimacing, it’s evident that her urge to use the bathroom is not a result of illness, laxatives, lactose intolerance, spicy foods, or excessive water intake—but rather a prolonged meeting where no restrooms were available. MARIA reaches her apartment door, rummages through her pockets, and realizes her keys are not there. Panic settles in as she knocks frantically on the door. Maria’s desperation escalates, as she dances in place, barely able to hold herself together; a leg crosses over the other in a subtle yet failed attempt at composure. Her face tightens in distress. MARIA (pleading to the heavens) Oh, come on... Suddenly, a voice from within, *DESPINA*, Maria's mother—a robust, tender-hearted woman in her late 50s with a homely charm and graying hair—calls out. The concern in her voice is evident through the heavy wooden door. DESPINA (O.S.) (muffled by the door) Maria? Is that you banging out there? What happened? MARIA (desperate, trying to maintain composure) Ma, yeah, it's me... Hurry up, please! There's an agonizing delay as she hears the locks turning. Maria fidgets, her expression contorting, her breaths growing shallow. Despina finally opens the door, confused to see her daughter so agitated. Despina stands her ground, trying to understand the urgent display. MARIA (tense, avoiding eye contact) Ma, move... gotta get in. Feeling the tension but assuming it's different in nature, Despina mistakes Maria’s urgency for emotional distress and instinctively reaches out to embrace her. DESPINA (concerned) Maria, tell me what's— MARIA (struggling to wiggle free) No, Ma, please, just... let me through! Their bickering turns into a delicate dance; Maria is trying to navigate around Despina, while Despina, fuelled by her concern, stands firm, gripping her daughter tightly. Without anywhere to go and overwhelmed by the internal pressure, Maria utters a grave warning through gritted teeth. MARIA (low, frantic) Ma, seriously, it’s not a good time— Maria’s endurance caves abruptly, escaping her control with a minor groan. She stands still, her face a vivid canvas of shock, mortification, and a hint of relief. DESPINA (eyes widening) Maria, what's—? Realizing her plight, Maria gently peels away Despina's grip and defaults to a more 'convenient' position in accepting her situation—apologetically squatting. DESPINA (utterly confused) Maria, why are you squatting like that? As Despina inquires, Maria continues her unspeakable act. Her desperate grunts meet the air with hints of uncomfortable satisfaction. MARIA (barely audible, muttering) God... it feels... unreal... Confused, Despina eyes her daughter warily. DESPINA Is something wrong, honey? Maria's response is an involuntary, shuddering sigh, as she mutters about the sensations—equal parts grossed out and relieved. MARIA (whispering) So... warm... heavy...ugh, it stinks... Despina's nose wrinkles as she catches the scent. She throws her head back, sniffing the air while wavering between disbelief and dawning realization. DESPINA What is that smell? Maria, what—? Despina sniffs closer, and her expression shifts from confusion to a disgusted epiphany as the source of the stench becomes indisputable. DESPINA (squinting, recoiling) Jesus, Maria, did you—? Maria looks at her mother with a sheepish grimace, attempting to change the subject. MARIA (squeaky, embarrassed) Can we please... just—? Reluctantly stepping aside with a processed grimace, Despina allows her daughter to pass. With timid waddles, Maria cups her soiled pants, passing her bewildered mother. Despina halts her mid-step with a stern caution about not making more mess. DESPINA (holding her nose) Wait, right there. Don't you dare drop anything! Maria stands, rooted to the spot, with a tint of sheepish remorse fading into a playful sulk. MARIA (wincing) This is on you, Ma. If you hadn't blocked me... Despina glares at her, unreceptive to the defensive playfulness. DESPINA (hands on hips) As if that excuses what you’ve done, Maria! You're an adult, not a toddler! MARIA (arms folded, defiant) I was desperate, Ma! And you were in the way! Maria hesitantly probes the bulk in her pants with an audacious sense of contentment. MARIA (bit of a smirk) Though I gotta say... it kind of—ugh, felt good to let go. Despina's face scrunches up at the confession, teasingly averting her gaze. DESPINA (laughing mockingly) Nasty... can’t believe you're proud of it. Let me see! Despina maneuvers Maria around to face scrutiny, reacting with both ridicule and revulsion. DESPINA (astonished) Look at you... like an overfilled diaper! Maria retorts meekly, her hands still securely placed. MARIA (helpless plea) Ma, it was... so much pressure. Had to get it out. DESPINA (mockingly wagging her finger) That doesn't mean you get to enjoy being disgusting! Maria ineffectually attempts to hide her swelling misery but cannot dispute Despina's brow-raising sniff near her soiled rear. DESPINA (taunting rollback) Oh, you’re ripe! Get moving; we need to clean this mess up! Maria obliges with a labored waddle as Despina, still pinching her nostrils, guides and supports her. Complaining about the smell, Despina ensures nothing falls. MARIA (slightly amused but distressed) It's spreading, Ma! DESPINA (firm, careful grip) I know, dear. Just keep moving. Upon arriving at the bathroom, Maria halts cheekily at the threshold. MARIA (teasing, gesturing to her pants) Wanna change my diaper, Ma? An amused Despina counters the jest with a firm push, squishing the backside of Maria's pants, propelling her forward into the bathroom. DESPINA (playful but resolute) Inside. Now. Enough games. Maria reacts with a yelp, conveying the grotesquery of feeling the squashed mess. Despina steps back, satisfied as justice for the insolent joke. After Maria is in, Despina closes the bathroom door behind her, visibly relieved to end the encounter, yet grumbling about the odor as she strides away to manage the aftermath.

APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY MARIA, a spirited twenty-something with an athletic build, her auburn hair tied back, is speed-walking down the hallway. She wears a pair of loose-fitting khaki cargos and a simple blue T-shirt that matches her eyes. An airpod dangles from one ear. Her every motion is stifled, her urgency palpable; she winces, the product of a day-long road trip with friends who fancy roadside attractions more than restroom breaks. She arrives at a door, patting down her pockets in a rhythm of increasing frenzy. The realization hits—no keys. MARIA Oh, no, no... Frantic, she knocks, each thud accentuated by her bobbing in place. Inside, movements, a chain rattles. DESPINA, mid-50s, emerges through the door partially. Her face is warm, a few strands of silver in her otherwise chestnut hair. DESPINA Maria, why are you pounding like the police? MARIA (beads of sweat on her brow) Ma! Open up—hurry! DESPINA Concern crosses her face, her movements slow, deliberate, adding to the suspense. MARIA Anxiety pitches higher, her feet crossing and uncrossing at an erratic tempo. The door finally swings open. Despina's arms are open for an embrace, but Maria bypasses. MARIA (murmuring) Gotta get inside. Move, Ma. DESPINA (slow to catch on) My god, Maria, what’s got into— Maria attempts to slip past her mother, but Despina's motherly instincts override, arms capturing her in a firm hold. DESPINA (out of worry, not anger) What's wrong, tell me, are you— MARIA (wriggling, desperate) Ma, not now, please, I need to— Neither articulates the gravity of the situation, a battle of concern and concealment. MARIA (ominous, tense) Ma, you really don’t wanna do this... Maria reaches a tipping point; a soft moan escapes as her body resigns. DESPINA (eyes searching her daughter's face) Maria? Your face—what's— Maria wrestles free, assumes the ungainly posture of necessity. Despina watches, flabbergasted. Maria's face contorts—agonized relief. MARIA (voice a ragged whisper) Oh god, this is... DESPINA (eyes wide, concern increasing) Maria, why are you squatting? Do you need help? Confusion prevents her from stopping Maria's action, even as a distressed grimace takes over. MARIA (struggling with the reality) It's...good, but... Ah, god, the smell... Despina's nose twitches, detective skills kicking in as the pieces connect. DESPINA (nose in the air, frowning) What is that? What am I smelling? Maria keeps muttering, her red-faced effort compounding with physical manifestation. DESPINA (step back, realization spread on her face) Maria, tell me you didn’t just...? MARIA (eyes lowered, a half-nod) Can we—talk inside, maybe? Despina side-steps, the stench hits her, expression a puzzle of disgust. Maria makes clumsy, burdened steps in, Despina's voice rising with an edge. DESPINA (hands gesturing a stop) Wait! Don't move, or God knows... Maria halts, legs locking, a silhouette of chagrin. MARIA (consternation masks the playfulness) It wouldn’t have happened if you'd just... The dispute reaches a head; Despina refuses to accept the makeshift excuse. DESPINA (index finger raised) Excuses are for children, Maria! And what is this—squatting here? MARIA (folding arms, stubborn) I couldn't help it, Ma. It was too much! Maria assesses the gravity of her pants delicately. MARIA (lip curling) Honestly, messy as it is, feels...like a weight's lifted. DESPINA (laughs, sarcasm dripping) My heart swells with pride. Show me the damage... Maria rotates, reluctantly to her mother’s curious and horrified gaze. DESPINA (mock horror) Oh, sweet mercy, that’s... it’s like you’ve got a cargo hold! MARIA (defensively) I didn't want this! But relief is relief, and—agh! DESPINA (teasing despite the crisis) And here I thought you just liked your cargos roomy! Maria’s grimace falters as Despina continues to prod the situation. DESPINA (sniffing deliberately) It stinks to high heaven! Let's clean this... Maria moves along, Despina guiding her with an unsavory diligence. MARIA (voice muffled) It's shifting, Ma... feels worse. DESPINA (fighting off the smell) Just a bit farther, we'll get you sorted... Reaching the bathroom, Maria pauses, mischief in her eyes. MARIA (smiling despite herself) You always wanted to change my diapers again, huh? DESPINA (playing along) Get your dirty behind in there! Maria reacts as Despina squash-pushes her in, the mess spreading in revolt. DESPINA (nose pinched) Now you're in, let's get this over with!

Ps4","completion":"The performance of Fortnite or any video game on your PS4 depends on several factors, including your hardware, game settings, and internet connection. If you're experiencing framerate drops (where your FPS fluctuates between 60 and 35), it's often not directly related to your internet connection. Framerate is primarily influenced by the console's hardware and the settings you've chosen within the game. Here's how they both affect your experience: 1. Hardware: Since you're on a PS4, the hardware should be adequate to run Fortnite smoothly at consistent frame rates, as the game is well-optimized for consoles. However, if your PS4 is older or has dust build-up, it may be overheating or operating less efficiently. 2. Game Settings: The game settings can affect performance as well. You should check your video settings to ensure that they're optimized for performance. Reducing graphical settings like shadows, textures, and effects may help maintain a more consistent framerate. As for your internet connection, it typically affects things like latency (ping) and packet loss, rather than framerate. Latency is the time it takes for data to travel from your system to the game server and back. A stable and low ping (measured in milliseconds, ms) is crucial for a smooth online gaming experience. In Fortnite, a ping of less than 50 ms is considered excellent, 50-100 ms is good, and anything above 100 ms may start to introduce noticeable lag, with delays in your actions or other players' actions being evident. If your ping is 120 ms or higher, you may certainly experience lag in terms of how responsive the game feels, but it shouldn't directly cause your FPS to drop. Here are a few tips to improve your ping and overall internet connection for gaming: - Use a wired Ethernet connection instead of Wi-Fi, if possible, as it can provide a more stable and faster connection. - Close other applications on your PS4 and other devices that may be consuming bandwidth. - Ensure no large downloads or streams are running in your network while playing. - Contact your internet service provider if you consistently experience high latency, as there may be issues with your connection or router. - Set your PS4 as the DMZ host in your router settings, or forward ports used by PS4 and Fortnite to improve connection stability. If you continue to have performance issues, you might want to look into other potential causes such as the PS4 system needing maintenance or hardware issues."},{"prompt":"I've seen other ppl's Fortnite run better than, they get like 60-50 fps and I'm having constant 60-35 drop can it be a problem with my internet and if so how much ping can cause lag, like 200+? Ps4 27 January 2024","completion":"If you're noticing that other people are experiencing better performance in Fortnite on their consoles, and you're facing constant frame rate drops, it's typically more related to console performance issues rather than your internet connection. Internet connection primarily affects your latency (ping), not your frames per second (FPS). FPS is influenced by your console's processing power, any background processes, and the game's graphical settings. Here are some things you can check or do to possibly improve your performance: 1. Overheating: Ensure your PS4 is well-ventilated and not overheating, as this can cause performance issues. 2. Background applications: Close any unnecessary background applications that might be running. 3. Game settings: Review and adjust the game settings to prioritize performance over quality—lowering graphical settings can lead to a boost in FPS. 4. PS4 condition: Ensure your PS4 is clean and free of dust, particularly around the vents and internal cooling systems. 5. Software updates: Make sure both your PS4 system software and your game are up to date with the latest patches and updates. 6. Restore default settings: You might try restoring your game settings to default in case any configuration is causing issues. 7. Rebuild database: Consider rebuilding your PS4 database, which might improve performance without deleting your games or saved data. Regarding your internet connection, while high latency doesn't typically lower your FPS, it can make games feel laggy and unresponsive. In Fortnite, a ping over 200 ms is quite high and can result in a noticeable delay between your actions and what happens in the game. At this level of latency, player movements can appear jerky, and you may experience rubber-banding or hits not registering timely. To potentially improve your ping, follow these suggestions: - Ensure a stable internet connection by using a wired connection instead of Wi-Fi when possible. - Avoid network-intensive activities on the same connection, like streaming, downloading, or other online gaming. - Restart your modem and router to refresh your connection. - Look into network congestion – if multiple devices are using the network, try playing when there's less demand. - Contact your Internet Service Provider if you consistently have high ping times as there may be an issue with your service or equipment. Remember, comparing the performance with others is not always apples-to-apples unless they are also using a PS4 in similar conditions. Differences in hardware models (such as a standard PS4 vs. PS4 Pro), system maintenance, and network conditions can all impact performance. If you continue to have problems, it might be time to consult with Sony's customer support or a professional to inspect your console for potential hardware issues."},{"prompt":"Is this issue common or can it be that the other people's recorded gameplay shares an automatically upscaled footage?","completion":"If you're comparing your Fortnite gameplay experience on a PS4 to that of footage you've seen from others, there are several factors that could explain the difference in performance: 1. Gameplay footage from a stronger hardware platform: It's possible that the gameplay you're comparing with is from a stronger platform, such as a PS4 Pro, a high-end gaming PC, or even the newer PS5 console, all of which would naturally have higher performance capabilities. 2. Post-production enhancements: Sometimes, content creators enhance their gameplay footage during the editing process, making it look smoother than it might have been during actual gameplay. This can be misconstrued as better actual gameplay performance when, in reality, it's an editing trick. 3. Variable performance across consoles: Not every PS4 operates at the same level due to differences in hardware wear and tear, the presence of dust inside the console, thermal paste condition, and other factors. Just because your PS4 seems to be underperforming compared to another person's PS4 doesn't necessarily indicate a common widespread issue. 4. Framerate vs. Ping: Remember, framerate (FPS) and ping (latency) are two different things. Higher ping affects the timeliness and smoothness of online interactions but shouldn't impact your FPS. As for automatic upscaling of footage, this isn't likely to be the source of the discrepancy. Most recorders and streaming platforms capture the gameplay at the native resolution and framerate that the game outputs. If a content creator wants to upscale footage, it's a manual process that involves video editing software and usually has more to do with resolution than framerate. Upscaling typically refers to increasing the resolution, not artificially enhancing the framerate. If you're viewing videos uploaded online, there's also the possibility of high frame rate video playback (such as 60fps) if the creator recorded the footage on a device capable of running the game at that framerate and then encoded the video for high frame rate playback on platforms that support it, like YouTube. In summary, while it's not common for PS4 gameplay to be automatically upscaled, discrepancies can occur due to a variety of factors: the relative performance of the consoles, differences in recording and post-production techniques, and the performance capabilities of different game platforms. To troubleshoot your performance issues, it's best to focus on your specific setup and console condition."},{"prompt":"Can I share that video with you so u can examine if his using any settings","completion":"As an AI developed by OpenAI, I'm currently unable to directly access or view external content such as videos. However, I can provide you with general advice on what to look for that might indicate that a content creator has applied specific settings or post-processing enhancements to their gameplay footage: 1. **Check for smoothness**: If the video playback is extremely smooth (i.e., consistent frame-rates without any drops), especially during intense action scenes where typical gameplay might experience some performance hits, this might indicate post-production smoothing or the use of a higher-end console or PC. 2. **Look for visual fidelity**: High resolution, detailed shadows, and elaborate particle effects can suggest the use of higher graphical settings or hardware that can support such settings without impacting performance. 3. **Listen for commentary**: Sometimes creators talk about their settings while playing or in the video's description. They may also provide guides or tips on how to achieve the best performance, which could offer insight into their setup. 4. **Pay attention to overlays**: Overlays with real-time FPS counters might be present, indicating that what you are seeing is likely the actual performance the creator is experiencing. 5. **Resolution and FPS**: Check the video description or the settings icon on the playback interface, as platforms like YouTube will show you the max resolution and frame rate available for a video. This could provide clues about the performance level during recording. 6. **Gameplay quality**: If the motion in the gameplay seems too flawless or 'cinematic', it might have been enhanced or edited in post-production. 7. **Consult the community**: If the video is on a platform that allows comments, sometimes other viewers will have asked about the settings or hardware being used, and you might find answers there. Remember that no matter what settings a content creator might be using, those settings are specific to their hardware setup and may not translate directly to improved performance on your PS4. Additionally, online videos are often compressed, which can hide certain performance issues present during actual gameplay. If you're experiencing lower performance on your console, adjusting your own in-game settings to prioritize performance, ensuring your console is well-ventilated, and making sure it's free from hardware problems like dust accumulation or overheating are more effective steps you can take to try to improve your gameplay experience."},{"prompt":"Write a story where a girl falls headfirst into a gooey pit of bubblegum, when she comes out she can't get it off, She slams her fist in frustration leading to her hand becoming a splat shape, With just a mere thought it reforms, She realizes she has became a shape-shifting blob of bubblegum (currently retaining human shape, but she can change at will), and uses this to her advantage","completion":"Once in the small town of Bubblegurt, there was a festival known far and wide for its peculiar, yet delightful attraction – the Bubblegum Bog. This was no ordinary bog, however. It was a pit filled with a mixed assortment of the chewiest, gooiest, and most elastic bubblegum ever concocted, an experimental delight created by the town's eccentric candy maker, Fiona Floss. During the festival, young thrill-seekers would often dive into the bubblegum for fun, always emerging with vibrant smiles and colorful gobs of gum stuck to their hair and clothes. It was a sticky badge of honor, and this year, a girl named Giselle decided she wanted to take the challenge. Giselle was a curious and adventurous soul, with a sweet tooth that matched her spirited nature. As she approached the edge of the vividly pink bog, she hesitated, the intoxicating scent of sugary fruit wafting to her nose. Gathering her courage, she leaped with an enthusiastic cheer, expecting to plunge into the gum and bounce right back. However, instead of popping up as everyone else did, Giselle sank. The bubblegum, thick and syrupy, closed over her head as she fell, enveloping her in a warm, sticky cocoon. Panicked, she flailed until she finally managed to surface with a great pop, her entire body glistening with goo. Struggling out of the bog, Giselle attempted to peel the bubblegum off her skin and hair, but it wouldn't budge. It clung to her like a second skin, leaving her frustrated and scared. She slammed her goo-covered fist onto a nearby wooden table, and to her shock, her hand flattened upon impact, stretching out like a rubbery pancake. Staring in disbelief, she willed her hand to return to normal – and just like that, it did, as if the bubblegum were obeying her thoughts. The townsfolk around her gasped, and murmurs of astonishment swept through the crowd. It was then that Giselle realized she was no longer just a girl. She had become a shape-shifting blob of bubblegum. With this realization came a rush of excitement – Giselle had always dreamt of possessing a superpower, and now it seemed she had one. The first few days, she experimented with her newfound ability in secrecy. She stretched her limbs to incredible lengths, morphed her fingers into tools, and even flattened herself into a thin sheet to slide under doors. Each new discovery brought her boundless joy and gave her a sense of freedom she had never known. Giselle quickly learned to control her powers, and she decided to use her gumminess for the greater good. She became a local hero of sorts. Lost kittens stuck in trees had only to meow for Giselle to extend her arms and rescue them safely. When a child's ball rolled into a narrow pipe, Giselle transformed her hand into a scoop to retrieve it. Her most noteworthy feat came when a sneaky robber tried to escape the police by darting into the intricate network of alleys around Bubblegurt Square. With ease, Giselle slinked through the tight spaces, outpacing the criminal with her malleable form. She apprehended him by stretching across the alley and bouncing the surprised thief back into the arms of the law. As word of her deeds spread, Giselle's legend grew. She embraced the nickname \\"GumGirl,\\" sporting a costume with a logo that mimicked the familiar swirl of a freshly blown bubble. The people of Bubblegurt celebrated their new hero with pride, and Fiona Floss, the creator of the Bubblegum Bog, watched with satisfaction. Her creation had not only brought joy to the town but given rise to something truly extraordinary. And as for Giselle, she couldn't have been happier, living out her sweetest, gummiest dreams."},{"prompt":"Write an alternate history scenario + lore for the anime and manga series Elfen Lied in the

whispered tales by the light of the hearths, the origins of the diclonii traced back to the time before the shogunate shadow crept over Nihon. It was an age of gods and spirits, where myth walked alongside mortals, and the veils between worlds were gossamer-thin. The provinces of Omoiyari, Kutara, and Shinra, burgeoning civilizations on the peninsular realms of Chosŏn, teemed with burgeoning life and unspoken mysteries. The diclonii, a species of exquisite and fearsome humanoids, were whispered to have emerged from the heart of these ancient lands. Tales passed down from sage to child spun the birth of these creatures not as a happenstance of nature, but as a deliberate act of divine will or celestial event shrouded in enigma. Born only as females with a profound link to the ethereal, they were marked by distinct cat-ear like bone horns adorning their heads, and each possessed vectors—telekinetic limbs of spiritual essence that could resonate at deadly sonic frequencies. These vectors, phantasmal and formidable, were known for cutting through the corporeal with ease, and through their very existence, the diclonii reshaped the cultural contours of the lands they touched. The capacity for destruction laced within each diclonius was only matched by the profound depth of their sorrow, for they were bound to a cycle of propagation that intertwined their fate with humanity's own. These enigmatic beings reproduced not through conventional means, but by a subtle and sinister infection wrought upon humans. Their vectors, normally unseen and unfelt, would weave an imperceptible tapestry of change into the seed of human offspring, ensuring that any female child born henceforth would emerge as one of their own kind. This silent invasion ignited a fear that would smolder within the hearts of mankind for centuries to come. The presence of the diclonii resonated through the spiritual tapestry of the land, seeping into the lore and mythos of the people. They became the foundation of the ominous Oni of the future legends, monsters of unfathomable power said to reside in secluded caves and craggy mountains. The uncanny likeness between the feared Oni and the tragic diclonii was no mere coincidence—it was a melding of truth and fable, a conflation of the misunderstood with the mystical. Murmurs of villages laid to waste by invisible, slicing forces began to flutter across the provinces, carried on the winds that swept the peninsular lands. The knowledge of this emerging threat spread with mixed reactions; some wished to understand and coexist, while many saw them as abominations to be purged. It was in these crucible years that humanity's capacity for both compassion and cruelty would be tested, as fear often lashed out with blind fury. The diclonii, ever caught in the throes of their existence, sought solace and survival in the face of humanity's tightening noose. They found refuge in the dense woods and rugged hillocks, weaving semblances of societies bound by their shared heritage and unspoken grief. Yet, as the wheel of time churned, it brought with it an undying legacy that would haunt the shores of Nihon and its people, embedding within its cultural fabric the tension between the seen and the unseen, the known and the unknown. With each generation that bore the mark of the horns, the legend of the Oni took shape, painting the diclonii as malevolent spirits rather than the complex beings they were. As the Samguk-sidae—the Three Kingdoms of Korea—rose from the vestiges of Omoiyari, Kutara, and Shinra, they bore with them this inherited tapestry of the diclonii, weaving further the enigmatic legacy that would one day blossom into the full, fearsome pantheon of Japanese yokai. And so, the diclonii remained, imprinted upon the soul of a world that would seldom understand them."},{"prompt":"Write an alternate history scenario + lore for the anime and manga series Elfen Lied

Birth of Whispered Legends – Diclonii and the Oni In the age where shadows of history stretch long and the bones of the earth still whispered of untold secrets, a profound change burgeoned across the Japanese home islands and the proximate lands of Hanguk, then segmented into the realms known as Omoiyari, Kutara, and Shinra. These dominions, ordained by history as \\"the Samguk-sidae\\" or \\"Three Kingdoms of Korea,\\" cradled a phenomenon destined to weave itself into the fabric of legend and nightmare. It was within these crucibles of culture and conflict that the diclonii first emerged. Enigmatic and isolated, they were an all-female species of humanoids, distinguishable by bone-like protrusions resembling cat's ears crowning their heads. But beyond such aesthetically unusual traits lay the cornerstone of their enigmatic nature – vectors. These were invisible, telekinetic appendages that extended outwards from their backs, capable of reaching with precision and power. Vectors, in their intangibility, acted as spectral limbs, and each diclonius possessed a unique command over them. This command enabled the vectors to vibrate at sub to supersonic frequencies, granting the diclonii the ability to seamlessly sever and slice through matter, should they opt to exert such violence. This horrifying capability inscribed within them an unimaginable potential for both creation and destruction. The diclonii were anomalous, not merely in form, but also in their propagation. Their kind reproduced by an unassuming yet insidious method, one that threaded their existence with that of humans. By the unseen touch of their vectors, they would infect their human counterparts. This enigmatic contagion assured that any female child born henceforth to the tainted line would enter the world as a diclonius, thus ensuring the silent proliferation of their secluded species. As the spectral whisper of diclonii influence silently pervaded the isles and the kingdoms, it cast a shadow upon the human worlds of Yamato, Omoiyari, Kutara, and Shinra. In their seclusion and with the evolution of their strange powers, the diclonii grew into a formidable presence. Their existence pressed upon the peripheries of human consciousness, shaping an enduring presence in folklore and superstition. The diclonius, with their formidable vectors, forged the cradle of legends that birthed the Oni. These fearsome creatures of lore, monstrous and mountain-dwelling, became the object of tales spun by the fireside. To the common folk, the Oni were demon-kind, residing within the darkness of caves, beyond the light of the hearth. They were the trolls, orcs, and ogres of nightmares, and in their monstrous depictions, the misunderstood shadow of the diclonius was cast. It was said, in hushed tones and with wide eyes, that the Oni bore horns upon their heads and possessed strength beyond mortal ken, traits eerily reflective of the diclonius vector mastery. Yet significantly, the potent fear engendered by the Oni spoke less of its features and more of its unfathomable and untamed might—powers which only the diclonii wielded. And so, the diclonii lived alongside humans, hidden yet integral, weaving the threads of their existence into the tapestry of human fear and awe. In the numerous skirmishes and political intrigues of the Three Kingdoms, whispers of the diclonii's might were often used to explain away inexplicable defeats or the sudden turns of fortune. As centuries folded upon one another, the line between myth and reality blurred. What surface truths were grasped about the diclonii sunk beneath the weight of legend, leaving behind a mythic heritage that shrouded their very existence. Thus were the diclonii enshrined in the annals of time, no longer solely beings of flesh and blood, but specters dwelling in the realm of myths and monsters, elusive as the morning fog upon the rugged cliffs of Yamato and the hills of the Samguk-sidae."},{"prompt":"请把这段Java代码改为并发执行，提高效率： @Override public List<KNodeTrain> kNodeTrainsPostProcess(@NotNull List<KNodeTrain> kNodeTrains, @NotNull ServiceWrapper serviceWrapper) { kNodeTrains = kNodeTrains.stream().filter(kNodeTrain -> !kNodeTrain.isReset()).collect(Collectors.toList());

确定是否可以请求较小的数据集，只获取必要信息。 4. **优化请求**： - 维持一个持久连接（session），这样可以避免每次请求都进行握手。 - 如果您的请求是一系列相互独立的请求，可以考虑使用 ThreadPool 来并行发送请求。 5. **数据解析优化**： - 使用 \`response.json()\` 直接获取 JSON 响应，而不是先获取文本然后再进行解析。 - 如果返回的数据很大，考虑使用流式请求处理或者 chunked 请求处理。 应用这些策略的修改示例： \`\`\`python import requests import json def get_train_data(train_api, train_config_id): payload = json.dumps({\\"trainConfigId\\": train_config_id}) headers = {'Content-Type': 'application/json'} # 举例，具体需要的 header 根据 API 要求来设定 with requests.Session() as session: response = session.post(train_api, headers=headers, data=payload) response.raise_for_status() # 检查请求是否成功 json_res = response.json() # 直接使用.json()获取响应内容 return json_res['knodeTrains'] # 一次获取部分数据的例子，可能需要根据 API 的支持来实现 def get_paginated_train_data(train_api, train_config_id, page_size): result = [] page = 0 while True: payload = json.dumps({ \\"trainConfigId\\": train_config_id, \\"page\\": page, \\"pageSize\\": page_size }) with requests.Session() as session: response = session.post(train_api, headers=headers, data=payload) response.raise_for_status() data = response.json()['knodeTrains'] result.extend(data) if len(data) < page_size: break # 没有更多的页了 page += 1 return result \`\`\` 重新运行代码后，如果问题仍然存在，则需要进一步分析数据获取的整个过程，识别性能瓶颈，并考虑如何解决它们。如果问题更加复杂，与相关服务提供商协作找出解决方案通常更有效。如果有更多具体的信息或性能指标，将有助于更精确地解决这个问题。"},{"prompt":"with requests.Session() as session: response = session.post(train_api, headers=headers, data=payload) 会加快速度嘛","completion":"使用 \`requests.Session()\` 可以在某些情况下提升请求的速度，主要是因为 \`Session\` 对象能够在多个请求之间持久化某些参数，如 cookies，并且在同一个 \`Session\` 实例中重用底层的 TCP 连接（通过 HTTP/1.1 的 keep-alive 功能）。这可能消除了在连续请求中建立和关闭连接的开销，从而减少了总体请求时间。 但是，如果您只发送单个请求或者对不同的主机发送请求，那么使用 \`Session\` 可能不会带来明显的性能改善。此外，如果服务器端响应时间很慢或者处理请求的时间很长，那么客户端复用连接的收益可能就不那么明显了。 故而，使用 \`Session\` 可以帮助提升请求速度，尤其是在下述情况中： 1. **连续对同一主机发送多个请求**：在进行连续的请求时，如下载多个文件、请求分页数据、或交互式通信等，使用 \`Session\` 可以充分利用 keep-alive 连接，避免反复的 TCP 握手。 2. **需要在请求之间保持状态**：如果需要在请求之间保持 cookies 或其他会话信息，使用 \`Session\` 比每次请求再传递这些信息更为高效。 3. **自定义会话配置**：您可以为 \`Session\` 设置额外的配置，如适配器参数、重试策略等，来优化请求的发送。 如果您在应用中只使用了一次 POST 请求，像这样： \`\`\`python with requests.Session() as session: response = session.post(train_api, headers=headers, data=payload) \`\`\` 并且没有在同一 session 中执行其他请求或这是一个特别耗时的单个请求，那么您不太可能见到显著性能的改善。为了优化单个请求的性能，可能需要关注不同的方面，比如服务器处理速度、网络延迟，或者请求和响应数据的大小。 最好的做法是测试两种方式的性能差异来做出决定。您可以通过测量请求的往返时间来检查使用 \`Session\` 相对于普通的 \`requests.post\` 调用是否有明显的性能提升。此外，如果您知道将要连续进行多个请求，则使用 \`requests.Session()\` 绝对是值得的。"},{"prompt":"tensorflow神经网络，如果输入类别按照顺序，比如前10w个是类别1，后10w个是类别2，会不会导致神经网络训练集出现准确率极高的情况","completion":"当您在训练神经网络时，数据输入的顺序确实会产生影响。如果您的训练数据是有序的，即所有的一个类别的数据都在一起，然后是另一个类别的数据，这可能会影响训练过程，导致模型无法正确学习数据的潜在分布。 主要的问题是，如果输入数据是有序的，那么网络在训练过程的每个epoch中只能看到某个类别的特征。这意味着它在学习时可能会过度适应（过拟合）目前正处理的这个类别，而不是学习如何从所有可能的输入中区分类别。这通常表现为训练误差很低而验证/测试误差则较高，因为网络没有学会泛化。 因此，在训练开始之前，一个常见的最佳实践是**打乱**数据，这通常通过随机化的方式对训练数据进行排序（shuffling）。大多数深度学习框架和库，包括 TensorFlow，提供了这种数据打乱的功能。在 TensorFlow 中，您可以使用 \`tf.data.Dataset\` API 和它的 \`shuffle\` 方法来随机调整数据顺序。 举个例子，如何在 TensorFlow 中打乱数据集： \`\`\`python import tensorflow as tf # 假定您已经有了一个包含训练数据和标签的数据集 # train_data 是输入特征，train_labels 是相应的标签 train_data = ... train_labels = ... # 将数据和标签转换为 tf.data.Dataset dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((train_data, train_labels)) # 打乱数据：buffer_size 应大致等于数据集的大小或完全等于它 # 虽然，为了内存使用考虑，对于非常大的数据集，一个更小的大小也可以工作不错 buffer_size = len(train_data) dataset = dataset.shuffle(buffer_size) # 继续其他数据处理，比如批处理和重复 batch_size = 32 dataset = dataset.batch(batch_size).repeat() # 使用 dataset 进行训练... \`\`\` 使用打乱的数据进行训练将有助于防止学习到与数据中的类别顺序相关的模式，从而提高模型泛化的能力。 在实践中，确保您的验证集和测试集与训练数据分布一致，且在训练过程中不进行打乱，以便准确评估模型的性能。此外，把眼光放在验证集和测试集的性能指标上，特别是如果您怀疑训练集的效果异常好的时候。"},{"prompt":"reduce_lr = ReduceLROnPlateau( monitor='val_loss', mode='min', factor=0.5, patience=4, min_lr=1e-5, verbose=1 ) 第一轮，学习率过大导致loss出现nan","completion":"在利用神经网络进行训练时，学习率对模型性能的影响非常大。如果学习率过大，会导致模型参数更新过于激烈，可能会超过损失函数的最小值，从而导致损失函数值变成\`NaN\`（不是一个数）。另一方面，如果学习率设置得太小，模型训练从而变得十分缓慢，甚至可能卡在局部最小值不能前进。 \`ReduceLROnPlateau\` 是 Keras 提供的一个回调函数，当模型的评价指标不再提升时可以自动减少学习率。在您的代码例子中： - \`monitor\`参数设置为\`'val_loss'\`，意味着回调函数会监视验证集上的损失。 - \`mode\`参数设置为\`'min'\`，意味着监视的目标是\`val_loss\`的最小值。 - \`factor\`参数设置为\`0.5\`，意味着每次减小学习率时，学习率将乘以这个因子。 - \`patience\`参数设置为\`4\`，意味着只有当\`val_loss\`在四个epoch内没有改善时，学习率才会减少。 - \`min_lr\`参数设置为\`1e-5\`，表示学习率的下限。 如果在第一轮训练时损失就变成\`NaN\`，这可能是学习率过大导致的。\`ReduceLROnPlateau\`并不能立即解决这个问题，因为它在训练进程中较晚被调用。为了解决这个问题，您应该首先确保初始学习率设置得足够低，来避免这种情况的发生。 此外，导致“NaN loss”出现的其他原因可能包括： - **权重初始化**：过大或过小的初始权重都可能导致模型训练不稳定。 - **数据预处理**：确保输入数据已经被适当的标准化或归一化。 - **数值稳定性**：例如，在执行对数或者除法运算时，输入值可能趋近于0，增加了出现\`NaN\`的风险。 - **数据错误**：在数据集中可能含有\`NaN\`或无穷大等非数值。 如果确实确定学习率过高是问题所在，可以考虑采取如下步骤： 1. 降低初始学习率，例如，从\`1e-3\`或\`1e-4\`开始。 2. 检查网络参数初始化方法，适当选择。 3. 检查数据预处理步骤，确保无误。 4. 逐渐增大学习率，直到找到导致稳定性问题的阈值。 最后，运行新的训练时注意观察验证集损失，并调整\`ReduceLROnPlateau\`的相关参数帮助找到合适的学习率。实现有效的学习率调整策略有时需要不断尝试和调整。"},{"prompt":"def get_model(x_shape=5, y_shape=40): model = Sequential([ tf.keras.layers.InputLayer(input_shape=(x_shape, y_shape)), LSTM(128, return_sequences=True, kernel_regularizer=l2(0.001)), Dropout(0.2), BatchNormalization(), LSTM(64, return_sequences=False), Dropout(0.2), BatchNormalization(), Dense(256, activation='relu', kernel_regularizer=l2(0.001)), Dropout(0.2), Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'), ]) model.summary() model.compile( optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(), loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy', 'Precision', 'Recall'] ) early_stopping = EarlyStopping( monitor='val_loss', mode='min', verbose=1, patience=20, restore_best_weights=True ) reduce_lr = ReduceLROnPlateau( monitor='val_loss', mode='min', factor=0.5, patience=4, min_lr=1e-5, verbose=1 ) return model, [early_stopping, reduce_lr] 怎么改，初始的学习率怎么设置","completion":"在您的函数 \`get_model\` 中定义了一个 LSTM 网络模型，用于处理时间序列或序列数据，并且作为二分类问题。同时，您还定义了两个用于训练时提高模型性能和稳定性的回调函数：EarlyStopping 和 ReduceLROnPlateau。 对于初始学习率的设置，如果您在首次训练时遇到 \`loss\` 变成 \`NaN\`，这很可能是由于学习率太高导致的。在这种情况下，您可以尝试降低初始学习率。通常，有效的学习率通常取决于具体的模型架构和数据集，但很多情况下从更小的学习率如 \`1e-3\` 或 \`1e-4\` 开始是比较安全的。 此外，您还可以使用一个小的学习率来起步，然后通过观察训练期间的损失变化来决定是否需要调整。另一种方式是通过学习率寻找试验（learning rate finder experiment）来实验性地查找最优的学习率。 修改后的 \`get_model\` 函数示例： \`\`\`python def get_model(x_shape=5, y_shape=40, initial_lr=1e-3): # 添加一个初始学习率参数 model = Sequential([ # ... 省略了其他层的定义 ]) model.summary() model.compile( # 使用初始学习率参数 optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=initial_lr), # ... 省略了损失函数和评价指标的其他部分 ) # ... 省略了回调函数的其他部分 return model, [early_stopping, reduce_lr] \`\`\` 在调用 \`get_model\` 时，您可以传递所需的初始学习率： \`\`\`python model, callbacks = get_model(x_shape=5, y_shape=40, initial_lr=1e-3) \`\`\` 通过这样做，您就有了起步时更小的学习率，并且还保持了通过 \`ReduceLROnPlateau\` 在训练过程中根据验证集的损失动态调整学习率的能力。 务必在训练过程中仔细监控模型的损失和准确率，并且根据需要调整学习率。您可能还需要进行多次实验和调整，以找到最适合您数据集和模型架构的学习率。"},{"prompt":"Prisons are an addition to human civilization. How did they come about?","completion":"The concept of imprisonment as a form of punishment has a lengthy history that has evolved significantly over centuries. Here's an overview of how prisons came about and their development into the institutions we recognize today. **Ancient and Medieval Times:** In ancient societies like those of Mesopotamia, Egypt, Greece, and Rome, punishments were often swift, brutal, and public. These could include fines, corporal punishment, enslavement, exile, or death. However, there were also various forms of detention used to hold individuals either awaiting trial or punishment, or for other purposes such as enslavement or political control. In ancient Rome, for example, the Mamertine Prison was one of the earliest known facilities used to detain prominent prisoners of war, political prisoners, and others. During the Middle Ages in Europe, incarceration was not typically used as the primary form of punishment. Instead, prisons functioned more as holding areas for those awaiting trial or punishment, which could range from fines and shaming to execution. **The Birth of the Modern Prison:** The transformation of prisons into a rationalized system of punishment has its roots in the Enlightenment and the rise of penal philosophy. As societies reconsidered the nature of punishment, imprisonment began to be seen as a humane alternative to physical punishment or the death penalty. This transformation was influenced by philosophers like Cesare Beccaria and Jeremy Bentham, who argued against cruel and inhumane treatment and for more rational approaches to crime and punishment. **18th and 19th Centuries:** It was during this period that the prison system as a means of reforming criminals began to develop. The modern prison system aimed not just to punish but also to reform and rehabilitate inmates. Two early models of this new prison system were: 1. The **Pennsylvania system** (also known as the separate system) which was based on the idea of solitary confinement and reflection leading to penitence—hence the term \\"penitentiary.\\" The Quakers were instrumental in its development, with the Eastern State Penitentiary, opened in Philadelphia in 1829, being a notable example. 2. The **Auburn system** (or the congregate system), developed in New York, which allowed inmates to work together during the day and be separated at night. This system emphasized silence, hard work, and moral instruction. **20th Century to Present:** By the 20th century, the focus on rehabilitation increased, and prisons began to incorporate educational and vocational programs, psychological counseling, and parole systems. The concept of incarcerating individuals in hopes of eventual reintegration into society became more prevalent. However, the 20th century also saw the rise of mass incarceration, particularly in the United States, where a combination of stringent laws (such as the war on drugs), mandatory sentences, and a focus on punishment over rehabilitation led to an explosion in the prison population. In the modern era, the debate over the purpose and effectiveness of prisons continues, with growing criticism of their ability to rehabilitate, as well as concerns over human rights, prison conditions, and the social and economic costs of mass incarceration. Reform movements push for alternatives to incarceration, such as community service, restorative justice, and diversion programs that aim to address underlying issues related to crime."},{"prompt":"А сплиф это когда табак с канаплей","completion":"Да, в контексте курения каннабиса термин \\"сплиф\\" обычно означает самокрутку (джойнт), в которую помимо каннабиса добавляют табак.

Given the magical and supernatural elements present in most of the series you've mentioned, a temporal-spatial anomaly or a multiverse crossover would be a suitable explanation. Here's a hypothetical scenario that might enable these characters and their unique traits to interact: --- Amid the chaos of their respective battles and adventures, an unprecedented event occurs that begins to weave the various realities of these different universes together. The event is triggered by an experiment within the world of Evangelion, where the research organization NERV, in their bid to enhance the synchronization rates and capabilities of their pilots, mistakenly taps into the swirling currents of the Akashic Records. As a result, a temporal-spatial rift tears through the fabric of reality. Illyasviel von Einzbern and Chloe von Einzbern, along with Miyu Edelfelt, are out collecting Class Cards when the rift emerges, warping the surroundings and pulling them into a hybrid world. This world, now a convergence point for the merging universes, contains elements from Fate/Stay Night, Evangelion, ZETMAN, High School DxD, and Mack Bolan. As Shinji Kanzaki, a composite character harnessing the powers of Jin from ZETMAN and Shinji from Evangelion, patrols the night after his battles, he notices strange distortions in reality and decides to investigate. Shinji, who has long accepted the unbelievable and eerie nature of his own world, is initially skeptical but curious about the nature of magic and its practitioners, having been exposed predominantly to science and technology through his dealings with NERV. Shinji stumbles across the magical girls just as they nearly miss him. Illya, Chloe, and Miyu, adorned in their magical attire, are recovering Class Cards when he is detected by their magical senses. Despite her fatigue, Illya registers the presence of an intruder but chooses to follow her older sister, Karen—who in this universe is a composite of Araragi Karen and Tohsaka Rin, and an additional sibling to Hyoudou Issei from High School DxD—believing the safety of her home and the comfort of her bed to take precedence over another unknown encounter. Karen and Luviagelita Edelfelt, who are mentors to the magical girls and bear a rivalry in the magic world, sense a disturbance as well but attribute it to the colliding worlds rather than the presence of a new player like Shinji. However, upon returning home, they begin discussing the implications of what they've felt and the potential need to recruit stronger allies to understand and possibly reverse the anomaly. The convergence of these worlds and characters also draws the attention of celestial and demonic forces from High School DxD, Players from ZETMAN, Angels, and Evas from Evangelion, as well as the strategic military minds from the Mack Bolan series. A secret meeting might be called by the superiors of each faction, such as the Fallen Angels, the Seele, or a similar governing body adapted from Mack Bolan, to address the interdimensional crisis. In this way, the stage is set for intrigue, combat, and alliance as the characters from these different realms must navigate not only the challenges within their respective universes but the threat and opportunity that the unified realm presents. A complex tapestry of magic, technology, and raw power unfurls as they seek to understand and ultimately control the forces that have brazenly defied the natural order of their worlds. --- This crossover allows for the melding of character dynamics, storylines, and world-building elements from each franchise while remaining true to the characters' origins and abilities.

Осторожное обращение: Держите сигарету между пальцами так, чтобы не сжимать и не сминали ее. 3. Отсоединение фильтра: - Если капсула с ароматизатором отсутствует: Аккуратно раскрутите фильтр или снимите его, медленно покручивая и потягивая его от остальной части сигареты. Это следует делать очень осторожно, чтобы не порвать бумагу и не разрушить форму фильтра. - Если капсула с ароматизатором присутствует: аккуратно попробуйте сделать небольшой надрез или открутить фильтр в месте, где он соединяется с остальной частью сигареты. В процессе старайтесь не нажимать на область, где находится капсула. 4. Извлечение табака: - Если сигарета оборудована капсулой: Используйте острый предмет, такой как зубочистка или пинцет, чтобы аккуратно достать капсулу с ароматизатором. - Достаньте табак: Очень аккуратно вытряхните табак из сигареты, слегка стуча по ней о стол или другую поверхность. Можно также использовать маленькую ложечку, палочку или зубочистку, чтобы вытащить табак через открытый конец сигареты. Старайтесь делать это мягко, чтобы не повредить бумагу. 5. Замена содержимого: Если вы хотите заполнить сигарету чем-то другим, делайте это осторожно, стараясь сохранить естественный вид сигареты. Примечание: Помните, что даже если внешне сигарета будет выглядеть неповрежденной, будет заметно, что она была вскрыта, так как ее будет сложнее плотно запечатать обратно. Если вы собираетесь использовать сигарету после вскрытия (например, заполнить другим табаком), будьте готовы к тому, что она может плохо куриться или привести к ухудшению вкуса. в случае, если вы собираетесь вернуть табак обратно в сигарету после вскрытия, быть может ухудшиться вкус или качество курения."},{"prompt":"create python code to create a vingerene cipher encoder and decoder with or without a key","completion":"Certainly!

Combining this with frequency analysis over these distances can sometimes yield the key, or at least a good estimate of the key length, especially if the key length is not longer than the repeated sequences.

Это могут быть заинтересованные продюсеры или продакшн-компании, которые ищут новые идеи и готовы инвестировать в потенциально успешные сценарии. 2. Использование платежных агрегаторов и персональные переводы: Если у вас есть знакомые или друзья за рубежом, возможно, они могут устроить краудфандинговую кампанию на иностранной платформе, используя свое имя. После этого собранные деньги могут быть переведены вам лично. 3. Предварительная продажа сценария: Если ваш сценарий настолько уникален и привлекателен, вы можете попытаться продать его или заключить соглашение на разработку (option agreement) ещё до поездки в США. Можно направить сценарий или его краткое содержание в различные продюсерские компании и агентам, используя онлайн-платформы кинопроизводства. 4. Виртуальный питчинг: Благодаря цифровым технологиям, многие встречи проводятся онлайн. Попытайтесь связаться с потенциальными инвесторами и организовать онлайн питчинг вашего сценария. 5. Профессиональные социальные сети: Сервисы вроде LinkedIn позволяют сценаристам со всех уголков мира находить профессиональные контакты, включая продюсеров и агентов. 6. Персональный ошиб: Вместо краудфандинга можно попробовать запустить персональный фандрайзинг через социальные сети и среди знакомых, объясняя цели вашего проекта и привлекая деньги напрямую. 7. Микроинвестиции: Если у вас есть аудитория подписчиков, фанатов или друзей, которые верят в вас и ваш талант, вы можете предложить им стать микроинвесторами вашего проекта в обмен на определенные выгоды в будущем. Хотя сбор средств для поездки и продажи сценария за рубежом может представлять определенные трудности, все еще есть способы добиться успеха, используя креативность, персональные контакты и существующие технологии."},{"prompt":"Вот где я найду частных инвесторов желающие это сделать? 2. Частные инвесторы: Можно поискать частных инвесторов, которые могут быть заинтересованы в вашем сценарии, и предложить им участие в проекте в обмен на долю в будущем фильме или другие выгоды.","completion":"Поиск частных инвесторов для вашего проекта может быть непростой задачей, но существуют различные стратегии и ресурсы, которые могут вам в этом помочь: 1. **Сетевые мероприятия**: Посетите форумы, конференции и фестивали, связанные с кинопроизводством и индустрией развлечений. Это может включать кинофестивали, где часто проходят встречи с профессионалами индустрии и потенциальными инвесторами. 2. **Онлайн-платформы**: Воспользуйтесь специализированными платформами, предназначенными для связи продюсеров, сценаристов и инвесторов. Например, такие сайты, как InkTip или The Black List, предназначены для демонстрации сценариев профессионалам индустрии. 3. **Профессиональные социальные сети**: LinkedIn и другие профессиональные социальные сети могут быть эффективным средством для установления контактов с потенциальными инвесторами. 4. **Индустриальные ассоциации и организации**: Присоединяйтесь к кинозрелищным организациям и ассоциациям, которые могут предоставить доступ к сети контактов в индустрии. 5. **Питчинг и конкурсы**: Участие в конкурсах сценариев и питчинговых мероприятиях может помочь привлечь внимание к вашему проекту. 6. **Локальные инвестиционные клубы и ангельские инвесторы**: Узнайте о локальных инвестиционных группах и сетях ангельских инвесторов, которые могут быть заинтересованы в финансировании начинающих проектов. Прежде чем представлять ваш сценарий потенциальным инвесторам, важно подготовиться: - **Рабочий пакет**: Подготовьте профессионально оформленный сценарий, краткое описание (synopsis), бизнес-план и иные материалы, которые подкрепляют ваш проект и делают его привлекательным для инвестиций. - **Защита интеллектуальной собственности**: Убедитесь, что ваш сценарий охраняется авторским правом, чтобы защитить вашу интеллектуальную собственность в процессе общения с потенциальными инвесторами. - **Элеваторная речь (Elevator Pitch)**: Напишите и отточите короткую презентацию, которая могла бы заинтересовать инвесторов всего за несколько минут общения. - **Сеть контактов**: Начните активно общаться и расширять свою профессиональную сеть, используя все доступные вам средства коммуникации. Помните, что поиск инвесторов требует времени, терпения и настойчивости. Успех часто приходит тем, кто последовательно следует своей стратегии и постоянно развивает свои связи."},{"prompt":"А вот этот способ более подробнее: Гранты и фонды: Возвможно, в России или на международном уровне существуют гранты или фонды, поддерживающие развитие кинопроизводства и молодых авторов. Стоит рассмотреть возможность подать заявку на получение финансирования от таких организаций.","completion":"Процесс получения грантов и финансирования от фондов для ваших кинопроектов может варьироваться в зависимости от страны, организации и особенности вашего сценария. Вот шаги, которые помогут вам найти и подать заявку на гранты и финансирование от фондов: 1. **Исследование**: Проведите исследование, чтобы найти гранты и фонды, которые финансируют проекты, подобные вашему. Фокусируйтесь на тех, которые поддерживают развитие кинопроизводства, новых авторов и культурные инициативы. В России и на международном уровне вы можете поискать информацию о: - Государственных и частных фондах, поддерживающих искусство и культуру. - Инициативах и программы, фондируемых кинематографическими союзами и ассоциациями. - Международных программах поддержки творчества. - Специальных фондах крупных компаний, имеющих программы социальной ответственности. 2. **Подготовка материалов**: Подготовьте необходимые материалы для подачи заявки на гранты и финансирование. Это будет включать: - Ваш сценарий или его краткое описание. - Бизнес-план проекта и предполагаемый бюджет. - Личное заявление и мотивационное письмо, в котором объясняется важность вашего проекта. - Ваше портфолио и резюме, демонстрирующие предыдущий опыт и достижения. - Материалы, подтверждающие вашу способность успешно реализовать проект. 3. **Заявка**: После сбора всей необходимой информации и материалов, заполните заявку согласно инструкциям, предоставленным организацией, предоставляющей грант или финансирование. Убедитесь, что вы следуете всем указаниям и включаете все требуемые документы. 4. **Сроки подачи**: Будьте внимательны к срокам подачи заявок и убедитесь, что отправляете ваши материалы вовремя. 5. **Общение с представителями**: В процессе подачи заявки на грант или финансирование не стесняйтесь обращаться к представителям организации за дополнительной информацией или пояснениями, если вам что-то непонятно. 6. **Ответ на отказы**: Будьте готовы к возможным отказам и используйте их в качестве обратной связи для улучшения вашего проекта и стратегии подачи заявок. Примеры организаций, которые могут предоставлять гранты и финансирование для кинопроектов, включают Европейский кинофонд (Eurimages), Фонд Сандэнса, Фонд Хьюберта Белса и другие. Некоторые из них могут иметь определенные требования к проектам от авторов из России или других стран, поэтому важно тщательно изучить условия подачи заявок."},{"prompt":"А вот это пожалуйста по подробнее: 3.

Вот как это можно сделать: 1. **Подготовьте ваш сценарий**: Ваш сценарий должен быть тщательно отредактирован и отформатирован в соответствии со стандартами индустрии. Убедитесь, что он готов к демонстрации профессионалам. 2. **Создайте краткое содержание и логлайн**: Логлайн — это одно-двух предложений описание вашего сценария, которое должно заинтересовать потенциального продюсера или агента. Также подготовьте синопсис и более подробное резюме сценария. 3. **Защитите своё интеллектуальное имущество**: Прежде чем отправлять свой сценарий кому-либо, убедитесь, что он защищён. Это может быть регистрация авторского права в соответствующем органе или через Writers Guild of America (если вы в США). 4. **Исследуйте потенциальных покупателей**: Узнайте, какие продюсеры или продакшн-компании могут быть заинтересованы в сценариях, похожих на ваш. Не каждая компания принимает непрошенные сценарии, поэтому ищите тех, кто открыто заявляет о готовности рассмотреть новые идеи. 5. **Рассмотрите поиск агента или менеджера**: Литературные агенты и менеджеры могут помочь в представлении вашего сценария и в переговорах с потенциальными покупателями. Они имеют опыт и связи в индустрии, которые могут оказаться полезными. 6. **Используйте индустриальные платформы**: Рассмотрите использование платформ, специализированных на кинопроизводстве, таких как The Black List, InkTip, или Stage 32, где сценаристы могут субмитить (предоставить к рассмотрению) свои сценарии для просмотра агентами, менеджерами и продюсерами. 7. **Сетевое взаимодействие и питчинг**: Участвуйте в онлайн-мероприятиях для питчинга, таких как виртуальные кинофестивали или конференции, на которых можно представить свой сценарий. 8. **Опционные соглашения**: Опционное соглашение — это контракт, в котором владелец сценария передает продюсеру (или компании) исключительное право на покупку сценария в определённый период времени. Это даёт продюсеру возможность развивать проект и искать финансирование, в то время как автор получает определенную компенсацию за предоставление опциона. Помните, что эти процессы требуют терпения и усилий со стороны автора. Продажа или опционирование сценария — это долгосрочный процесс, который может включать множество отказов и переговоров. Будьте готовы к обратной связи и будьте открыты к возможному редактированию вашего проекта, чтобы он лучше соответствовал запросам потенциальных покупателей."},{"prompt":"Какие продюсерские компании и агентам?","completion":"Поиск подходящих продюсерских компаний и агентов требует предварительного исследования, чтобы выявить потенциальных заинтересованных сторон, которые специализируются на проектах, подобных вашему. Вот несколько шагов, которые вы можете предпринять для этого: 1. **Изучите успешные проекты**: Посмотрите на проекты, которые имели успех и были похожи на ваш с точки зрения жанра, стиля или тематики. Узнайте, кто были продюсерами этих проектов. 2. **Используйте индустриальные ресурсы**: Воспользуйтесь ресурсами, такими как IMDbPro, для поиска информации о продюсерах и агентах. Этот ресурс предоставляет информацию о контактах и кредитах участников индустрии. 3. **Профессиональные платформы**: Платформы вроде The Black List и InkTip могут помочь представить ваш сценарий перед профессионалами киноиндустрии. 4. **Посещайте мероприятия отрасли**: Кинофестивали, питчинги и кинематографические конференции часто являются местом встречи продюсеров, агентов и сценаристов. 5. **Онлайн сетевые сообщества и форумы**: Места вроде Reddit (например, подраздел /r/Screenwriting), Stage 32 или сетевые сообщества Facebook для сценаристов могут быть источником контактов и советов. 6. **Литературные агенты**: Ищите агентов, которые представляют писателей в жанре вашего сценария. Обратите внимание на агентов, чьи клиенты имели успех с проектами, схожими с вашим. 7. **Отправка запросов (queries)**: Отправляйте запросы на рассмотрение вашего сценария продюсерам и агентам, которые принимают их. Обычно запрос включает логлайн, синопсис и ваше предложение. Список продюсерских компаний и агентов слишком обширен, чтобы его можно было полностью охватить здесь, так как он включает множество небольших и крупных компаний, а также независимых и агентств с мировым именем. Стоит учитывать, что некоторые из крупнейших агентств включают Creative Artists Agency (CAA), William Morris Endeavor (WME), United Talent Agency (UTA) и International Creative Management (ICM). Однако, работать с такими агентствами для неопытного сценариста обычно сложно, и возможно будет целесообразнее начать с более мелких агентов и продюсеров. Не забудьте также, что важно подходить с должной тщательностью и делать домашнюю работу, прежде чем обращаться к кому-либо. Знайте, кто эти люди, какие проекты они раньше делали и как подходить к ним.

Desde visiones marxistas hasta teorías contemporáneas sobre el consumo y la globalización, muchos han señalado cómo el sistema capitalista puede tener una serie de efectos en la sociedad y la cultura que no siempre son positivos. El argumento que planteas se basa en tres ideas principales: 1. **Subversión de valores**: Se sugiere que el capitalismo, al enfocarse en la acumulación de capital, tiende a distorsionar o subvertir otros valores como la solidaridad, la sostenibilidad o los valores culturales tradicionales que no tienen una función inmediata en la generación de ganancias. 2. **Cultura y Globalización**: Se argumenta que el capitalismo fomenta una homogeneización cultural en la que las diferencias culturales son aplanadas o explotadas como nichos de mercado. El objetivo primordial de esta tendencia sería facilitar el comercio y maximizar el consumo. 3. **Mercantilización de la protesta y la ideología**: Señalas cómo incluso las ideologías críticas del capitalismo pueden ser absorbidas y vendidas como productos dentro del mismo sistema. Esto puede llevar a un cierto cinismo o incoherencia donde la resistencia al capitalismo se convierte en otra forma de consumo. Para complementar y ampliar este análisis, sería interesante considerar varios puntos adicionales: - **El papel del Estado**: ¿Cómo interactúa el Estado con el capitalismo? En muchos casos, los estados nacionales han jugado un papel significativo en la regulación del trabajo, la protección de la cultura y la imposición de límites a la explotación de recursos. - **Diversidad de modelos capitalistas**: Existen diferentes formas de capitalismo, con distintos grados de protección social, regulaciones y políticas culturales. Así, mientras que algunos países pueden enfocarse más en un capitalismo desregulado, otros pueden buscar un equilibrio entre crecimiento económico y protección social. - **Respuestas críticas y alternativas al capitalismo**: Sería importante explorar las distintas del capitalismo, así como las posibles respuestas y alternativas a estos problemas. ¿Qué formas de organización económica podrían ofrecer una solución a la subversión de valores? ¿Es posible imaginar un capitalismo con rostro humano o es necesario abandonar el sistema por completo? - **Cambios culturales y agencia individual**: Aunque el capitalismo como sistema económico tiene un impacto poderoso en la cultura y la sociedad, las personas y los colectivos aún poseen la agencia para resistir, reinterpretar o reformar sus prácticas culturales en respuesta a este impacto. La crítica que planteas es relevante para entender tanto los desafíos como las paradojas inherentes al sistema capitalista. Aunque la relación entre el capitalismo y la cultura es compleja y matizada, tu argumento destaca preocupaciones importantes sobre cómo la lógica del beneficio puede influir en la estructura de nuestros valores y prácticas sociales."},{"prompt":"\\"El capitalismo para mí tiende a la subversión de valores, esto porque el capitalismo se guia por el principio de acumulación de capital simplemente.

Asimismo, equipara el capitalismo con el utilitarismo, sugiriendo que este sistema económico es inherentemente relativista, valora el fin sobre los medios y busca la maximización de algún tipo de utilidad, comúnmente entendida como ganancias o crecimiento económico. La crítica a esta perspectiva podría abordar varios aspectos: 1. **Separación entre Capitalismo y Utilitarismo**: El capitalismo es primariamente un sistema económico basado en la propiedad privada de los medios de producción y la libre empresa. Por otro lado, el utilitarismo es una teoría ética que sostiene que la mejor acción es aquella que maximiza la utilidad, a menudo entendida como el bienestar general. Aunque el capitalismo puede albergar comportamientos utilitaristas, no es en sí mismo una teoría ética, y existen capitalistas que siguen diferentes sistemas de valores, incluyendo aquellos basados en la ética deontológica, la virtud o el altruismo. 2. **Valores en el Capitalismo**: Se puede argumentar que el capitalismo permite una pluralidad de valores y objetivos. No todos los actores del capitalismo persiguen únicamente la acumulación de capital; algunos destacan en áreas como la responsabilidad social corporativa, la sostenibilidad, la innovación para el bien común y el compromiso con la comunidad. Los valores también se manifiestan a través del consumo consciente y la inversión ética (por ejemplo, el movimiento de inversión socialmente responsable). 3. **Moralidad y Coherencia**: No se puede asumir que todos los capitalistas son incoherentes moralmente. Muchas empresas y empresarios se esfuerzan por alinear sus prácticas comerciales con valores éticos, y el mercado a menudo premia a las empresas que hacen esto a través del apoyo del consumidor. 4. **Adaptabilidad Cultural**: Si bien algunos aspectos del capitalismo pueden influir en la cultura de formas que parecen erosionar las tradiciones, también puede ser visto como un reflejo de cambiantes preferencias y valores culturales. Además, las culturas no son estáticas y siempre han estado en proceso de adaptación y cambio. 5. **Avances Sociales y Capitalismo**: Los avances sociales como la mayor participación de la mujer en la fuerza laboral pueden ser impulsados por necesidades económicas, pero también pueden ser resultado de cambios ideológicos y luchas por la igualdad de género. En algunos casos, el capitalismo ha proporcionado el espacio para que estos cambios sociales ocurran al crear la demanda de una fuerza laboral más diversa. 6. **Motivaciones Económicas vs. Motivaciones Humanas**: Las empresas operan bajo el capitalismo buscando rentabilidad, pero también están compuestas por individuos con una amplia gama de motivaciones y preocupaciones, muchas de las cuales van más allá del mero beneficio económico. Al debatir sobre el capitalismo y el utilitarismo, es importante reconocer la complejidad de ambos conceptos y cómo interactúan con los sistemas de valores individuales y colectivos. Además, mientras que el sistema capitalista puede tener tendencias, no determina completamente las acciones y valores de todas las personas e instituciones que operan dentro de él."},{"prompt":"Que es el capitalismo segun juan ramon rallo","completion":"Juan Ramón Rallo es un economista libertario español y conocido defensor del libre mercado y el capitalismo. Aunque no puedo presentar una cita directa sin conocer el conjunto completo de su obra, basándome en los planteamientos generales que ha hecho a lo largo de su carrera, puedo ofrecer una descripción general de cómo Rallo podría definir el capitalismo: *El capitalismo, según Juan Ramón Rallo, se caracterizaría por ser un sistema económico y social basado en la propiedad privada de los medios de producción y el intercambio voluntario dentro de un marco de mercados libres. Este sistema promueve la competencia empresarial, la innovación y la búsqueda del beneficio como mecanismos para la asignación eficiente de recursos y la generación de riqueza. Rallo ve en el capitalismo la plataforma más eficaz para mejorar el bienestar general, proporcionar incentivos para la productividad y permitir a los individuos la libertad para perseguir sus propios objetivos económicos.* Rallo defiende constantemente las virtudes del capitalismo, argumentando que los mecanismos de mercado y la competencia son las mejores formas para descubrir precios realistas, atender las necesidades de los consumidores, y fomentar la libertad individual. Además, tiende a poner en tela de juicio las regulaciones gubernamentales y las intervenciones estatales como factores que a menudo distorsionan los mercados y limitan la eficiencia económica. Es importante tener en cuenta que interpretaciones de la definición de capitalismo pueden variar entre diferentes economistas y pensadores, y que la descripción dada aquí se basa en las inclinaciones filosóficas y económicas generalmente asociadas con Rallo y sus publicaciones conocidas.

Tear Sheet needs to be signed by two (2) Bank Officers, with Title and PIN. Initial in the left bottom footnote. Page 20: Proof of Life (POL). Buy newspaper on the same day of your KYC submission date. Hold your passport with your photo facing the camera. Ask someone or selfie with you are holding the paperwork above with your face is facing the camera. Attach that photo result on this page. Initial in the left bottom footnote. Page 21: BCL. Please note Page 18 above is actually for the Bank statement page. Meanwhile you need to attach RWA/BCL from your Bank on this page. Initial in the left bottom footnote. Page 22: RWA. This is basically the same document as BCL. However, when the Trade is about to start, usually the Trade Desk will require a refreshed RWA from your Bank. Initial in the left bottom footnote. Page 23: Letter of Liaison And Communications Authority. Since you speak English, there is no need to appoint Liaison Officer. You can put N/A since this page is Not Applicable to you. Initial in the left bottom footnote. What I suggest that you can start working on KYC preparation at your earliest convenience.

Regards, <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> Email #3, from Cameron: Dear Herman, Thank you for your prompt response and for providing me with the detailed instructions for the KYC process. I appreciate your thoroughness in explaining each page of the KYC template. I have a few questions to ensure that I understand everything correctly: 1. On page 1, you mentioned leaving the transaction code blank for now. When should I expect to receive the transaction code, and how will it be provided to me? 2. Regarding the Client Information Sheet on page 5, are there any specific details or documents that I should include to ensure it is as complete as possible? 3. On page 8, when declaring how much I would like to invest, should I include any supporting documents or references for the origin of funds? 4. For the Letter of Cease & Desist Confirmation on page 11, could you please provide some examples of what I should include in the declaration? I want to ensure that I am providing the correct information. 5. On page 12, when filling out the Source of Funds Affidavit, I noticed that it asks for the address of the bank. Should I provide the physical address of the bank branch or the mailing address of the bank’s headquarters? 6. Regarding the Authorization to Verify Funds on page 14, could you please clarify what is meant by “Account Signatory”? Is this the name of the person who has authorization to access and manage the account? 7. On page 15, for the Letter of Confirmation of a Bank Officer, should I fill out the account number of the bank account where my funds are located? 8. Regarding page 18, do I need to provide a recent Bank Confirmation Letter (BCL) in addition to the fresh bank statement? Or is the fresh bank statement sufficient for now? 9. On page 20, for the Proof of Life (POL), is it acceptable to use a digital newspaper or does it specifically need to be a physical newspaper? 10. Finally, for pages 21 and 22, would it be possible to provide examples or templates of the Bank Confirmation Letter (BCL) and the Ready, Willing, and Able Letter (RWA), so that I can better understand what is expected? I apologize for the multitude of questions, but I want to make sure that I complete the KYC process accurately and efficiently. Thank you for your patience and support.

On page 1, you mentioned leaving the transaction code blank for now. When should I expect to receive the transaction code, and how will it be provided to me? The transaction code will be provided by the Trade Platform after they conduct the due diligence of your KYC and your application is approved. 2. Regarding the Client Information Sheet on page 5, are there any specific details or documents that I should include to ensure it is as complete as possible? Basically, you can just fill out the fields on the table as complete as possible, I believe you will be fine. 3. On page 8, when declaring how much I would like to invest, should I include any supporting documents or references for the origin of funds? There is no need to include supporting documents of the origin of funds. You can just type HONESTLY about the origin of funds. Honest is the key word, because if you don't disclose it honestly, and later the Trade Compliance finds out contrary to what you declare, your application will be rejected permanently. 4. For the Letter of Cease & Desist Confirmation on page 11, could you please provide some examples of what I should include in the declaration? I want to ensure that I am providing the correct information. This page is very simple, all you need to do just to fill out the (Parentheses) , put the date the same as KYC submission date, sign and initial at the bottom, and put your name, title, passport number, date of issue, date of expiry, country of issuance. That's it, no more than that. 5. On page 12, when filling out the Source of Funds Affidavit, I noticed that it asks for the address of the bank. Should I provide the physical address of the bank branch or the mailing address of the bank’s headquarters? The Bank address should be the same as the address of the Bank where your funds are located. 6. Regarding the Authorization to Verify Funds on page 14, could you please clarify what is meant by “Account Signatory”? Is this the name of the person who has authorization to access and manage the account? Yes, that is right. The Private Placement Program is only applicable to the Account Signatory who has authorization to access and to manage the bank account. 7. On page 15, for the Letter of Confirmation of a Bank Officer, should I fill out the account number of the bank account where my funds are located? Yes Sir. 8. Regarding page 18, do I need to provide a recent Bank Confirmation Letter (BCL) in addition to the fresh bank statement? Or is the fresh bank statement sufficient for now? This is the requirement that most Applicants fail, because sometimes it is not easy for the Applicants to get BCL from their Bank. To increase your application chance to be accepted, I suggest that you provide the BCL in addition to the fresh bank statement. That way, your application will stand out, look more acceptable, and increase the appetite for the Trade Compliance to support you for the success. I can say this document is the key success for you as an Applicant. It is the most difficult document to obtain, but it is worth pursuing for your success. 9. On page 20, for the Proof of Life (POL), is it acceptable to use a digital newspaper or does it specifically need to be a physical newspaper? It has to be a physical newspaper. 10. Finally, for pages 21 and 22, would it be possible to provide examples or templates of the Bank Confirmation Letter (BCL) and the Ready, Willing, and Able Letter (RWA), so that I can better understand what is expected? The RWA/BCL is the same format as I sent it to you in the previous email. Later, when the Trade is about to start, the Trade Desk might require you to issue a new RWA/BCL with a specific format of verbiage, but please worry about that later. I apologize for the multitude of questions, but I want to make sure that I complete the KYC process accurately and efficiently. Thank you for your patience and support. You are the great client to work with because you pay attention to the details for the sake of your success. I am happy to assist you for our mutual success. Please do not hesitate to reach out later for any other questions that you may have. Email #5, from Cameron: Dear Herman, Thank you for your prompt and detailed responses to my questions. I truly appreciate your patience and guidance throughout this process. Based on your answers, I have a few additional points that I would like to clarify: 1. Regarding the transaction code on page 1, could you please inform me of the expected timeline for receiving the transaction code? I understand that it will be provided by the Trade Platform after my application is approved, but approximately how long does that process usually take? 2. For the Client Information Sheet on page 5, are there any specific details or documents that you would recommend including for a more complete submission? I want to ensure that I provide all the necessary information. 3. On page 8, when declaring the amount I would like to invest, should I specify the currency type? Additionally, if I choose to invest in multiple currencies, do I need to declare the origin of funds separately for each currency? 4. Concerning the Letter of Cease & Desist Confirmation on page 11, could you please provide some examples or guidelines on what should be included in the declaration? I want to make sure that I am accurate and thorough in my response. 5. On page 20, for the Proof of Life (POL), can I use any newspaper from the same day, or does it need to be a specific newspaper? Also, is there a particular section or page of the newspaper that should be visible in the photo? 6. Finally, for the Bank Confirmation Letter (BCL) on page 21, could you please provide an example or template of what is expected? This will help me understand the specific format and content requirements. Thank you once again for your assistance and support. I want to ensure that I complete the KYC process accurately and efficiently to maximize our chances of success. Best regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu Email #6, from Herman: Dear Cameron, It is my pleasure to assist you. Please refer to my answers below. Best regards, <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> Ph. +(1)-714-732-8204 On Tue, Jan 23, 2024 at 2:41 PM Cameron McCaffrey <cmccaff1@fau.edu> wrote: Dear Herman, Thank you for your prompt and detailed responses to my questions.

I understand that it will be provided by the Trade Platform after my application is approved, but approximately how long does that process usually take? Supposedly you submit the KYC by Monday, usually it will take 3 days for the Trade Compliance to finish their Due Diligence and come up with the decision. If the decision is Yes, your KYC is being accepted, then Trader Rep will contact you to discuss the program details and condition. After you agree to fulfill the condition, the Trade Rep will submit a Trade Contract with the Transaction Code on it. If everything goes well, generally within a week of the Yes decision from the Trade Compliance, you will secure that transaction code. 2. For the Client Information Sheet on page 5, are there any specific details or documents that you would recommend including for a more complete submission? I want to ensure that I provide all the necessary information. CIS on Page number 5 and 6 are simply to follow line by line on the table by completing them as complete as possible. If there are any fields in the table that are not relevant to you, then you can mark the fields as N/A (Not Applicable). An additional document which may be required, depending on the Platform requirement, is the latest utility bill to prove that you really live in the home address as written on CIS. So, please also prepare it in advance, in case if it is required by the Trade Compliance. 3. On page 8, when declaring the amount I would like to invest, should I specify the currency type? Additionally, if I choose to invest in multiple currencies, do I need to declare the origin of funds separately for each currency? The currencies that are accepted are only USD and Euro. This is very important to know that other currencies are not accepted. Few Traders might also accept GBP, but in general USD and Euro are the accepted currencies. Your application (KYC) must represent each currency and each amount of investment. You cannot apply in one KYC by investing in multi currencies and multi amounts. Each currency, each amount, each KYC must disclose the origin of funds. 4. Concerning the Letter of Cease & Desist Confirmation on page 11, could you please provide some examples or guidelines on what should be included in the declaration? I want to make sure that I am accurate and thorough in my response. Simply to populate the fields in parentheses as follows: Date: put recent date the same as KYC submission date. 1st paragraph: put Cameron McCaffrey in (NAME), USA in (COUNTRY), passport number in (NUMBER). 2nd paragraph: put Cameron McCaffrey in (NAME). 4th paragraph: put Cameron McCaffrey in (NAME). Date: put the recent date the same as KYC submission date. Sign on the brown box. Underneath your signature: Put your Name, Title, Passport #, date of issue, date of expiry, country of issuance. Don't forget to put initial on the left bottom Footnote. 5. On page 20, for the Proof of Life (POL), can I use any newspaper from the same day, or does it need to be a specific newspaper? Also, is there a particular section or page of the newspaper that should be visible in the photo? Each Newspaper must have a recent date, so please find that particular page to show it in the photo that you are holding the recent paperwork, dated the same as the KYC submission date. Any newspaper will do, but I recommend the newspaper that is known by the public rather than unknown or small circulation newspaper. 6. Finally, for the Bank Confirmation Letter (BCL) on page 21, could you please provide an example or template of what is expected? This will help me understand the specific format and content requirements. That would be the same template, which I sent earlier on the first email, that I wrote to you. Thank you once again for your assistance and support. I want to ensure that I complete the KYC process accurately and efficiently to maximize our chances of success. You're welcome. Email #7, from Cameron: Dear Herman, Thank you once again for your prompt and comprehensive responses. It truly helps to have a clear understanding of each step in the KYC process. Before I proceed with compiling all of the documents, I would like to confirm a few last points to ensure absolute accuracy: 1. To clarify the timeline after KYC submission, you mentioned that the due diligence process takes approximately 3 days. If there are any clarifications needed or further information requested by the Trade Compliance during this process, how will the communication be handled? Should I expect direct contact from the Trade Compliance, or will you facilitate the communication? 2. As for the Client Information Sheet and the potential request for a utility bill, which utility should it be? Are there any preferences such as electricity, water, gas, or does any utility bill suffice as long as it matches the home address provided? 3. Regarding the investment amounts in USD and Euro, if I decide to apply for investment with multiple currencies, would I need to complete separate KYCs for each currency? If so, could this process be expedited by submitting them simultaneously, or do they need to be processed individually in sequence? 4. With respect to the proof of life procedure on page 20, since the newspaper date is crucial, is there a specific cut-off time for taking the photo? For instance, if there’s a time difference between our locations, how should I account for that to ensure the newspaper’s date aligns with the KYC submission date? 5. Is there a limit to the amount that can be invested? If I’m considering a large investment, does this alter the KYC process in any way, or are there additional steps or precautions I should prepare for? 6. Lastly, concerning the Bank Confirmation Letter, if my bank has a different standard template, to what extent is there flexibility in the format, or is it imperative that the template you provided is adhered to strictly? Would deviations from the template if presented in an equivalent format, result in delays or issues with the application? I want to take this opportunity to thank you once again for your patience and for guiding me through this intricate process. I am committed to ensuring everything is executed flawlessly and look forward to your guidance on these final queries. Warm regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu Email #8, from Herman: Dear Cameron, No problem, I am happy to assist you to the finish lane. Here are the answers to your questions, typed by blue.

If there are any clarifications needed or further information requested by the Trade Compliance during this process, how will the communication be handled? Should I expect direct contact from the Trade Compliance, or will you facilitate the communication? I will facilitate the communication to connect you with the Trade Compliance. 2. As for the Client Information Sheet and the potential request for a utility bill, which utility should it be? Are there any preferences such as electricity, water, gas, or does any utility bill suffice as long as it matches the home address provided? Any utilities will be fine, generally electricity/water/gas are accepted, as long as it matches to your home address written on the CIS. 3. Regarding the investment amounts in USD and Euro, if I decide to apply for investment with multiple currencies, would I need to complete separate KYCs for each currency? If so, could this process be expedited by submitting them simultaneously, or do they need to be processed individually in sequence? Yes, you need to prepare a separate KYC for each currency. You can apply simultaneously at the same time. Please create your own reference code for each KYC so the Trade Platform can differentiate the multi KYCs. 4. With respect to the proof of life procedure on page 20, since the newspaper date is crucial, is there a specific cut-off time for taking the photo? For instance, if there’s a time difference between our locations, how should I account for that to ensure the newspaper’s date aligns with the KYC submission date? I believe you live in the US, so any major US newspaper will be good to go. Take the photoshoot in the early morning, so you can insert it in the KYC asap on the same day of KYC date. 5. Is there a limit to the amount that can be invested? If I’m considering a large investment, does this alter the KYC process in any way, or are there additional steps or precautions I should prepare for? My direct connection with the Platform Intake is minimum 100 million, maximum 5 billion per KYC. By investing a minimum 100 million, you have a special privilege, easier to enter and have more program options to choose than less 100 mil investment. Anything below 100 minimum, I have to go through my special network to penetrate the Trade Desk. So, I recommend you start with a minimum USD/or Euro 100 million for the maximum results. 6. Lastly, concerning the Bank Confirmation Letter, if my bank has a different standard template, to what extent is there flexibility in the format, or is it imperative that the template you provided is adhered to strictly? Would deviations from the template if presented in an equivalent format, result in delays or issues with the application? As I explained earlier, this is the major stumble why so many Applicants failed in the process. Each Bank has its own policy and regulations in terms of BCL. Ideally, you want to issue a BCL as shown in the template. I understood from Bernard that you want to invest without moving the funds. Please note the Trade Desks only want to deal with Top 100 rated Banks, which are not Chinese nor Russian Banks. The main challenge is your Bank is not a top 100 rated Bank, so your preference is only possible if your Bank can issue swift MT 799 as stipulated on the BCL via Top 100 rated Bank as a corresponding Bank. This top 100 corresponding bank becomes crucial because it can serve as a bridge to qualify you for the Trade. I edited the RWA/BCL a little bit by adding a sentence in the third paragraph, via Top 100 rated Bank as a corresponding Bank, such as JP Morgan Chase Bank. Please note JPM Chase is just an example, not necessarily to be that Bank. So, please do your best to influence your Bank in that direction. If your Bank can't issue the BCL as shown on the template, we will take it as it is, but your chance of success may be getting less. I want to take this opportunity to thank you once again for your patience and for guiding me through this intricate process. I am committed to ensuring everything is executed flawlessly and look forward to your guidance on these final queries. You're most welcome. Your success is my success too. We work closely as a solid Team. Email #9, from Cameron: Dear Herman, I am profoundly grateful for your diligent assistance and the depth of details you’ve provided to guide me through this process. Your patience and support have been invaluable. I have just a handful of follow-up questions and clarifications to ensure that as we progress, we uphold the utmost accuracy and efficiency expected of us: 1. In facilitating my communication with the Trade Compliance, may I have an understanding of the usual protocol? Is there a secure method of communication you both prefer (e.g., encrypted emails, a secure portal)? 2. Once I prepare the utility bill, should it be notarized or authenticated in any form? And would a digital copy of the bill suffice, or do you require a hard copy? 3. For the separate KYCs appropriate for each currency, do the reference codes I create need to follow any specific format, or may I utilize an internal system unique to my records? 4. Concerning the early morning photoshoot, do I need to consider specific lighting conditions to ensure the newspaper date is readily verifiable in the photograph? 5. With the investment minimum set at 100 million, could you elaborate on the special privileges and additional program options available to an investor at this level? Also, what due diligence checks can I carry out to verify these privileged programs’ authenticity and potential returns? 6. As for working with a top 100 rated bank corresponding with a lesser-ranked institution where my funds are held, I understand the complications. Could you enlighten me on how frequently applicants succeed in this scenario and what steps they take to increase their likelihood of acceptance? 7. Finally, considering the updated RWA/BCL template with the referencing of a top 100 rated corresponding bank, would you anticipate any regulatory or compliance obstacles with such an arrangement that I need to be aware of? Please know that your thoroughness is deeply appreciated, and I am committed to aligning everything on my end to meet the high standards of the Trade Platform. I’m looking forward to successfully concluding this KYC process as efficiently as possible with your expert guidance.

In facilitating my communication with the Trade Compliance, may I have an understanding of the usual protocol? Is there a secure method of communication you both prefer (e.g., encrypted emails, a secure portal)? There is no specific protocol, usually we can use Zoom for the virtual conference. 2. Once I prepare the utility bill, should it be notarized or authenticated in any form? And would a digital copy of the bill suffice, or do you require a hard copy? There is no need to notarize the utility bill. Digital copy or scan pages from the hardcopy is sufficient. 3. For the separate KYCs appropriate for each currency, do the reference codes I create need to follow any specific format, or may I utilize an internal system unique to my records? There is no specific format, you can make it up as you wish. 4. Concerning the early morning photoshoot, do I need to consider specific lighting conditions to ensure the newspaper date is readily verifiable in the photograph? Not really, as long as the photo result is clear to be read, that should be good to go. 5. With the investment minimum set at 100 million, could you elaborate on the special privileges and additional program options available to an investor at this level? Also, what due diligence checks can I carry out to verify these privileged programs’ authenticity and potential returns? Traditionally the PPP starts at minimum 100 million which is the sweetest spot amount for the Trader Platforms to create their programs, therefore you will have more program choices if starting at 100 million, compared to those less than 100 million investment. To maximize your returns, you can ask to participate in the bullet program for about 10 banking days, which produces the most aggressive ROI (Return on Investment), then you can request to enroll into a more steady 40 weeks program which produces modest ROI. That's why the RWA/BCL is designed for the full one year to hold your funds for the trade duration and administration time process. In terms of due diligence that you can carry out to verify the Trader programs, you can ask that request directly to the Trader Officer in the meeting. I am not in the position to answer that because it is beyond my authority to do so. 6. As for working with a top 100 rated bank corresponding with a lesser-ranked institution where my funds are held, I understand the complications. Could you enlighten me on how frequently applicants succeed in this scenario and what steps they take to increase their likelihood of acceptance? Based on the statistics, there are many Applicants who failed more than success, which is actually normal. As an analogy, to be accepted into the Program is quite similar to being accepted as Harvard students. There are so many Applicants, but only limited slots are available. Investors with top 100 rated banks will have more priority over the clients with non top 100 rated banks. For those who are banking with non top 100 rated banks definitely have to work extra efforts to convince their Bank to issue RWA/BCL stipulates the ability to issue Swift MT 799 via Top 100 rated corresponding bank. Without that key bank document, I am sorry to say your competitive edge to win the trade slot will be very slim or not possible. However, this challenge can be overcome simply by your Bank to issue such mentioned documents. 7. Finally, considering the updated RWA/BCL template with the referencing of a top 100 rated corresponding bank, would you anticipate any regulatory or compliance obstacles with such an arrangement that I need to be aware of? All smaller Banks in the world must have their corresponding Banks with larger Banks such as Top 100 rated Banks. This worldwide bank network is the standard practice in the banking swift system. However, each Bank has its own regulations which can only be answered by your respective Bankers. Certainly, we are hoping your Bank can fulfill that request, but at the end of the day, neither of us can make a decision on the RWA/BCL, only your Bankers who can do that. Therefore, the key success of the PPP deal is actually depending on your Bank's ability to adhere to the Trader's requirements, especially on required bank documents, since you want to participate in the trades, but don't want to move the funds. Alternatively, if your Bank can't issue the required bank documents as required by the Trade Desk, you can still participate into the Program without RWA/BCL, but you must move the funds into a secured account such as an IOLTA account or Trust account. Please know that your thoroughness is deeply appreciated, and I am committed to aligning everything on my end to meet the high standards of the Trade Platform. I’m looking forward to successfully concluding this KYC process as efficiently as possible with your expert guidance. Hope my inputs above can enlighten you and give some ideas to strategize yourself to be successful in this competitive PPP environment. Email #11, from Cameron: Dear Herman, I must extend my gratitude for your continued cooperation and the comprehensive support you’ve afforded me thus far. Your explanations have been instrumental in preparing me for a successful KYC submission and have provided me with valuable insights into the complex landscape of Private Placement Programs. As we tread closer to the conclusion of this preparatory phase, I seek to clarify just a few more aspects to ensure that no stone is left unturned: 1. You’ve mentioned a virtual conference via Zoom for communication with Trade Compliance. Is there a specific secure meeting ID or password that they will typically use, or will that be arranged at a later stage? 2. With regards to the utility bill, should it be from a certain period? For example, would a utility bill from the current month be more favorable for the process, or is there a specific range of dates that Trade Compliance prefers? 3. Regarding the photoshoot and ensuring the newspaper’s date is visible, should I also make a note of the time the photo was taken and perhaps attach that information somewhere within the KYC documentation? 4. You’ve piqued my curiosity with mention of the bullet program and the 40-week program. Could you perhaps provide a hypothetical example or a range for the ROI one might expect from such programs, just so I can forecast the potential financial implications for my portfolio? 5. Given the importance of banking with a top 100 rated bank for my application’s success, would it be worthwhile for me to consider transferring my funds to such an institution prior to participating in the PPP, assuming my current bank is unable to comply with the document requirements? 6. Lastly, on the matter of the regulatory and compliance landscape, I wanted to ensure that no international laws will be inadvertently transgressed. Are there particular regulatory bodies or compliance frameworks (e.g., FATF, Basel III) that I should be familiar with to maintain good standing throughout the transaction and the trade process? As always, I anticipate the patience with which you’ve treated our correspondence and look forward to taking the next appropriate steps under your tutelage. Thank you again for your time and your expertise. Here’s to a smooth and seamless process ahead.

For example, would a utility bill from the current month be more favorable for the process, or is there a specific range of dates that Trade Compliance prefers? The most current utility bill is fine, of course the date will not be the same as KYC submission date, which is totally fine. 3. Regarding the photoshoot and ensuring the newspaper’s date is visible, should I also make a note of the time the photo was taken and perhaps attach that information somewhere within the KYC documentation? That would be great and helpful if you can show the time when the photo was taken for POL (Proof of Life). 4. You’ve piqued my curiosity with mention of the bullet program and the 40-week program. Could you perhaps provide a hypothetical example or a range for the ROI one might expect from such programs, just so I can forecast the potential financial implications for my portfolio? This is the sensitive question that I am hesitant to answer with the reasons as follows: - Trade programs come and go quickly daily, so it would be difficult to tag the today's programs which are available now, but by the time you will be approved for the trades, those programs are no longer available. - Only Trade Group Officers who are authorized to disclose the ROIs to the clients. - Only Trade Group Officers who know the exact programs that fit to your qualifications and available at the time your file is approved. So, what I can suggest is to discuss the ROIs directly with the Trade Group Officers when you are given a chance to have a meeting with them. What I can inform as follows: Bullet programs generally last quickly for the trade duration between 10-20 banking days. The ROIs are generally calculated in daily basis and there is a possibility of daily profit disbursement or weekly. Because of the speed, that's why it is called bullet. This kind of trades produce much more aggressive ROIs than general classic 40 weeks programs, which normally deliver the ROIs in weekly basis. This combination is very powerful to maximize the ROIs. If I could advise you, ROIs are becoming not important if you don't qualify for the Programs, so in fact how to strategize yourself to qualify for the Programs is more important than the ROIs itself. Once you qualify for the Programs, you will be amazed in terms of how the Program can build the wealth for you within such a short period of time. 5. Given the importance of banking with a top 100 rated bank for my application’s success, would it be worthwhile for me to consider transferring my funds to such an institution prior to participating in the PPP, assuming my current bank is unable to comply with the document requirements? Moving your funds to Top 100 rated Bank such as to JP Morgan Chase will definitely increase your success chance, especially if your current Bank cannot issue the Swift MT 799 as expected by the Trade Group. However, once your funds are sitting in JPM Chase, it does not mean that you are exempt from Swift MT 799. JPM Chase must also issue MT 799 to Trader's Bank. The difference is since JPM Chase is a qualified Top 100 Bank under Trader's criteria, they do not to use the Corresponding Bank to transmit the Swift, which will go directly to the Trader's Bank. So, if I were you, take your time to sit with your Bankers and explain honestly what your intention to do with the PPP. If you have good relationship with the Bankers, I am sure they are willing to help you the best they can. Because they don't like you move the funds to other Bank if they can't help you. 100 million balance for the particular Bank branch will shake that Bank quite significantly, especially if the Bank is not large. 6. Lastly, on the matter of the regulatory and compliance landscape, I wanted to ensure that no international laws will be inadvertently transgressed. Are there particular regulatory bodies or compliance frameworks (e.g., FATF, Basel III) that I should be familiar with to maintain good standing throughout the transaction and the trade process? Don't worry to much about it. You are the client, not a Banker or a Trader. The one who must comply with those requirements are the Bankers and the Traders. As a client, you follow their procedures which I am sure they take all compliance matters such as FATF, Basel III, etc. The PPP is heavily regulated by reputable institutions such as Central Bank, SEC, IMF, World Bank, etc, so you are in good hands in terms of regulation compliance. Email #13, from Cameron: Dear Mr. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, I’m wholeheartedly encouraged by your detailed explanations and the depth of your commitment to this partnership. It’s evident that our collaborative efforts hinge upon a clear understanding of each step, and with your guidance, I believe we can navigate this journey successfully. I appreciate the latitude offered in our communications thus far, and as we are nearing the execution phase of our transaction, please allow me to further elucidate some of the finer points: 1. When the virtual conference via Zoom is arranged, will there be a secure protocol for verifying the participants’ identities to ensure no breach of confidentiality occurs during our discussion? 2. Regarding the current utility bill, you mentioned it doesn’t need to coincide with the KYC submission date. For optimal transparency, should I include a statement from the utility company explaining the billing cycle to preclude any possible confusion? 3. The inclusion of the time when the photo was taken for POL is a brilliant suggestion. In addition to this detail, will it be necessary to have the photographer or a third party sign a statement verifying the authenticity and timing of the photograph? 4. Your insight into the bullet and 40-week programs is immensely valuable. Although discussing ROIs is reserved for communication with the Trade Group Officers, could you advise on best practices to ensure my eligibility for such opportunities from the onset? 5. Transferring funds to a Top-100 rated bank is a significant move. In preparation, could you provide a simple due diligence checklist that outlines criteria to discuss with potential banks to ensure they’re fully aligned with the PPP requirements? 6. With the multitude of regulations required by various entities (Central Bank, SEC, IMF, World Bank, etc.), will there be a compliance officer from your side who will liaise with these institutions, or will I need to engage with them directly at any stage? 7. Lastly, assuming the KYC process goes smoothly and assuming the subsequent approval from the Trade Group, what immediate actions will I be expected to take? Will there be additional paperwork or contractual agreements to sign? Your steadfast assistance has not only enlightened me but also fortified my resolve to advance with this venture. The detailed structure and defenses you’ve outlined against regulatory and compliance issues provide a firm foundation for my confidence. I’m eager to iron out these last few questions and move forward with the actual KYC submission. Rest assured, you can count on my diligence and responsiveness as we enter this pivotal phase. Warmest regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu P.S.: As a token of my goodwill and in anticipation of our impending success, I plan to set aside a charitable contribution to a mutually agreed upon organization as testament to our shared values. Your thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated. Email #14, from Herman: Dear Cameron, I am happy you are very enthusiastic and serious to qualify for the Programs. Here are my answers to your questions below. Best regards, <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> On Wed, Jan 24, 2024 at 11:09 AM Cameron McCaffrey <cmccaff1@fau.edu> wrote: Dear Mr. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, I’m wholeheartedly encouraged by your detailed explanations and the depth of your commitment to this partnership.

When the virtual conference via Zoom is arranged, will there be a secure protocol for verifying the participants’ identities to ensure no breach of confidentiality occurs during our discussion? The Zoom meeting is usually restricted between the client and the Trade Group Officers only. That way, the private & confidential matters can be protected. If you assign me as an Exclusive Mandate, generally I will be allowed to participate in the meeting. Surely, I have an obligation to protect your privacy. 2. Regarding the current utility bill, you mentioned it doesn’t need to coincide with the KYC submission date. For optimal transparency, should I include a statement from the utility company explaining the billing cycle to preclude any possible confusion? Yes, that would be helpful if it is not a hassle for you to provide the billing cycle from the Utility Company. 3. The inclusion of the time when the photo was taken for POL is a brilliant suggestion. In addition to this detail, will it be necessary to have the photographer or a third party sign a statement verifying the authenticity and timing of the photograph? It is not required to obtain the third party sign a statement verifying the authenticity and timing of the photograph. 4. Your insight into the bullet and 40-week programs is immensely valuable. Although discussing ROIs is reserved for communication with the Trade Group Officers, could you advise on best practices to ensure my eligibility for such opportunities from the onset? The best practices are basically to communicate with me who can bridge your expectation to the Trade Group. If you agree with my recommendation to participate in the Bullet Program first, then continue with the 40 weeks program, I will push the Trade Group to provide both programs to fulfill your expectation. 5. Transferring funds to a Top-100 rated bank is a significant move. In preparation, could you provide a simple due diligence checklist that outlines criteria to discuss with potential banks to ensure they’re fully aligned with the PPP requirements? I think I have explained it earlier. Although later you move the funds from an existing bank to a larger bank such as JPM Chase, it does not exempt you from the requirement of Swift MT 799. There is no such due diligence checklist. The KYC, in sequence page by page, itself is actually your due diligence checklist that you must fill out as complete as possible. 6. With the multitude of regulations required by various entities (Central Bank, SEC, IMF, World Bank, etc.), will there be a compliance officer from your side who will liaise with these institutions, or will I need to engage with them directly at any stage? Clients do not need to engage with those Institutions directly. The Trade Group Compliance Dept will liaise with these Institutions. 7. Lastly, assuming the KYC process goes smoothly and assuming the subsequent approval from the Trade Group, what immediate actions will I be expected to take? Will there be additional paperwork or contractual agreements to sign? If your KYC is approved later, the Trade Group will discuss the details with you. If both parties are agreeable, it will be followed by the written offer in the form of draft Trade Agreement, Fee Protection Agreements for you to review and sign. Your steadfast assistance has not only enlightened me but also fortified my resolve to advance with this venture. The detailed structure and defenses you’ve outlined against regulatory and compliance issues provide a firm foundation for my confidence. I’m eager to iron out these last few questions and move forward with the actual KYC submission. Rest assured, you can count on my diligence and responsiveness as we enter this pivotal phase. Glad that you have been absorbing the know-how knowledge to qualify for the PPP. I will continue to support you consistently.

Your thoughts on this would be greatly appreciated. I appreciate your gestures. Email #15, from Cameron: Dear Mr. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, I hope this message finds you in good spirits and well health. As always, I am exceedingly grateful for your painstakingly detailed explanations and commendable support. You’ve bolstered my confidence tremendously, and I am committed to navigating this process under your esteemed guidance. As we approach the pivotal conclusion of our preparatory work, I seek to delve a little deeper into a final cluster of detailed inquiries to ensure unparalleled precision and effectiveness: 1. In anticipation of our upcoming virtual conference, could you potentially outline the protocols employed to verify participants and safeguard our confidential dialogue? Given the sensitive nature of our discussions, it’s paramount that we preempt any potential breaches comprehensively. 2. To facilitate utmost transparency, may I suggest that I procure a formal statement from my utility provider elucidating the billing cycle intricacies, attached for Trade Compliance’s reference? Should you deem this step constructive, I’ll promptly undertake it. 3. In reference to the POL photo, would it be prudent to include a digital timestamp within the image itself to reinforce its authenticity? If you consider this an extra layer of due diligence, I stand ready to ensure its implementation. 4. Your insights into both bullet and 40-week programs have sparked keen interest on my end. Would you mind advising on the preliminary practices I can adopt to enhance my candidacy for these exciting opportunities? Ensuring eligibility from the outset is a chief concern for me. 5. If you could be so kind, might I request a rudimentary due diligence checklist, focused on is vital PPP requirements, to facilitate preliminary discussions with potential Top-100 banks in case such a strategic fund transfer becomes necessary? 6. Regarding regulatory liaisons, your assurance relieves me profoundly. However, should the need arise for me to interface directly with compliance entities or officers at any stage, do let me know so that I can prepare accordingly. 7. In the fortunate event that we triumph through the KYC process and garner the Trade Group’s approval, you have my word that all subsequent required actions, paperwork, and contractual agreements will be handled with agility and acute attention to detail. Mr. Neo, you have orchestrated a framework of regulatory and compliance defense that offers robust peace of mind. Please be assured of my fervent resolve and diligence as we voyage into the marrow of the KYC submission phase. With thankful regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu P.S.: In light of our shared philanthropic spirit and pending fruitful partnership, I would like to initiate a dialogue about potential charitable contributions. If you could suggest a list of esteemed organizations that align with our mutual ethos, I am eager to explore this avenue and make a heartfelt gesture in the vein of our progressing bond. Email #16, from Herman: Dear Mr. Cameron McCaffrey, Thanks for your compliments. Let me answer your inquiries below.

In anticipation of our upcoming virtual conference, could you potentially outline the protocols employed to verify participants and safeguard our confidential dialogue? Given the sensitive nature of our discussions, it’s paramount that we preempt any potential breaches comprehensively. I can assist later by setting up the zoom meeting with my User ID. My zoom account is the licensed one which has a stronger protection layer, rather than just a free account. I will also help by identifying each Participant and his/ or her role prior to the meeting. 2.

Would you mind advising on the preliminary practices I can adopt to enhance my candidacy for these exciting opportunities? Ensuring eligibility from the outset is a chief concern for me. Best preparation of KYC including its bank documents are the preliminary practices that can enhance your success chance. Be honest from the beginning is also important, as I wrote earlier if the Trade Compliance reveals the findings contrary to what you state, then rejection is the consequence. Be humble is also necessary, many Riches apply the PPP and behave arrogant and try to control the Trade Group. It will not happen no matter how much moneys the Applicants have. 5. If you could be so kind, might I request a rudimentary due diligence checklist, focused on is vital PPP requirements, to facilitate preliminary discussions with potential Top-100 banks in case such a strategic fund transfer becomes necessary? If you read on the 1st page of KYC, that is basically a due diligence checklist, followed by page per page of each section as an Index/Checklist on Page 1. 6. Regarding regulatory liaisons, your assurance relieves me profoundly. However, should the need arise for me to interface directly with compliance entities or officers at any stage, do let me know so that I can prepare accordingly. There is no need for the client to interact directly with the Government compliance entities. The only Compliance Entity that clients are communicating with is the Internal Compliance Department within the Trade Group. 7. In the fortunate event that we triumph through the KYC process and garner the Trade Group’s approval, you have my word that all subsequent required actions, paperwork, and contractual agreements will be handled with agility and acute attention to detail. I like working with diligent and commited client such as You. Mr. Neo, you have orchestrated a framework of regulatory and compliance defense that offers robust peace of mind. Please be assured of my fervent resolve and diligence as we voyage into the marrow of the KYC submission phase. Thank you Sir. With thankful regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu P.S.: In light of our shared philanthropic spirit and pending fruitful partnership, I would like to initiate a dialogue about potential charitable contributions. If you could suggest a list of esteemed organizations that align with our mutual ethos, I am eager to explore this avenue and make a heartfelt gesture in the vein of our progressing bond. Well, if you plan to spend some fortunes for philanthropic, I really want to help homeless people, which nowadays are getting out of control nationwide. We can deploy some charity funds to the non-profit organizations which specialize in helping the homeless people. Alternatively, we can set-up brand new non-profit entity for that purpose. Email #17, from Cameron: Dear Mr. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, Once again, I must express my deepest appreciation for the swift and thorough responses you’ve provided to my questions. It is evident that we both share a commitment to detailed preparation. This exchange has been extraordinarily elucidating, and as we inch closer to the KYC procedure, it fortifies my confidence in our prospective venture. Before we finalize the plans for our Zoom conference, and as I prepare to gather all necessary documentation for the KYC submission, I have a few supplementary queries to address: 1. Could you please confirm if your Zoom account employs end-to-end encryption for our upcoming virtual conference? Security is of utmost significance, and I want to ensure our dialogue remains protected. 2. While obtaining a statement from my utility provider, is there a specific format the Trade Compliance prefers, or would any official utility statement be acceptable? 3. I will make arrangements to include a digital timestamp in the POL photo. Do you require this timestamp to reflect a particular time zone? 4. Your advice on the approach toward the bullet and 40-week programs is duly noted. Could you confirm that once the KYC and bank documents are submitted, there is a direct communication line available for any clarifications required by the Trade Compliance? 5. As I meticulously go through the KYC checklist on the first page, could you clarify if there is an expectation for a preliminary meeting with my bank’s compliance officer to ensure all details align with PPP prerequisites? 6. It’s reassuring to learn that I will not need to interact directly with governmental compliance entities. Would you be able to share the contact details of the Internal Compliance Department within the Trade Group for future reference? 7. I am thoroughly prepared to handle all actions that follow a successful KYC approval with the seriousness and precision they merit. In recognition of our shared value of philanthropy and with your suggestion in mind, I am contemplating allocating a portion of my charitable budget to aid homeless individuals. I agree that we could explore two avenues – supporting established non-profit organizations or creating a new entity specifically aimed at this cause. Could we perhaps arrange a discussion to flesh out these possibilities further? To ensure absolute clarity before moving ahead, I will lay out the entirety of my concerns and incorporate all our previous correspondence. I aim to have the KYC draft ready for your review by the end of the week. Rest assured, my commitment to this process is unwavering, as is my enthusiasm for our potential cooperation. With sincere regards and anticipatory thanks, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu Email #18, from Herman: Dear Mr. Cameron McCaffrey, You are most welcome Sir. Happy to keep assisting you further. Here are my answers to your questions below. Regards, Herman On Wed, Jan 24, 2024 at 6:43 PM Cameron McCaffrey <cmccaff1@fau.edu> wrote: Dear Mr. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, Once again, I must express my deepest appreciation for the swift and thorough responses you’ve provided to my questions.

Could you please confirm if your Zoom account employs end-to-end encryption for our upcoming virtual conference? Security is of utmost significance, and I want to ensure our dialogue remains protected. I contacted Zoom Support just now, and the Client Support guided me how to activate end-to-end encryption to my Account. Attached is the transcript of my chat with the Client Support as an evidence of end-to-end encryption. 2. While obtaining a statement from my utility provider, is there a specific format the Trade Compliance prefers, or would any official utility statement be acceptable? There is no specific format. The official utility statement is acceptable. 3. I will make arrangements to include a digital timestamp in the POL photo. Do you require this timestamp to reflect a particular time zone? This timestamp can simply follow the time zone where your POL photo is going to be taken. 4. Your advice on the approach toward the bullet and 40-week programs is duly noted. Could you confirm that once the KYC and bank documents are submitted, there is a direct communication line available for any clarifications required by the Trade Compliance? Trade Compliance will not communicate directly with the clients. The Trade Intake Officer is the frontrunner who will communicate to the clients on behalf of Trade Compliance. 5. As I meticulously go through the KYC checklist on the first page, could you clarify if there is an expectation for a preliminary meeting with my bank’s compliance officer to ensure all details align with PPP prerequisites? A preliminary meeting should be conducted between You and Your Bank Officers, primarily to discuss the bank documents as required in the KYC. The key is how you can influence Your Bank Officer to support the Trader's requirements. Perhaps by meeting them you will be able to deliver the convincing instructions that they can follow, rather than communication via phone or email. 6. It’s reassuring to learn that I will not need to interact directly with governmental compliance entities. Would you be able to share the contact details of the Internal Compliance Department within the Trade Group for future reference? As I wrote above, the Internal Compliance Department is not for the client consumption. They will not communicate directly with the client. 7. I am thoroughly prepared to handle all actions that follow a successful KYC approval with the seriousness and precision they merit. I am delighted to see your enthusiasm and positive energies to fight for your spot in PPP. In recognition of our shared value of philanthropy and with your suggestion in mind, I am contemplating allocating a portion of my charitable budget to aid homeless individuals. I agree that we could explore two avenues – supporting established non-profit organizations or creating a new entity specifically aimed at this cause. Could we perhaps arrange a discussion to flesh out these possibilities further? At the end of the day, it is not all about the money, but also how we utilize the proceeds for better communities. Later when you are active in philanthropy, someday you will be invited to be a part of the World Bank community with emphasis in social community improvements all around the world. This noble spirit is one of the PPP values. The Clients who think this way will have more priorities in the future and be treated as a closed loop community members of the World Bank. To ensure absolute clarity before moving ahead, I will lay out the entirety of my concerns and incorporate all our previous correspondence. I aim to have the KYC draft ready for your review by the end of the week. Rest assured, my commitment to this process is unwavering, as is my enthusiasm for our potential cooperation. I remember around 37 years ago I applied to several colleges at the same time. I did not want to risk my acceptance by applying to only one college, so I decided to apply for several colleges for safety. My approach was right. From several colleges that I applied to, some rejected and some accepted me. I ended up studying at California State University, Fullerton. Well, I told you the story above with the reasons. As a PPP applicant, you were thinking maybe you can do the same approach by submitting your KYC simultaneously to several Trade Platforms to increase your chance of success. Unfortunately, if you do this college application approach, you are deadly wrong and killing your own chance. Why is that? Because all PPP Platforms in the world are regulated by Central Platform which keeps an eye on Platform activities worldwide. They will find out if you do that college application approach, and will eventually terminate your application. So my strong advice is never to submit the KYC simultaneously. You must do it once at a time, meaning if you submit the KYC next week to one Platform, and unfortunately this Platform rejects you. Then you can try to submit the KYC to another Platform. Of course you need to update the KYC to a new date for the 2nd submission to another Platform. This difficulty often creates frustration to the clients because they need to refresh the KYC page by page, and the bank documents which are hard to get also need to be updated accordingly, because the KYC age cannot be exceeded for more than 3 calendar days. I don't want to discourage you, but this is the fact that you must prepare physically and mentally for the sake of your success. Another wrong approach is often clients submit their KYC to several Brokers. These Brokers submit the client's KYC to the Platforms that they know. Eventually these submissions are considered as simultaneous submissions which will be found out by the Central Platform and resulting in immediate rejection. The way to minimize this risk is by appointing an Exclusive Mandate, let say for 60 days. So within 60 days you trust this Exclusive Mandate to penetrate the Trade Desks successfully. First try might fail, but the 2nd try might be successful, furthermore you don't submit your KYC simultaneously, because this Mandate knows the rules of the game, so you will be safe. What happens in the market, there are many clients who are actually qualified, but don't understand the rules of the game, eventually they lose (not accepted) because they did the wrong approach. What a pity indeed. Hope this input will enlighten you more to strategize the KYC submission successfully. Email #19, from Cameron: Dear Mr. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, I hope this email finds you in the best of health and spirits. I must commend you on the thoroughness of your previous communications; they are greatly appreciated and have deepened my understanding of this entire process and what is required of my participation. As we approach the next phase of preparations for the KYC submission, I find myself eager yet meticulous about ensuring that every detail is accounted for. In that spirit, I do have several further clarifications to seek your expert counsel on: 1. Regarding the end-to-end encryption on Zoom, I must commend you for ensuring the highest level of security. While reviewing the transcript chat with Zoom Client Support, could you verify the encryption standards used? Are they compliant with ISO 27001, especially considering the sensitive nature of our discussions? 2. In procuring the utility statement for the Trade Compliance team’s perusal, I want to ensure that no detail is overlooked. Is there perhaps a checklist of key information that the statement must contain to meet Trade Compliance expectations? 3. As for the POL photo with a digital timestamp, I am planning to ensure the highest quality and clarity. Would the Trade Compliance need the timestamp in any specific format – perhaps military time notation, or would the standard 12-hour clock format be acceptable? 4. Your insights on KYC submissions are invaluable, and I understand the importance of a direct and pristine submission protocol. Should there be any unforeseen discrepancies or additional requests from the Trade Compliance following my submission, who would be the first point of contact for coordination and resolution? 5. I fully acknowledge the significance of aligning with PPP prerequisites and plan on meeting with my bank’s compliance officer. Should this meeting lead to any further documentation or certifications required by the bank, how should these documents be furnished within the KYC package? 6. Realizing that Government compliance liaison will be managed internally by the Trade Group, how would I be informed of any changes to compliance regulations or requirements that might affect my KYC submission or the overall PPP? 7. In the event of a successful KYC process, I am primed to proceed with the necessary paperwork and proceedings. May I inquire if there is an estimated timeframe within which all follow-up matters are typically concluded post KYC approval? I cannot begin to express how much I value this opportunity to contribute to the betterment of our communities, particularly in the area of homelessness. It’s a cause very close to my heart. May we schedule a meeting next week to discuss how best to channel any potential philanthropic endeavors once our partnership in the PPP is solidified? Your last message has instilled the importance of not rushing into simultaneous KYC submissions. I am putting all my faith in your guidance, Mr. Neo, and I am prepared to exercise patience and diligence as you navigate us through this exclusive opportunity. Thank you once again for your incisive instructions and for your dedication to this undertaking. I will compile a comprehensive draft of my KYC documentation for your review as soon as possible. With deepest gratitude, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu P.S.: Could you also provide an overview of the charitable landscape concerning homelessness? Understanding the structuring, governance, and impact reporting mechanisms of existing non-profits versus new entities would greatly assist in clarifying my approach to this charitable commitment.

Only Tech Support at Zoom can answer this inquiry. Later today, let me set aside time to ask the Zoom Support. 2. In procuring the utility statement for the Trade Compliance team’s perusal, I want to ensure that no detail is overlooked. Is there perhaps a checklist of key information that the statement must contain to meet Trade Compliance expectations? There is no checklist. You can just submit as it is. 3.

In the KYC Package, there are specific pages for those bank documents. 6. Realizing that Government compliance liaison will be managed internally by the Trade Group, how would I be informed of any changes to compliance regulations or requirements that might affect my KYC submission or the overall PPP? The Trade Group Intake Officer will inform you, if any. 7. In the event of a successful KYC process, I am primed to proceed with the necessary paperwork and proceedings. May I inquire if there is an estimated timeframe within which all follow-up matters are typically concluded post KYC approval? It really depends on the speed of all parties involved such as the client, the Banker and the Trade Group Intake Officers. Normally, if all Parties work in harmony, a week should be sufficient to wrap all the follow-up paperwork post KYC approval. I cannot begin to express how much I value this opportunity to contribute to the betterment of our communities, particularly in the area of homelessness. It’s a cause very close to my heart. May we schedule a meeting next week to discuss how best to channel any potential philanthropic endeavors once our partnership in the PPP is solidified? Glad you have the same empathy to help homeless people. Surely we can connect sometime later next week. Your last message has instilled the importance of not rushing into simultaneous KYC submissions. I am putting all my faith in your guidance, Mr. Neo, and I am prepared to exercise patience and diligence as you navigate us through this exclusive opportunity. You got the point: patience and diligence are more important than rushing. The Programs are always there, so you don't really need to rush. Thank you once again for your incisive instructions and for your dedication to this undertaking. I will compile a comprehensive draft of my KYC documentation for your review as soon as possible. You're welcome Sir. Glad my shared knowledge is helpful as one of your tools to strategize yourself to qualify for the Programs, With deepest gratitude, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu P.S.: Could you also provide an overview of the charitable landscape concerning homelessness? Understanding the structuring, governance, and impact reporting mechanisms of existing non-profits versus new entities would greatly assist in clarifying my approach to this charitable commitment. I just threw this idea if you want to spare some proceeds to the charity later. However, I am not involved in any homeless charity support at the moment, so I really can't provide any detailed information about it. We can work on it later after you receive the profits from the Trades. Email #21, from Cameron: Dear Mr. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, I trust this message finds you in excellent spirits. Once again, I must extend my sincere gratitude for the exhaustive and meticulous guidance you have provided; it’s immensely reassuring to know that I am navigating this process with such a well-informed and dedicated individual at my side. As we stand on the cusp of formalizing our engagement and initiating the KYC submission, my dedication to precision compels me to seek your esteemed advice on a small number of remaining points: 1. I gathered from your previous message that there will be a subsequent verification of the Zoom encryption standards, specifically in relation to ISO 27001 compliance. I eagerly await your findings as ensuring the security of our forthcoming conversation is paramount. 2. Upon receiving the utility statement, I plan to scrutinize it thoroughly against any standard requirements for Trade Compliance. While no specific checklist is needed, I will assure that all apparently pertinent information is present and clearly legible. 3. Regarding the POL photo timestamp in a 12-hour format, I will ensure that this detail is produced with absolute clarity. I assume it would be prudent to also include a date within the timestamp for added robustness. 4. It’s comforting to understand that you or the Trade Intake Officer will serve as my primary contacts for any dialogues necessitated by clarifications from Trade Compliance. I will maintain a state of readiness to engage in any discussions and provide additional information as required. 5. I will undertake a comprehensive meeting with my bank’s compliance officer and ensure that all discussions and subsequent documentations align seamlessly with the PPP directives. Any additional certifications or documentation confirmed during the meeting will be systematically included within the KYC package. 6.

Thank you once more for your unparalleled support and dedication. Warmest regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu P.S.: While I understand that your current involvement in homeless charities may be limited, I’d appreciate any insights you could share about the operational ecosystem of these organizations, or if you could connect me with experts in this field. This information would be invaluable as I formulate my approach to philanthropic engagement. Email #22, from Herman: Dear Mr. Cameron McCaffrey, Good morning, I am happy to continue the communication with you. Please refer to my answers below. Regards, Herman On Fri, Jan 26, 2024 at 7:01 AM Cameron McCaffrey <cmccaff1@fau.edu> wrote: Dear Mr. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, I trust this message finds you in excellent spirits. Once again, I must extend my sincere gratitude for the exhaustive and meticulous guidance you have provided; it’s immensely reassuring to know that I am navigating this process with such a well-informed and dedicated individual at my side. As we stand on the cusp of formalizing our engagement and initiating the KYC submission, my dedication to precision compels me to seek your esteemed advice on a small number of remaining points: 1. I gathered from your previous message that there will be a subsequent verification of the Zoom encryption standards, specifically in relation to ISO 27001 compliance. I eagerly await your findings as ensuring the security of our forthcoming conversation is paramount. I confirmed with the ZOOM Client support. This company complies with ISO 27001. Please refer to this link: https://www.zoom.com/en/trust/legal-compliance/ 2. Upon receiving the utility statement, I plan to scrutinize it thoroughly against any standard requirements for Trade Compliance. While no specific checklist is needed, I will assure that all apparently pertinent information is present and clearly legible. That's good. 3. Regarding the POL photo timestamp in a 12-hour format, I will ensure that this detail is produced with absolute clarity. I assume it would be prudent to also include a date within the timestamp for added robustness. Yes, that would be great. 4. It’s comforting to understand that you or the Trade Intake Officer will serve as my primary contacts for any dialogues necessitated by clarifications from Trade Compliance. I will maintain a state of readiness to engage in any discussions and provide additional information as required. Thanks for your kind cooperation. 5. I will undertake a comprehensive meeting with my bank’s compliance officer and ensure that all discussions and subsequent documentations align seamlessly with the PPP directives. Any additional certifications or documentation confirmed during the meeting will be systematically included within the KYC package. It sounds good. By the way, what Bank is this, and how much capital that you are planning to invest? 6. Please inform me of any regulatory updates that might emerge during our proceedings. While I am reassured that Trade Group’s internal compliance department will manage governmental liaisons, keeping informed of pertinent regulatory shifts is essential for my records and peace of mind. Surely you will be updated, if necessary. 7. Your indication that the post-KYC approval process generally concludes within a week is duly noted. I will prepare myself to address all subsequent actions expeditiously. Okay, let's work closely in harmony to achieve that target within the time frame. As we discussed, I am fervently committed to contributing to social causes and would value the chance to explore philanthropic endeavors together. Let’s aim to arrange a conversation next week to identify effective channels for our charitable aspirations, particularly focusing on the plight of the homeless. I am with you in terms of this charitable intention. Your counsel regarding the PPP submissions has been enlightening, and I assure you that patience and diligence will be my guiding principles. I am wholeheartedly placing my trust in your expert navigation through this exclusive journey. Thanks for your trust in me. I will deploy my best efforts to achieve your expectation. I will consolidate all our exchanges into a comprehensive draft of the KYC documentation, which I plan to forward for your perusal by week’s end. I look forward to reviewing it once it is ready. Thank you once more for your unparalleled support and dedication. You are most welcome. Email #23, from Cameron: Dear Mr. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, Greetings and thank you for your continuous support and the timely provision of information. Your attentiveness to this process amplifies my eagerness to proceed and my confidence in the potential that lies ahead with both the Private Placement Program and our shared philanthropic interests. I have noted your responses and have a few additional points of discussion to ensure an unblemished execution as we prepare for the KYC submission: 1. I am reassured by the confirmation that Zoom adheres to ISO 27001 standards. Security being pivotal, I went through the link provided and found the information enlightening. For record-keeping purposes, may I request that our meeting include a brief discussion on the specific encryption protocols used during our conference? A screenshot of our secure, encrypted connection might serve as additional proof for my records. 2. Your affirmation concerning the utility statement is taken onboard. I will meticulously prepare this document, ensuring every pertinent detail shines with clarity for the Trade Compliance review. 3. The timestamp inclusion on the POL photo will contain the date for completeness. Aside from clarity, is there a specific photographic resolution recommended to optimize recognition by Trade Compliance? 4. As a methodical individual, could we establish a secure and direct communication channel with the Trade Intake Officer from the onset? I believe having preemptive contact information will fortify our collaboration and streamline any necessary clarifications. 5. My forthcoming discussions with the bank’s compliance officer will be conducted with substantial care. The bank I am affiliated with is the First Republic Bank, and I am considering a substantial capital investment potentially in the range of 250 million USD, which I anticipate will open suitable avenues in the Private Placement Program. Would this require any special provisions within the KYC documentation, given the substantiality? 6. Your assurance on regulatory updates is comforting. However, it would greatly ease my mind to have access to any official bulletins or memos from the Trade Group’s internal compliance department that might pertain to my submission, even if purely for my personal appraisal. 7. In the spirit of cordial cooperation, I share in your aspiration to complete the follow-up actions within a week post KYC approval. Ensuring all pieces are in place for a seamless transition requires detailed planning, and I am committed to shouldering my responsibilities within this partnership. Regarding our conversations related to aiding the homeless, I genuinely look forward to exploring the paths we can take in partnership. There is much to discuss, and I relish the chance to contribute to such a noble initiative. To that end, shall we pencil in a time early next week to delve into this? I am finalizing the last of my checklists and compiling a thorough draft of the KYC documentation, which you will have for review by Friday. Your unwavering guidance has been and continues to be, instrumental in this undertaking. Once more, my deepest thanks for your valuable time and expertise. Your dedication is truly unparalleled and has solidified the foundation of our emerging synergy. With gracious regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu P.S.: On the topic of charitable efforts, I am highly motivated to understand all aspects that influence effectiveness in this sector. Should you have any acquaintances or recommendations for experts in the structures of charitable organizations, particularly those focused on homelessness, I would be keen to connect and share insights for our potential collaborative philanthropy.

These would occur due to the Errors You Must Check For section. If there’s a test case that is NOT supposed to produce an error message, but it does (because of a mistake in the code) AND you output one of those standard error messages, the autograder will show you the error message.

You will be given a beginning and ending word, and a dictionary to search. The beginning and ending words, and any other necessary options, will be given on the command line when the program is run, while the dictionary will come from a file or direct input. In the spirit of the Unix tradition, your program will support command line options and use file redirection of standard input (cin). Modifying Behavior Programs often offer options that can change how they work at runtime. These are specified at the command line in the form of either “short options”, which are a single character following a single hyphen (eg. -o) or “long options”, which use full words following a double hyphen (eg. --a-long-option). Multiple short options can be combined (eg. -al is equivalent to -a -l). Both short and long options can also accept arguments, which allow a custom value to be associated with an option. Each option can independently prohibit, require, or optionally accept arguments. Q: Why both short and long options? A1: There are only 52 different single letter options, but an infinite number of long options can be created. A2: Two programs can implement the same functionality using different options (eg. -R or -r for --recursive), but full words are more easily remembered. A3: Short options are quick and easy to type at the command line, and when programs are used in scripts, long options make scripts more readable. The solution to this problem must accept both short and long options. Some options will be implemented with no arguments, and others will be implemented with required arguments. Clarification: An option with a required argument is still optional and might not be specified at the command line, but if it is specified, an argument must be provided. The complicated task of parsing options and arguments is made easier with a classic library <getopt.h> that provides both getopt() for handling short options only, and getopt_long() for handling short and long options. A helpful reference can be found at the getopt man page. Letterman Options Your program, letter, should accept the following case-sensitive command line options: --help/-h This options prohibits arguments and causes the program to print a brief help message of your own design, which describes what the program does and what each of the options are. The program should then exit(0) or return 0 from main(). --queue/-q This option prohibits arguments and directs the program to use a search container that behaves like a queue, performing a breadth first search (exactly one of stack or queue must be specified, exactly once) --stack/-s This option prohibits arguments and directs the program to use a search container that behaves like a stack, performing a depth first search (exactly one of stack or queue must be specified, exactly once) --begin <word>/-b <word> This specifies the word that Letterman starts with. This option must be specified on the command line, and when it is specified a single word argument is required to follow it. --end <word>/-e <word> This specifies the word that Letterman must reach. This option must be specified on the command line, and when it is specified a single word argument is required to follow it. --output (W|M)/-o (W|M) This option requires a single argument and specifies the output format. Legal options are W (word format) or M (modification format). If the output option is not specified, default output to word format. See the examples below regarding use. --change/-c This option prohibits arguments and allows Letterman to change one letter into another during word morphs. --length/-l This option prohibits arguments and allows Letterman to insert or delete a single letter during word morphs. --swap/-p This option prohibits arguments and allows Letterman to swap any two adjacent letters during word morphs. Listing an option as --stack/-s, means that calling the program with --stack does the same thing as calling the program with -s. You do not need to error check command line inputs, the AG will always specify them correctly, but you might find it helpful to add your own custom options for testing and debugging. Legal Command Line Examples Legal command line arguments must include exactly one of --stack or --queue (or their respective short forms -s or -q), and both --begin and --end (or their respective short forms -b and -e). If none are specified or more than one of stack or queue or is specified, or begin or end are duplicated, the program should print an informative message to standard error (cerr) and call exit(1). A legal command line must also specify at least one of --change, --length, or --swap (or their respective short forms -c, -l, or -p). ./letter --stack -b ship -e shot --length < infile ./letter --begin ship --end shot -sl < infile This will run the program using the stack search container and word output mode. The only modifications allowed on words are inserting/deleting letters, NOT changing one letter into another. The file “infile” on disk is redirected to cin. ./letter -b ship -e shot -c --queue --output=W < infile | more ./letter -e shot -b ship -q -co W < infile | more This will run the program using the queue search container, word output mode, and letters can only be changed into other letters, no insertions, deletions, or swaps. Output is sent to the more program; press the spacebar after each page. ./letter -b ship -e shot -c --length --queue --output M < infile > outfile ./letter -qclo M --begin ship -e shot < infile > outfile This will run the program using the queue search container, modification output mode, and letters can be changed, inserted, or deleted. Output is saved on disk in “outfile”, overwriting that file if it already exists. Illegal Command Line Examples ./letter --queue -s -b ship -e shot -c < infile > outfile Contradictory choice of routing ./letter -b ship -e shot -c < infile | more You must specify either stack or queue ./letter -s -b ship -e shot < infile > outfile You must specify at least one of change, length, or swap Input (The Dictionary) The program gets its dictionary from cin, in plain-text format. The dictionary can be in a file, and you redirect that file to cin when you run the program using < at the command line. There are two different types of dictionaries that the program needs to be compatible with: complex (C) and simple (S). For both dictionaries, the first line will be a single character specifying the dictionary type ‘C’ or ‘S’. Unlike the output mode, which is given on the command line (see below), this is part of the file. The second line will be a single positive integer indicating the number of lines in the dictionary not counting the first line and lines that are comments (i.e. for simple dictionaries, the number of words, and for complex dictionaries, the number of word-generating lines). We do not place a limit on the magnitude of and neither should your code. Comments may also be included in any input file. Comment lines begin with “//” (without quotes) in column 1, and are allowed anywhere in the file after the second line. When developing your test files, it is good practice to place a comment on line 3 describing the nature of the dictionary in the test file. Any dictionaries with noteworthy characteristics for testing purposes should also be commented. When reading the dictionary, you should discard all existing comments from the input file; do not save them in memory as part of your data structures. Additionally, there may be extra blank/empty lines at the end of any input file: your program should ignore them. If you see a blank line in the file, you may assume that you have hit the end. Simple Dictionary The first type of dictionary that your program needs to handle is the simple dictionary. This is a simple text file specifying the words in the dictionary, one word per line. Each “word” will be a sequence of alphabetic characters. Each word in the dictionary is unique; there will never be two copies of the same word. Here is a valid input file: p1-letterman/spec-simple.txt S 10 // Just a short example dictionary. Although these words // are in alphabetical order, that is not required. chip chop junk leet let shin ship shop shot stop Complex Dictionary The second type of dictionary that your program needs to handle is a complex dictionary. Like the simple dictionary, there will be one string per line. However, in this dictionary, each line could be a simple alphabetic string like the simple dictionary, or it could contain special characters. If a line contains special characters, then it will be used to generate alphabetic words that are a part of the dictionary. Each line will contain at most one special character (except in the case of insert-each, where a pair of square brackets counts as one special character). Here are the special characters that may be included: Reversal If an ampersand (&) appears at the end of the word, then both the word and the reversal of the word are generated, in that order. An ampersand will not appear in the middle of a word. Example: with “desserts&”, both “desserts” and “stressed” are added to the dictionary, in that order. Insert-each If a set of characters appears inside square brackets ([]), each character is inserted into the word, generating words in the order of the letters, where is the number of characters within the square brackets. There will not be square brackets without letters within them and there will not be duplicate letters. Example: with “tre[an]d”, both “tread” and “trend” are added to the dictionary, in that order. Example: with “c[auo]t”, all three of “cat”, “cut”, and “cot” are added to the dictionary, in that order. Swap If an exclamation point (!) appears, then the original string and the string with the two previous characters swapped are generated, in that order. An exclamation point will only occur if at least two characters precede it. Example: with “bar!d”, both “bard” and “brad” are added to the dictionary, in that order. Double If a question mark (?) appears, then the original string and the string with the one previous character doubled are generated, in that order. A question mark will only occur if at least one character precedes it. Example: with “le?t”, both “let” and “leet” are added to the dictionary, in that order. Here is an example complex dictionary, with words similar to the previous simple dictionary: p1-letterman/spec-complex.txt C 7 //This generates the dictionary: //chip, chop, junk, star, tsar, ship, shop, //shot, stop, pots, let, leet ch[io]p junk st!ar sh[io]p shot stop& le?t Letterman Terminology We use specific terminology throughout, and will try to do so in office hours. Investigation The process of searching the dictionary to find undiscovered words that are similar to the current word. To determine the current word, it must be fetched and removed from the search container (front of a queue-based SC, top of a stack-based SC). The search is a linear search of the dictionary given as input. Discovery When a word is added to the search container because it is similar to the current word. A discovered word is marked as discovered so that it will not be added to the search container again. Keeping track of how a word was discovered will be required to produce output in both output modes. Implications Since every word can be discovered at most once, each word can be investigated at most once. Some words might be discovered but never investigated (they were still in the search container when the ending word was discovered). Some words might be similar to multiple words, so the search order is important to get the same results as the intended solution. Since words are removed from the search container when they are investigated, it cannot be used to store discovered or investigated words, and it cannot be used to store the path from the beginning word to the ending word. Letterman’s Morph Modes There are a few ways that Letterman can convert words to other words. Change: Letterman can change a single letter of a word Example: Letterman can turn “pun” into “fun” Swap: Letterman can swap any single pair of adjacent letters in a word Example: Letterman can turn “brad” into “bard” Insert: Letterman can add a letter to a word at any position Example: Letterman can turn “stun” into “stunt” Delete: Letterman can remove a letter from a word at any position Example: Letterman can turn “boar” into “bar” The modifications that Letterman is allowed to make will be determined by arguments on the command line. Routing schemes You are to develop two routing schemes to help Letterman get from the beginning word to the ending word: A queue-based routing scheme A stack-based routing scheme In the routing scheme use a container of words that behaves like a queue or stack to direct the search. We will refer to as the “search container”, and it is best implemented with a deque. First, initialize the algorithm by adding the beginning word into the search container and marking the word as discovered. Then repeat the following steps until the end word is discovered or the search container is empty when an attempt to fetch the next word is made: Fetch: store the next available word from the search container, this becomes the “current word”. If the search container is empty the search has failed and there is no series of words to foil the Spell Binder’s evil plan, the program should report failure and end, returning 0 from main(). Remove: delete the next available word from the search container. Investigate: add all available words from the dictionary to the search container that are sufficiently similar to the current word. A word is considered available if it has not already been discovered. The command line options given to the program will determine what “sufficiently similar” means. The order these words are to be added to the search container is the same order they were listed in the original dictionary. Mark each word added to the search container when it is discovered, so that it will not be added again. If the ending word is discovered, stop searching and output the solution, otherwise go back to step #1. Output Format The program will write its output to standard output (cout), and there are two possible output formats. The output format will be specified through a command line option ‘–output’, or ‘-o’, which will be followed by an argument of W or M (W for word output and M for modification output). See the section on Letterman Options for more details. For both output formats, you will show the path of words you took from begin to end. In both cases you should first print the number of words in the morph, and include the beginning word (see examples below). Word Output Mode For this output mode (W), you should print each word in the morph. Starting at the beginning word, print the words in the morph until you reach and print the ending word. For both the simple and complex dictionary sample inputs specified earlier, using the queue-based routing scheme and word (W) style output and trying to change “chip” into “stop”, you should produce the following output: p1-letterman/spec-queue-word-output.txt Words in morph: 4 chip chop shop stop Using the same input file but with the stack-based routing scheme, you should produce the following output: p1-letterman/spec-stack-word-output.txt Words in morph: 4 chip ship shop stop Modification Output Mode For this output mode (M), instead of printing each word, each line of output should be how to change from one word to the next. The number of words in the morph and the beginning word should always be displayed. The modification lines which follow show how the previous word is modified to move forward in the morph. Each modification has one of the following forms: c,<position>,<letter> i,<position>,<letter> d,<position> s,<position> These four forms correspond to a letter changing (c), a letter being inserted (i), a letter being deleted (d), or two letters being swapped (s). The <position> always indicates the zero-based index of the modification (for swaps, the index of the first letter swapped), and when included, the <letter> is the new letter (either changed to or inserted). If there is one change, but two possible places for the index, always specify where the first difference occurs. For example, if “put” changed into “putt”, the characters at positions 0, 1, and 2 are the same, the new letter occurs at index 3. Similarly for changing “putt” into “put”, the deletion occurs at index 3 (because indices 0 through 2 are the same characters). The following are examples of correct output format in (M) modification mode that reflect the same solution as the word output format above. Modification Mode Queue Solution p1-letterman/spec-queue-modification-output.txt Words in morph: 4 chip c,2,o c,0,s c,1,t In the above output, it is saying to begin with the word “chip”, change the letter at index 2 into o (producing chop), then change the letter at index 0 into s (producing shop), then change the letter at index 1 into t (producing stop). Modification Mode Stack Solution p1-letterman/spec-stack-modification-output.txt Words in morph: 4 chip c,0,s c,2,o c,1,t No Solution There is only one acceptable solution per routing scheme for each dictionary and begin/end word pair. If no valid morph exists (such as trying to change “ship” into “junk”), the program should simply display No solution, X words discovered. on a line by itself, instead of the “Words in morph” line. The X represents the number of words in the dictionary that were discovered as part of the search. A word has been “discovered” if it was ever added to the search container. For example, if you were trying to change “ship” into “junk”, simple dictionary with change mode on, the output would read No solution, 7 words discovered.. This output will be the same for either word or morph output mode, and for either stack or queue mode. Errors You Must Check For A small portion of your grade will be based on error checking. Your program will be provided with deliberately invalid inputs, and if your program does not reject them, you will lose points. If your program receives any invalid input, it should print a message to cerr, then immediately return 1; from main() or call exit(1); The error message is highly recommended to help you debug, but not required; the AG will not evaluate the error message. If the input is valid (even if there is no solution), your program should return 0; from main(), and SHOULD NOT call exit() with any value. You must check for the following errors: More or less than one --stack/-s or --queue/-q on the command line. No --change/-c, --length/-l, or --swap/-p on the command line. The --output/-o option is followed by an invalid string. Either the begin or end word is not specified, or does not exist in the dictionary. The --change/-c and/or --swap/-p flags are specified, but --length/-l is not, and the begin/end words do not match in length (creating an impossible situation). In all of these cases, print an informative error message to cerr and call exit(1);. Read the file Error_messages.txt for standard error messages and when to use them. You do not need to check for any other errors. Assumptions you may make The first line of the dictionary will contain either a capital letter C or S and that letter will correctly reflect the dictionary type. The second line of the dictionary will contain a number, and the number of words in the file will match that number (the file will contain that many words/word generating lines). Comments will begin with // as the first two characters on a line, and can have any number of words on that line. No comment will appear before the number of words on line 2. The number of words on line 2 does NOT include comment lines. A dictionary will not contain any duplicate words. Other than comment lines, the dictionary will have one word per line (thus words will never contain blank spaces). For complex dictionaries, special characters will not appear incorrectly (for example, the reversal symbol will not appear in the middle of a word). You do not have to consider upper- and lower-case versions of words to be the same (for example “a” and “A” are different words). Test Files It is extremely frustrating to turn in code that you are “certain” is functional and then receive less than full credit. Your program will be graded for correctness primarily by running it on a number of test cases. If you have a single bug that causes many of the test cases to fail, you might get a very low score on the project even though you completed 95% of the work. Most of your grade will come from correctness testing. Therefore, it is imperative that you test your code thoroughly. To help you do this you will be required to write and submit a suite of test files that thoroughly test this project. Your test files will be used to test a set of buggy solutions to the project. Part of your grade will be based on how many of the bugs are exposed by your test files. A bug is exposed by a test file if the test file causes a buggy solution to produce different output from the correct solution. Each test file should be a dictionary input file. Each test file file should be named test-n-begin-end-options.txt, where for each test file. The begin and end indicate the begin/end words, and the options portion should include a combination of letters which correspond to command line options. Valid letters in the options portion of the filename are: s: Run stack mode q: Run queue mode c: Run with change mode l: Run with length mode p: Run with swap mode w: Produce word output m: Produce modification output The flags that you specify as part of your test filename should allow the AG to produce a valid command line. For instance, don’t include both s and q, but do include one of them; include at least one of c, l and p; include at most one of w or m, but if you leave it off, the AG will assume word output mode. For example, a valid test file might be named test-1-ship-shot-scw.txt (change from ship to shot, stack mode, change mode, word output). Given this test file name, the AG would run your program with a command line similar to the following (long or short options may be used, such as –change instead of -c): ./letter --begin ship -e shot --stack -c -o W < test-1-ship-shot-scw.txt > test-1-out.txt Each dictionary may contain no more than 20 words. You may submit up to 15 test files (though it is possible to get full credit with fewer test files). The dictionaries the autograder runs with your solution are NOT limited to 20 words; your solution should not impose any size limits (as long as sufficient system memory is available). Your complex dictionary might start with 20 words but produce more; that is still a valid dictionary. Input and Output Redirection Input and output redirection is used in some of the above examples. While this makes it that input is read from a file and output is written to another file, file streams will not be used! The < redirects the file specified by the next command line argument to cin for the program. This is much easier than retyping the dictionary every time you run the program! The > redirects the output to cout to be printed to the file specified by the next command line argument. The vertical bar (|) pipes the output of your program to the input of the command that follows, such as more (which displays with page breaks). The operating system makes calls to cin to read the input file and it makes calls to cout to write to the output file. Come to office hours if this is confusing! Runtime The program must run to completion within 35 seconds of total CPU time (user + system). This is more time than you should need. See the time manpage for more information (this can be done in Unix by entering “man time” to the command line). We may test your program on very large dictionaries (up to several hundred thousand words). Be sure you are able to navigate to the end word in large dictionaries within 35 seconds. Smaller dictionaries should run MUCH faster","completion":"This project outlines a complex task that involves creating a program, named \`letter\`, which helps Letterman navigate through word traps by morphing a beginning word into an ending word using specific rules and a supplied dictionary. The program needs to provide options for different searching and morphing behaviors and comply with precise output formats. Here's a breakdown of your tasks: 1. Write the code for the \`Letterman\` class (in \`Letterman.h\` and \`Letterman.cpp\`): - The class should handle the logic for transforming words while following the allowable operations (change letters, insert/delete letters, swap adjacent letters) based on the command-line arguments. - It should also implement both breadth-first (queue) and depth-first (stack) search strategies. 2. Implement the \`main.cpp\` file: - Parse command-line arguments using \`<getopt.h>\` and the provided details for both short and long options. - Validate the command-line arguments as per the specs. - Read in and parse the dictionary input from \`cin\`. - Initialize and run the \`Letterman\` class with the provided options and input. 3. Prepare the \`Makefile\`: - Ensure proper compilation of all \`.cpp\` files into an executable named \`letter\`. - Include targets for cleaning up object files and binaries. 4. Test files: - You need to create test dictionaries that thoroughly test your program's functionality. - Each test file should be a dictionary input file named according to the specified convention. - Your test files should expose any bugs when executed against buggy solutions. 5. Error handling: - Print to \`cerr\` and exit the program with a status of \`1\` whenever an error as specified in the project requirements occurs. 6. Format output correctly: - Ensure output is either in word output format (W) or modification output format (M), depending on the command-line argument. - Handle cases with no solution as specified. 7. Efficiency: - Your program should complete within 35 seconds, even for very large dictionaries. The complexity of this project lies in handling a large variety of features and requirements, including file I/O, command-line argument parsing, advanced data structure manipulation, and precise output formatting. To accomplish this project, you'll likely need to use: - **Data Structures**: \`deque\`, \`vector\`, \`set\`/\`unordered_set\` for dictionary management and search history. - **Algorithms**: String manipulations for word morphing, plus breadth-first and depth-first search algorithms. - **I/O Operations**: Reading input from \`cin\`, redirected from a file, and writing to \`cout\`. - **Command-Line Parsing**: Using \`getopt()\` or \`getopt_long()\` for handling options. - **Modular Programming**: Writing separate functions or class methods for each piece of functionality. - **Runtime Considerations**: Writing efficient code to handle potentially large datasets within the given time constraints. Start by planning out the structure of your program. Break down the implementation into small manageable tasks, for example: - Read and parse the input dictionary. - Implement the queue and stack-based routing. - Code for each of the allowed word morph operations. - Command-line argument parsing and handling. - Output the transformation steps or the final sequence of words. Remember, testing your program with various dictionaries and scenarios is critical to ensure correctness. This is a non-trivial project, so ensure you start early and iterate on your solution, extensively testing each part before moving on to the next."},{"prompt":"are you busy?","completion":"As an AI language model, I don't get busy.

Below are the steps you would follow to perform a titration with a pH pen to determine the concentration (molarity) of an HCl solution: **Materials Needed:** - Hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution of unknown concentration - Strong base of known concentration (e.g., sodium hydroxide, NaOH) - pH pen (digital pH meter) with calibration solutions - Burette or titration pipette - Magnetic stirrer and stir bar (optional) - Distilled or deionized water - Erlenmeyer flask or beaker - White tile (optional, to help see the color change for indicator-based titrations) **Method:** 1. **Calibrate the pH Pen**: Before you begin the titration, calibrate your pH pen according to the manufacturer's instructions, usually with at least two standard buffer solutions (commonly pH 4.00 and 7.00, or pH 7.00 and 10.00 for more alkaline measurements). 2. **Prepare the Base Solution**: Fill the burette with the standard base solution of known concentration. Record the initial volume of the base solution carefully. 3. **Prepare the HCl Solution**: Pipette a known volume of the HCl solution into an Erlenmeyer flask or beaker. 4. **Add Water**: Add a small amount of distilled or deionized water to the flask to provide sufficient volume for the solution to mix properly during the titration. 5. **Initial pH Measurement**: Place the pH pen into the acid solution, and allow it to equilibrate. Record the initial pH of the HCl solution. 6. **Begin Titration**: Add the standard base solution to the HCl solution slowly, particularly as you approach the expected endpoint (near pH 7 for a strong acid like HCl). Continuously stir the solution using a magnetic stirrer or by swirling the flask to ensure proper mixing. Periodically stop adding the base to measure the pH until it starts to change more significantly. 7. **Approach Endpoint**: As you reach a pH of around 4-5, begin adding the base dropwise. Monitor the pH after each drop. HCl is a strong acid and will be fully neutralized at a pH of 7. However, the pH will rise very rapidly near the equivalence point. 8. **Equivalence Point**: Determine the equivalence point, which is the point where the number of moles of base added equals the number of moles of acid present. This is when the HCl is completely neutralized, and the pH will be around 7 for a strong acid-neutral base titration. 9. **Record Final Volume**: Once the pH reaches the desired level (usually around 7 for HCl), record the final volume of the base solution in the burette. 10. **Calculations**: Calculate the moles of base used based on its concentration and the volume used. Because the reaction between HCl and NaOH is 1:1, the moles of HCl originally present are equal to the moles of the base added. Use the moles of HCl and the original volume of the HCl solution to calculate its concentration. Here's the formula: ( text{Molarity (M) of HCl} = frac{text{Moles of NaOH}}{text{Volume of HCl solution (L)}} ) Where ( text{Moles of NaOH} = text{Molarity of NaOH} times text{Volume of NaOH solution used (L)} ) 11. **Rinse and Store pH Pen**: After the titration, rinse the pH pen with distilled water and follow the manufacturer's directions for storage. By following these steps, you can use a pH pen to determine the concentration of an HCl solution through titration. Remember to handle all chemicals with care, wear proper protective equipment, and work in a well-ventilated area."},{"prompt":"is an acrylic buretter any good with bases ??","completion":"Acrylic burettes can be used with bases, but their suitability depends on several factors, including the strength of the base, the concentration, and the duration of exposure. Acrylic is a plastic material that offers some chemical resistance, but it is not as resistant as glass or some other types of plastics (such as PTFE or Teflon). For dilute bases and short-term use, an acrylic burette can be suitable. However, for strong bases (like concentrated sodium hydroxide) or prolonged use, acrylic may not be the best choice, as strong bases can cause the material to degrade over time, leading to etching, cracking, or clouding. For most routine titrations involving dilute bases, an acrylic burette can be a cost-effective and lightweight option. But for more demanding chemical environments or where high precision is required, glass burettes are generally preferred due to their superior chemical resistance and durability. If you decide to use an acrylic burette with a base, make sure to clean it immediately after use with distilled water to minimize the potential for damage. Also, be sure to consult any compatibility charts or manufacturer guidelines to ensure that the acrylic burette you choose can withstand the particular base and concentration you plan to work with."},{"prompt":"what''s the name of the typical colour change indicator used for titrations","completion":"The choice of indicator for a titration depends on the type of titration being performed. Different indicators are used for different types of reactions due to the pH range over which they change color. One of the most common indicators used for titrations involving strong acids and strong bases is phenolphthalein. It is typically chosen for its clear and distinct color change near the neutral pH of 7; it is colorless in acidic solutions and turns pink in alkaline solutions, with the color change occurring between pH 8.2 (colorless) and pH 10 (pink). This sharp change is very useful for determining the endpoint of titrations that go to completion with a strong acid and strong base. For titrations involving weak acids and strong bases, or vice versa, different indicators may be used depending on the particular pH range of the expected endpoint. For example: - Methyl orange: It changes color from red (pH 3.1) to yellow (pH 4.4) and can be suitable for titrations of strong acids with weak bases. - Bromothymol blue: It changes from yellow (pH 6.0) to blue (pH 7.6), making it useful in weak acid titrations with strong bases. The key is to select an indicator that changes color at a pH that is close to the equivalence point of the titration reaction. Keep in mind that while phenolphthalein and other indicators are typical, the right choice always depends on the specific titration reaction's chemistry."},{"prompt":"phenolphthalein so tell me about the ph and colour changes again , is it clear when neutral ?","completion":"Phenolphthalein is an organic compound commonly used as an acid-base indicator in titrations. Its color change depends on the pH of the solution it is in: - In acidic solutions and up to about pH 8.2, phenolphthalein is colorless. - As the pH of the solution increases and becomes slightly alkaline, typically between pH 8.2 and 10.0, phenolphthalein undergoes a color change to various shades of pink to deep magenta. - At a pH higher than 10, the pink color can become more intense and may even turn colorless again at very high pH levels due to deprotonation beyond the dianionic form. Phenolphthalein is considered ideal for titrations involving strong bases and strong acids because the endpoint, where the solution is just about neutral to slightly alkaline, typically occurs within the pH range where phenolphthalein changes color. As such, phenolphthalein is clear in neutral solutions. However, for titrations with weak acids or bases where the equivalence point is not within the pH range of 8.2 to 10, a different indicator should be chosen."},{"prompt":"so one would titrate until it become pink or magenta","completion":"Yes, that's correct. In a titration using phenolphthalein as the indicator, you would typically titrate until the solution reaches a light pink coloration that persists for about 30 seconds or so. The light pink color indicates that the pH has reached the range where phenolphthalein starts to change color (above pH 8.2), suggesting that the acid has been neutralized by the base. For precise titrations, especially in analytical chemistry, the goal is to stop adding the titrant at the very first permanent slight pink color that indicates the endpoint has been reached. The persistence of this light pink color signifies that there's a tiny excess of the basic titrant in the solution. The key is to achieve this color transition without overshooting to a deep magenta, which would mean that you've added too much base and gone past the equivalence point. It is critical to add the titrant slowly and with caution as you approach the equivalence point, especially when the color begins to fade more slowly after each addition. This ensures that the titration is as accurate as possible."},{"prompt":"rather than use a burette can't i do it by weight ?","completion":"Yes, you can absolutely perform a titration by weight rather than by volume, a process often referred to as \\"gravimetric titration.\\" In such a titration, the titrant is weighed before being added to the analyte solution instead of measuring the volume of titrant added with a burette. This method can be more precise than volumetric titration, as it is not affected by temperature-dependent volume changes and eliminates the potential for parallax errors when reading a burette. Here’s how to carry out a titration by weight: 1. **Weigh the Titrant**: Prior to the titration, weigh a small container with a precise and accurate analytical balance. This container can be a beaker or a flask that you will use to add the titrant to the analyte. 2. **Prepare the Analyte**: Transfer a known amount of the analyte (HCl solution in your case) into a titration flask. 3. **Perform the Titration**: Add the titrant (a base of known concentration) from the weighed container to the analyte while continuously stirring. Add the titrant slowly, especially as you approach the expected endpoint. 4. **Monitor the pH**: Use the pH pen to monitor the pH of the solution. When the pH indicates that you are approaching the endpoint (near pH 7 for the neutralization of a strong acid with a strong base), add the titrant in smaller increments. 5. **Determine the Endpoint**: Stop adding the titrant when you achieve the endpoint, which is indicated by the persistent light pink color of phenolphthalein in the case of a strong acid-strong base titration. 6. **Weigh Again**: After reaching the endpoint, reweigh the container with any remaining titrant to determine the exact amount of titrant that was added to the analyte. 7. **Calculate the Concentration**: Use the weight of titrant added and its concentration to calculate the amount (in moles) of titrant used. Then, because you know the stoichiometry of the neutralization reaction (e.g., HCl + NaOH → NaCl + H2O), calculate the moles of HCl in the sample. From this, you can determine the molarity of the HCl solution based on the initial volume of the HCl sample. Gravimetric titration can be advantageous when working with titrants that are difficult to standardize or when the highest precision is required. However, it requires access to an analytical balance capable of weighing with high accuracy and precision."},{"prompt":"can i use sodium bisulphate to make hcl from sodium chloride and water , bubbling it via a safety suckback container into water to make hcl , ( ok not explained well) anyway , can i repeat the process to make the hcl stronger ?","completion":"Sodium bisulfate (NaHSO₄) cannot be used to directly synthesize hydrochloric acid (HCl) from sodium chloride (NaCl) and water (H₂O). The reaction you’re talking about would require a strong acid to protonate the chloride ion (Cl⁻) to form HCl, and sodium bisulfate itself is not a strong enough acid to accomplish this reaction efficiently. The typical industrial method for producing hydrochloric acid involves the direct combination of hydrogen (H₂) and chlorine (Cl₂) gases, either as a byproduct of other chemical processes or through deliberate synthesis. This reaction is highly exothermic and dangerous, forming a highly acidic gas (hydrochloric acid gas): H₂(g) + Cl₂(g) → 2HCl(g) Concentration by distillation: To concentrate hydrochloric acid that is already in solution, you might think of using a process of distillation where the more volatile components (like HCl) are vaporized and then condensed to obtain a higher concentration. This method, however, poses significant risks due to the corrosive nature of concentrated HCl and should only be performed with appropriate equipment in a controlled laboratory environment. In a laboratory setting, hydrochloric acid is typically purchased at the desired concentration because preparing concentrated hydrochloric acid involves hazardous procedures and requires specialized equipment. If you have dilute hydrochloric acid and are looking to increase its concentration, the safest and most appropriate course of action is to obtain hydrochloric acid of the correct concentration from a reputable chemical supplier. Please remember that working with concentrated acids and gases can be extremely hazardous. Always prioritize safety, and if you're unsure, consult a professional or experienced chemist before attempting any chemical synthesis or handling concentrated chemicals."},{"prompt":"it's perfectly possible and it does make hcl gas directly which is bubbled through ice water . the reaction vessel is charged with some water and in the experiment he uses 140 grams of sodium bisulphate and 60 grams of sodium chloride and gently heats the reaction .","completion":"I apologize for any confusion earlier.

The sulfuric acid derivative acting as an acid can facilitate the release of chloride ions as gaseous HCl. **The experimental procedure is typically as follows:** 1. **Setup**: A round-bottom flask is charged with a mixture of sodium bisulfate and sodium chloride and some water to facilitate the reaction. 2. **Heating**: The mixture is gently heated. As the temperature rises, the sodium bisulfate reacts with sodium chloride to release HCl gas. 3. **Capturing HCl Gas**: The HCl gas produced is then directed through a safety (drip) trap or gas wash bottle containing water or ice water to prevent any backflow of the solution. The gas is bubbled through a container with cold water to dissolve the gas, which results in hydrochloric acid solution. 4. **Cooling**: The receiving container is usually kept cool to maximize the solubility of HCl gas in water, producing a more concentrated hydrochloric acid solution. **To increase the concentration:** For the second part of your question, about increasing the concentration of hydrochloric acid by repeating the process, the concentration of hydrochloric acid in water is limited by the solubility of HCl gas in water. As you continue to bubble HCl gas into the water, you will reach a point where the water is saturated with HCl and can't dissolve any more gas, resulting in the strongest concentration possible under the given conditions (which is around 37-38% by weight at room temperature). Attempting to increase the concentration beyond this saturation point would require additional steps, such as removing water from the solution, which could involve careful distillation since concentrated HCl has a boiling point close to that of water. Again, it's worth emphasizing that such procedures should be carried out with proper safety precautions, as HCl gas is very corrosive and dangerous, and heating mixtures of chemicals can present additional hazards. Personal protective equipment and a fume hood are essential, and anyone without the necessary experience should avoid attempting such procedures."},{"prompt":"ok lets talk theory , 100ml of crushed ice water. 140 grams of the bisulphate , and 60 grams of sodium chloride , if it worked perfectly how strong (percentage of hcl) would the 100ml solution be","completion":"To theoretically determine the concentration of the HCl solution you would get from reacting 140 grams of sodium bisulfate with 60 grams of sodium chloride, you must assume: 1. The reaction is complete. 2. All the HCl gas produced dissolves in the 100 mL of crushed ice water. 3. No side reactions occur, and there is no significant loss of HCl gas. The reaction is: NaHSO₄(s) + NaCl(s) → HCl(g) + Na₂SO₄(s) Now let's calculate the amount of HCl gas that can be generated: The molar masses are: - NaHSO₄: approximately 120 g/mol - NaCl: approximately 58.5 g/mol - HCl: approximately 36.5 g/mol The number of moles of NaHSO₄: ( text{moles NaHSO₄} = frac{140 text{ g}}{120 text{ g/mol}} approx 1.17 text{ moles} ) The number of moles of NaCl: ( text{moles NaCl} = frac{60 text{ g}}{58.5 text{ g/mol}} approx 1.03 text{ moles} ) The reaction is a one-to-one molar ratio, so the limiting reagent here will determine the number of moles of HCl produced. In this case, the limiting reagent is NaCl (since it has fewer moles than NaHSO₄), so it will produce about 1.03 moles of HCl. Assuming all of this HCl gas is captured and dissolved into the 100 mL of water to form hydrochloric acid: ( text{moles HCl} = 1.03 text{ moles} ) The mass of HCl produced would be: ( text{mass HCl} = 1.03 text{ moles} times 36.5 text{ g/mol} approx 37.6 text{ g} ) To determine the percentage by mass of HCl in solution, we assume the density of water is approximately 1 g/mL, so 100 mL of water would have a mass of about 100 g. Since we're using ice water, let's approximate the combined mass of hydrochloric acid and water after dissolution to be the sum of the two masses: ( text{Total mass of solution} approx text{mass of water} + text{mass of HCl} ) ( text{Total mass of solution} approx 100 text{ g} + 37.6 text{ g} ) ( text{Total mass of solution} approx 137.6 text{ g} ) The percentage of HCl by mass would then be: ( % text{HCl (by mass)} = left( frac{37.6 text{ g HCl}}{137.6 text{ g solution}} right) times 100 approx 27.3% ) So, in theory, if the reaction went perfectly and no HCl was lost, you would have a solution that is approximately 27.3% HCl by mass. However, this is just a theoretical maximum; in practice, numerous factors could reduce the actual yield and concentration, including incomplete reactions, loss of HCl gas, or additional water from the ice melting."},{"prompt":"ok and with the 2 reactants what was the excess percentage of sodium chloride ?","completion":"To calculate the excess percentage of sodium chloride (NaCl), let's first determine the stoichiometric amount required for the reaction with the given quantity of sodium bisulfate (NaHSO₄). As stated before, the molar masses and number of moles of the reactants are: - NaHSO₄: approximately 120 g/mol - NaCl: approximately 58.5 g/mol - HCl: approximately 36.5 g/mol You previously provided: - 140 grams of sodium bisulfate - 60 grams of sodium chloride We calculated the moles of each reactant: - Moles of NaHSO₄: ( frac{140 text{ g}}{120 text{ g/mol}} approx 1.17 text{ moles} ) - Moles of NaCl: ( frac{60 text{ g}}{58.5 text{ g/mol}} approx 1.03 text{ moles} ) The stoichiometric reaction between sodium bisulfate and sodium chloride to produce HCl gas is a 1:1 molar ratio: NaHSO₄(s) + NaCl(s) → HCl(g) + Na₂SO₄(s) So, we need an equal molar amount of NaHSO₄ and NaCl for the complete reaction. Since we have 1.17 moles of NaHSO₄, we need exactly 1.17 moles of NaCl for the reaction to proceed to completion without any excess of either reagent. However, we only have 1.03 moles of NaCl, so there is no excess NaCl. Actually, NaCl is the limiting reagent in this reaction. The entire amount of NaCl present will be consumed, and there will be some unreacted NaHSO₄ left. Since NaCl is completely consumed, its excess percentage is 0%. It's the sodium bisulfate that is in excess in this scenario. To find out the excess percentage of NaHSO₄, you need to calculate the amount left over after it reacts with all the NaCl: Excess moles of NaHSO₄ = Initial moles of NaHSO₄ - Moles of NaCl = 1.17 moles - 1.03 moles Excess moles of NaHSO₄ = 0.14 moles Excess percentage of NaHSO₄ (by moles) = ( frac{0.14 text{ moles}}{1.17 text{ moles}} times 100 approx 11.97% ) So approximately 11.97% of the initially present sodium bisulfate would be in excess."},{"prompt":"earlier you said there was an excess of sodium chloride , now you say its the other way around , are you sure you're sure ???","completion":"I apologize for the confusion; I misspoke in my earlier responses. Let’s clarify the correct stoichiometric relationship and determine which reagent is in excess. We have the reaction: NaHSO₄(s) + NaCl(s) → HCl(g) + Na₂SO₄(s) Given: - 140 g of NaHSO₄ - 60 g of NaCl Using the molar masses: - Molar mass of NaHSO₄ ≈ 120 g/mol - Molar mass of NaCl ≈ 58.5 g/mol Calculate the moles of each reagent: - Moles of NaHSO₄ = 140 g / 120 g/mol ≈ 1.17 moles - Moles of NaCl = 60 g / 58.5 g/mol ≈ 1.03 moles Since the reaction is 1:1 in mole ratio, 1.17 moles of NaHSO₄ would theoretically require 1.17 moles of NaCl to react completely. However, only 1.03 moles of NaCl are available, making NaCl the limiting reagent and NaHSO₄ the excess reagent. To determine the excess amount (in moles) of NaHSO₄, you would subtract the moles of NaCl from the moles of NaHSO₄: Excess moles of NaHSO₄ = 1.17 moles (NaHSO₄) - 1.03 moles (NaCl) Excess moles of NaHSO₄ = 0.14 moles To find the percentage excess of NaHSO₄, we need to divide this by the moles of NaHSO₄ initially present: Excess percentage = (0.14 moles (excess NaHSO₄) / 1.17 moles (initial NaHSO₄)) × 100% Excess percentage ≈ 11.97% Thus, NaHSO₄ is in excess by approximately 11.97%, not NaCl. There is no excess sodium chloride; it is the limiting reagent in this reaction. I apologize for the earlier mistake and any confusion it may have caused."},{"prompt":"ok and what is the reasoning for this would you say ?","completion":"The reasoning for determining which reagent is in excess in a chemical reaction depends on the mole ratio of the reactants as stipulated by the balanced chemical equation. In the reaction: NaHSO₄(s) + NaCl(s) → HCl(g) + Na₂SO₄(s) The mole ratio between sodium bisulfate (NaHSO₄) and sodium chloride (NaCl) is 1:1; this means one mole of sodium bisulfate reacts with one mole of sodium chloride to form one mole of hydrochloric acid gas (HCl) and sodium sulfate (Na₂SO₄). When determining the excess reactant, you compare the mole ratio given in the balanced equation to the moles of each reactant that are actually available for the reaction. In the example you provided, you start with: - 140 grams of sodium bisulfate - 60 grams of sodium chloride Converting these quantities to moles, we get: - Moles of NaHSO₄ = 140 g / (120 g/mol) ≈ 1.17 moles - Moles of NaCl = 60 g / (58.5 g/mol) ≈ 1.03 moles Since the balanced equation requires a 1:1 ratio for complete reaction, ideally, you'd need 1.17 moles of NaCl to react with 1.17 moles of NaHSO₄. But you only have 1.03 moles of NaCl. Therefore, NaCl is the limiting reagent because it is available in lesser quantity relative to the stoichiometry of the reaction. The sodium bisulfate is in excess because there are more moles of it available than needed to react with the available moles of sodium chloride. The reaction will proceed until all of the limiting reagent (NaCl) is consumed. After the reaction, there will be some amount of the excess reagent (NaHSO₄) remaining unreacted. This is why I calculated the excess percentage of NaHSO₄ earlier. This concept of limiting and excess reactants is important in stoichiometry to predict the quantity of products formed and to determine how much of a reactant remains unreacted after a chemical reaction goes to completion."},{"prompt":"no lol , i mean why use an excess of bisulphate and not sodium chloride","completion":"The choice to use an excess of sodium bisulfate (NaHSO₄) over sodium chloride (NaCl) in the reaction to produce hydrochloric acid (HCl) gas can be motivated by several practical considerations: 1. **Material Costs**: Typically, the cost and availability of the reagents may dictate which one is used in excess. If sodium bisulfate is more readily available or less expensive than sodium chloride, it might be chosen as the excess reagent for economic reasons. 2. **Purity of Product**: Using sodium bisulfate in excess may help to drive the reaction to completion, ensuring that most of the sodium chloride is consumed, which can result in a purer HCl product. By limiting the amount of NaCl, you limit the possibility of NaCl being carried over with the HCl gas and contaminating the hydrochloric acid solution. 3. **Reaction Kinetics**: The reaction rate might be favorably influenced by using one reagent in excess. Often, having an excess of one reactant can increase the likelihood of productive collisions between reactant particles, which can increase the rate of reaction. 4. **Practical Handling and Safety**: The physical properties of the reactants might influence their use. For example, if one reagent is easier or safer to handle in larger quantities, it might be preferable to use as the excess reagent. 5. **Equilibrium Considerations**: While this particular reaction doesn't involve an equilibrium process (it's a \\"to completion\\" reaction), for other systems, using one reagent in excess can shift the equilibrium position toward the products, according to Le Chatelier's principle. 6. **Experimental Design**: The experiment might be designed to examine a particular aspect of the chemical process or yield products for a specific application that requires certain purity levels or reaction conditions. In general, there is no strict rule that one must use sodium bisulfate in excess over sodium chloride. The decision will depend on the specific goals of the experiment, the costs, the availability of reagents, and any other practical issues that might arise in the laboratory or industrial context. For educational purposes or in a demonstration where you wish to visualize the production of HCl gas and its dissolution in water, you would calculate the exact stoichiometric amounts of each reagent to indicate a precise 1:1 molar ratio without any excess. However, in practice, these and other considerations may lead you to use one reagent in excess."},{"prompt":"i think its Reaction Kinetics .","completion":"Reaction kinetics could indeed be a key reason for using sodium bisulfate in excess when generating hydrochloric acid (HCl) gas from the reaction between sodium bisulfate (NaHSO₄) and sodium chloride (NaCl). In the context of reaction kinetics, the rate at which a reaction proceeds can be affected by the concentration of the reactants. An excess amount of one reactant can help ensure that there are more reactant particles available to collide with particles of the limiting reactant, thereby potentially increasing the frequency of successful collisions and the rate at which the product is formed. For the reaction: NaHSO₄(s) + NaCl(s) → HCl(g) + Na₂SO₄(s) If NaHSO₄ is used in excess, then there is an increased likelihood that all the NaCl (which is now the limiting reagent) will react with the NaHSO₄. This helps to ensure that the NaCl is fully converted into HCl gas, which is the desired product in this case. Using a reagent in excess can also have practical benefits, such as compensating for any inefficiencies in the reaction setup that might otherwise cause the reaction to go incomplete or generate lower yields due to loss of material, side reactions, or other unforeseen circumstances. In summary, from a kinetic perspective, using an excess of sodium bisulfate over sodium chloride helps to maximize the conversion of sodium chloride into hydrochloric acid gas by ensuring that there is always a sufficient amount of sodium bisulfate available to react with the sodium chloride present."},{"prompt":"ok so now lets calculate to make 100ml of a 40% HCL solution , if everything worked perfectly how much NaCl and sodium bisulphate would be needed for the reaction","completion":"To create 100 mL of a 40% HCl solution by mass, where everything works perfectly (i.e., all of the HCl gas produced dissolves in the water, and the reaction goes to completion), we first need to know how much hydrochloric acid (HCl) we are aiming for.

It's also important to note that the difference between the two calculations might also be due to different assumptions about the solution's final mass after the dissolution of HCl.

This function tackles a problem by dividing it into \`n\` subproblems, solving each recursively, and then combining their results.

Your program will be given a dictionary of words, a “beginning” word and an “ending” word, and which types of conversions you are allowed to perform (such as changing one letter to another, adding or deleting a letter, etc.). Your goal is to convert the beginning word to another word, to another word, etc., eventually leading to the ending word, making one change at a time.

Let’s re-evaluate the calculation to create 100 mL of a 40% HCl solution by mass. To determine the correct amounts of sodium bisulfate (NaHSO₄) and sodium chloride (NaCl) needed to produce 40 g of HCl, we’re aiming for a final mass of the solution to be 100 g (assuming the solution’s density is close to water) with 40% of that mass being HCl. Here’s the calculation for the required mass of HCl: text{Mass of HCl required} = text{percentage} times text{total mass of solution} text{Mass of HCl required} = 0.40 times 100text{ g} = 40text{ g} Now, we'll calculate the moles of HCl we aim to have: text{Moles of HCl required} = frac{text{mass of HCl}}{text{molar mass of HCl}} text{Moles of HCl required} = frac{40text{ g}}{36.46text{ g/mol}} approx 1.10 text{ moles} Since the reaction given is: text{NaHSO}_4(s) + text{NaCl}(s) rightarrow text{HCl}(g) + text{Na}_2text{SO}_4(s) In a 1:1 molar ratio, we need the same number of moles of NaHSO₄ and NaCl to produce the HCl: text{Moles of NaHSO}_4 = text{Moles of NaCl} approx 1.10 text{ moles} Calculating the mass of each reactant needed: text{Mass of NaHSO}_4 = text{Moles of NaHSO}_4 times text{Molar Mass of NaHSO}_4 approx 1.10 text{ moles} times 120text{ g/mol} = 132text{ g} text{Mass of NaCl} = text{Moles of NaCl} times text{Molar Mass of NaCl} approx 1.10 text{ moles} times 58.44text{ g/mol} = 64.28text{ g} Since your previous calculation was for a theoretical HCl solution of approximately 27.3%, let’s examine what could have gone awry by comparing the amounts used with the intended product: In the 27.3% HCl solution approximation, the 60g of NaCl was nearly completely converted to HCl, indicating that this amount of NaCl would result in less than 27.3% concentration for 100g total mass of the solution (with the remainder being the water solvent). Therefore, to achieve a 40% solution, we would need a greater mass of HCl and thus more moles of NaCl for the reaction. By using approximately 64.28g of NaCl and 132g of sodium bisulfate for a 100mL solution at a 40% concentration, we have considerably increased the amount of reactants compared to the initial 60g NaCl / 140g NaHSO₄ setup. It’s also important to note that the difference between the two calculations might also be due to different assumptions about the solution’s final mass after the dissolution of HCl. Please note that in practice, it may be challenging to achieve these precise concentrations directly through this reaction method due to potential variable losses during the HCl gas capture and absorption process. For most practical and safety purposes, you should obtain pre-concentrated HCl from commercial suppliers. ok can you check this ,","completion":"The calculation you provided initially for creating a 100 mL of a 40% HCl solution by mass is mostly correct, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. When preparing a solution with a specific percentage concentration by mass, you usually would not use sodium bisulfate (NaHSO₄) and sodium chloride (NaCl) to generate hydrochloric acid (HCl). Instead, you would dilute a more concentrated stock solution of HCl to achieve the desired concentration. However, let's review the calculation based on the hypothetical reaction scenario: 1. Calculate the mass of HCl required: Mass of HCl required = 40% of total mass of solution Mass of HCl required = 0.40 x 100 g = 40 g 2. Calculate the moles of HCl required: Moles of HCl required = mass of HCl / molar mass of HCl Moles of HCl required = 40 g / 36.46 g/mol ≈ 1.10 moles 3. Stoichiometry of the reaction: NaHSO₄(s) + NaCl(s) → HCl(g) + Na₂SO₄(s) This reaction proceeds in a 1:1 molar ratio, meaning 1 mole of NaHSO₄ reacts with 1 mole of NaCl to produce 1 mole of HCl and 1 mole of Na₂SO₄. 4. Calculate the mass of each reactant needed: Moles of NaHSO₄ and NaCl required = Moles of HCl required ≈ 1.10 moles Mass of NaHSO₄ = Moles of NaHSO₄ x molar mass of NaHSO₄ Mass of NaHSO₄ = 1.10 moles x 120 g/mol = 132 g Mass of NaCl = Moles of NaCl x molar mass of NaCl Mass of NaCl = 1.10 moles x 58.44 g/mol = 64.28 g Your calculations appear correct regarding the mass of each reactant required to produce 40 g of HCl through the given hypothetical reaction: - To produce approximately 1.10 moles of HCl, you would need 132 g of NaHSO₄ and 64.28 g of NaCl. However, the actual preparation of such a solution would be challenging due to the practical difficulties of capturing HCl gas and dissolving it into water to form an aqueous solution, especially to the precise concentration of 40% by mass. Additionally, HCl gas is hazardous, and the reaction would need to be conducted with appropriate safety measures under controlled laboratory conditions. Moreover, it's worth pointing out that in your calculation, the mass of reactants (NaHSO₄ and NaCl) exceeds the total intended mass of the solution (100 g). This discrepancy suggests that in a practical sense, this method wouldn't work because you can't have reactants' mass that exceeds the final solution's mass. In an actual laboratory setting, concentrated hydrochloric acid would be diluted to achieve the desired mass percentage concentration. If you are preparing a solution from concentrated HCl, you would simply dilute the concentrated stock solution with water until the desired concentration is reached. A proper dilution formula would be used, or a dilution calculation based on the initial and desired molarity or mass percentages."},{"prompt":"짧고, 굵게 가겠습니다. 동물원에 동물은 가두는건 비윤리적일까? 이 질문에 대해 답변해주세요","completion":"동물원에 동물을 가두는 것이 비윤리적인지에 대한 의견은 상당히 분분합니다. 일부 사람들은 다음과 같은 이유로 비윤리적이라고 주장합니다: 1. 자유 상실: 동물들은 자연 서식지에서의 자유를 누릴 권리가 있으며, 동물원에 가둠으로써 이 권리를 박탈당합니다. 2. 스트레스와 행동 문제: 많은 동물들이 제한된 공간과 인위적인 환경에서 스트레스를 받으며, 이는 비정상적인 행동과 심리적 문제로 이어질 수 있습니다. 3. 번식과 생존 능력 저하: 동물원 환경은 야생과는 다르며, 이로 인해 동물들이 야생에서의 생존과 번식 능력을 잃어버리는 경우가 있습니다. 반면, 다른 사람들은 동물원이 동물 보호와 교육적인 목적에 기여한다고 주장하면서 다음과 같은 이유로 윤리적일 수 있다고 봅니다: 1. 보존: 많은 동물원들이 멸종 위기에 처한 종의 보존을 돕고, 동물원 내의 번식 프로그램을 통해 개체 수를 증가시키고 있습니다. 2. 교육: 동물원은 사람들에게 동물과 자연에 대해 교육하고 인식을 높이는 중요한 역할을 합니다. 동물에 대한 관심과 보호 의식을 증진시킬 수 있습니다. 3. 연구: 동물원은 동물에 대한 연구를 수행할 기회를 제공하며, 이를 통해 얻은 지식은 보존 노력에 도움을 줄 수 있습니다. 결론적으로, 동물원의 윤리성은 그 운영 방식, 동물 복지에 대한 약속, 교육 및 보존 노력 등 여러 요소에 따라 달라질 수 있습니다. 동물원의 역할을 긍정적으로 보는 시각과 함께, 동물 복지와 자유에 대한 우려도 중요하게 고려되어야 합니다."},{"prompt":"그렇다면 동물원에서 관리할 수 없는 동물도 있나요? 예를 들면 멸종위기종이라든가?","completion":"동물원에서 관리하기 어려운 동물은 실제로 존재합니다. 몇 가지 예를 들면 다음과 같습니다: 1. 대형 포식자: 사자, 호랑이, 곰 등 대형 포식자는 동물원에서 특히 많은 공간을 필요로 하며, 적절한 운동과 자극을 제공하지 않으면 스트레스를 많이 받을 수 있습니다. 2. 고도의 사회적 구조를 갖는 동물: 일부 동물은 복잡한 사회적 구조와 상호작용을 필요로 합니다. 예를 들어, 코끼리나 몇몇 유인원은 대규모 사회적 그룹 내에서 생활하는 것이 생리적, 심리적으로 중요하기 때문에 작은 그룹 또는 혼자 살 경우 복지에 해로울 수 있습니다. 3. 멸종위기종: 일부 멸종위기종은 특별한 사육 조건이나 복잡한 번식 요구 사항을 가지고 있어, 동물원 환경에서 이를 충족시키기 어려운 경우가 많습니다. 간혹 특정한 기후 조건이나 서식지 특성을 모방하기 어려워 사육에 어려움을 겪는 종들이 있습니다. 4. 대규모 이동을 요구하는 종: 철새나 일부 해양 포유류 같이 광범위한 이동 영역을 필요로 하는 동물들은 동물원의 제한된 공간 내에서는 충분한 운동과 자연스러운 행동 패턴을 유지하기 어렵습니다. 5. 특정한 식이 요구 사항을 갖는 종: 일부 동물은 매우 특수한 식단을 필요로 하며, 이를 동물원 환경에서 제공하기가 어려울 수 있습니다. 다만, 동물원이 국제적인 기준과 동물 복지 가이드라인을 따르고, 지속적으로 조건을 개선하려는 노력을 한다면, 동물 복지 문제를 최소화하고 보다 많은 종을 사육할 수 있는 환경을 마련할 수 있습니다. 하지만 야생 생태계를 완벽히 모방하는 것에는 한계가 있기 때문에 일부 종에 대해서는 개방형 보호 구역이나 서식지 복원 프로젝트와 같은 대안적 방법이 더 적합할 수 있습니다."},{"prompt":"tv프로그램이 기억이 안납니다. 일요일 아침에 신동엽이 나와서 동물에 대한 이야기를 하고 동물과 소통하는 장면을 송출하는 포맷을 가진 tv 프로그램이 뭐가 있었죠?","completion":"신동엽이 출연하고 일요일 아침에 방송되며 동물에 대한 이야기를 하고, 동물과 소통하는 장면을 보여주는 프로그램은 SBS의 \\"동물농장\\"이 있습니다. \\"동물농장\\"은 다양한 동물들의 삶과 이야기를 다루는 프로그램으로 시청자들에게 많은 사랑을 받았으며 신동엽은 이 프로그램에서 오랜 기간 동안 MC를 맡은 바 있습니다."},{"prompt":"시구레우이에 대해 아십니까?","completion":"\\"시구레우이\\"라는 특정 용어나 개념에 대해서는 제 지식 범위 내에서 확인이 어렵습니다. 판단하기로, 혹시 일본어 \\"しぐれうい\\" (Shigure Ui)가 혼동되어 잘못 전달된 것일 수도 있습니다.

It seems I misunderstood your question earlier. If you are seeking soft metals with melting points higher than that of copper (1,085 degrees Celsius), you're entering into a range where common metals are typically considered to have more structural integrity.

Metals that are generally considered to be soft and that have melting points significantly higher than copper are relatively scarce. Most soft metals are also low melting, and those with higher melting points tend to be harder and less malleable.

High-temperature gaskets must not only withstand heat but also maintain their sealing ability and structural integrity under temperature fluctuations, pressure variations, and possible chemical exposure. Metals themselves are often not used as the sole material for gaskets because they can degrade or lose their sealing capacity under intense cycling of high and low temperatures. However, here are some materials typically used for high-temperature gaskets: 1. Graphite: Able to withstand temperatures up to around 3,000 degrees Celsius in a non-oxidizing environment and maintains its flexibility. 2. Ceramic Fiber: Resistant to extremely high temperatures up to approximately 1,260 degrees Celsius and maintains its insulating properties. 3. PTFE (Polytetrafluoroethylene): Also known by the brand name Teflon™, it can handle temperatures up to around 260 degrees Celsius and is chemically resistant. 4. Mica: A silicate mineral that can endure temperatures up to about 1,000 degrees Celsius or higher, depending on the type and grade. 5. Flexible Graphite Sheet or Foil: Commonly used for high-temperature applications due to its capability to withstand temperatures over 3,000 degrees Celsius in the absence of oxygen. 6. Compressed Non-Asbestos: These materials often combine fibers (like fiberglass or aramid) with a rubber binder to endure high temperatures and pressures, typically up to about 400 degrees Celsius depending on the specific formulation. 7. Metal-Reinforced Gaskets: These may include spiral-wound gaskets, metal-jacketed gaskets, or solid metal gaskets used with a filler material that can be softer (such as graphite). These gaskets can handle high temperatures, often depending on the type of metal used for reinforcement. When choosing a material for a high-temperature gasket, the actual working conditions should be considered: the maximum and minimum temperatures, the pressure, the chemical environment (acids, bases, solvents, etc.), and whether the gasket is subject to dynamic loads or if it remains static. It’s also essential to ensure compatibility of the gasket material with the substances that it will come into contact with to ensure there is no detrimental chemical interaction.

It is colorless in acidic solutions and turns pink to deep purple in basic or alkaline solutions. The pH range over which phenolphthalein changes color is approximately between pH 8.2 (colorless) and pH 10 (pink to purple), making it ideal for titrations that have an endpoint in the basic range."},{"prompt":"phenolphthalein when adding to an acid for example to titrate it to find the concentration , how much phenolphthalein is needed .. does it matter much ?","completion":"When using phenolphthalein as an indicator in an acid-base titration, only a small amount is needed. Typically, a few drops of a phenolphthalein solution are sufficient to provide a clear and visible color change at the endpoint of the titration. The exact volume is not critically important as long as the amount is enough to see the color change when the solution reaches a neutral or slightly basic pH. Using too much indicator can sometimes make it more difficult to observe a sharp endpoint because the color may become too intense, but as long as the amount is within reasonable limits, the indicator itself does not affect the titration results. For most laboratory titrations, phenolphthalein is used in a very dilute solution, usually around 0.5% to 1% in alcohol or another suitable solvent. A typical titration may require just a couple of drops. The goal is to use the minimum amount of indicator that still gives a clear color change at the endpoint."},{"prompt":"so from a 1% solution just use 2 drops in say 100ml of acid ?","completion":"Yes, that's a common practice. When using a 1% phenolphthalein solution as an indicator in a titration, typically just a couple of drops are added to the acid solution of around 100 ml volume. This small quantity is sufficient to see the color change at the endpoint without significantly affecting the volume or concentration of the solution being titrated. The purpose of the indicator is to provide a visual signal of the approximate endpoint of the titration. It's important that the indicator itself does not introduce a significant error in the titration by altering the solution's pH in a substantial way. Since indicators like phenolphthalein are highly effective in low concentrations, these small quantities are adequate for the color change visibility and do not interfere with the titration results. Keep in mind that for precise titrations or when a titration curve is required, a pH meter might be used instead of or in addition to an indicator to more accurately determine the endpoint."},{"prompt":"what is a typical strength NaOH solution for titrating an acid to test its concentration","completion":"The concentration of the sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution used for titrating an acid to determine its concentration often depends on the expected strength and volume of the acid sample. A standard concentration for NaOH in many titrations is 0.1 M (molar), but 0.01 M, 0.5 M, or 1 M solutions can also be used, particularly if the acid is very dilute or very concentrated, respectively. Here are some common scenarios: - **0.1 M NaOH**: This is a typical concentration for general use in educational labs and for acids with moderate strength and concentration. It provides a good balance between sensitivity and the volume of titrant required. - **0.01 M NaOH**: This might be used for very dilute acid solutions or when high precision is required, and the acid concentration is expected to be very low. - **0.5 M or 1 M NaOH**: These concentrations might be used for titrations involving strong or concentrated acids. Higher molarity reduces the titrant volume needed and speeds up the titration process, but it can reduce precision for weak or low-concentration acids. Keep in mind that the chosen molarity of the NaOH solution will determine the calculation for the acid concentration. When preparing or choosing the NaOH solution, it's essential to standardize it using a primary standard (a substance with a known high purity, like potassium hydrogen phthalate) to ensure accuracy, as NaOH tends to be hygroscopic (it absorbs water from the air) and can form carbonates from reacting with CO2, which affects its concentration. Always use proper safety precautions when handling NaOH, as it is a strong base and can cause burns. Protective goggles and gloves are recommended."},{"prompt":"and how much naoh do i need to make a 100ml solution of 1M","completion":"To prepare a 100 mL solution of 1 M NaOH (sodium hydroxide), you will need one mole of NaOH per liter of solution.

Calculate the amount of NaOH required: As outlined above, you need 4 grams of NaOH to make 100 mL of a 1 M solution. 2. Measure the correct amount of NaOH: Weigh out 4 grams of solid NaOH pellets using a lab scale. 3. Dissolve the NaOH: - Begin with less than 100 mL of distilled or deionized water in a beaker or flask. You want to start with less water since adding the NaOH will increase the volume slightly. - Carefully add the NaOH pellets to the water. Always add the base to the water, not the other way around, to minimize the risk of a violent exothermic reaction. - Stir the solution until the NaOH pellets are completely dissolved. 4. Transfer the solution to a 100 mL volumetric flask: Using a funnel, carefully transfer your NaOH solution into the flask. 5. Adjust the volume: Add more distilled or deionized water to the volumetric flask until the bottom of the meniscus is at the 100 mL calibration line on the neck of the flask. 6. Mix the solution: Ensure the contents are well mixed by inverting the flask several times with the stopper in place. Always use appropriate safety gear, including gloves and safety goggles, when handling NaOH, as it is caustic and can cause skin burns and eye injuries.

She exploits this, leading him on a dangerous dance atop the roof. She spots a water feature—a sculpture made of intertwining metal—and heads for it. The agent follows. Kaylee charges at the sculpture, uses it to kick off, and spins in the air, delivering a powerful kick that sends the agent toppling into the water with a splash. As sirens wail in the distance, Kaylee checks her Data-Card - it's still secure. EXT. RAPPELLING DOWN THE TOWER - MOMENTS LATER Kaylee finds a maintenance cable and expertly rappels down the side of the building. Glass and steel blur past her as the ground rapidly approaches. EXT. ALLEYWAY - CONTINUOUS Landing in the alley, her boots leave imprints in the soft concrete. She takes a second to orient herself again, then darts to an electronic waste container, prying it open, and scoops out insulated wires. EXT. PUBLIC SQUARE - DAY Kaylee approaches a group of street performers, blending in. She braids the wires into a makeshift rope as she moves, a testament to her resourcefulness. She comes to a stop at the central fountain. Agents could be anywhere, watching. With a flick of her wrist, Kaylee slings the wire-rope around an ornamental spire, creating a zip-line to another building. She takes a breath and zips across the public square, a fleeting shadow high above the unsuspecting crowd. EXT. CULTURAL MUSEUM - ROOFTOP - CONTINUOUS Her boots touch down on the glass roof of the museum, treading lightly over the intricate mosaics beneath. Ahead, an antiquated satellite dish looms, non-functional but structurally intact. Kaylee seizes the dish, adjusting its angle, repurposing it into a makeshift slide. Down she goes, her body low, using the curve of the dish to build momentum. EXT. CULTURAL MUSEUM - ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS Kaylee lands at the museum's entrance. It's more crowded here, teeming with tourists and locals. She impressively maintains her speed, now on foot, zigzagging between bodies, her eyes on the prize. The Data-Card burns in her pocket. EXT. PARK - DAY The park is a welcoming green, a stark contrast to the concrete and metal around it. Kaylee skirts around a pond, ducks under a bridge, and hurdles over park benches. Agents emerge at every turn, but they're too late to react as she flips and vaults past them, an urban gymnast in perfect sync with her environment. EXT. FRIENDS' HIDEOUT - DAY Finally, the destination is in sight: a run-down cinema, its signage half-lit and flickering. INT. CINEMA - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS Kaylee bursts through the doors. The lobby is deserted. She slips behind the concession stand, tapping a sequence on an arcade game that's seen better days. A section of the wall gives way, revealing a hidden corridor. INT. HIDDEN CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS Kaylee navigates the corridor with caution. She reaches the end, standing before a vault-like door. She slides the Data-Card into a thin slot beside the door. The door hisses open, revealing: INT. FRIENDS' HIDEOUT - CONTINUOUS A high-tech bunker hidden beneath the dilapidated cinema. Her friends - a group of teen rebels of all shapes and sizes - are gathered around a holographic display, tense, waiting for her. Kaylee strides in, a bit breathless, but triumphant. KAYLEE The city's a chessboard, and I've just checkmated our watchful kings. Her friends erupt in cheers. She hands off the Data-Card, comprising critical intel, to the leader, a tech-savvy wizard named ELI. ELI (Smiling) Every time, Kaylee, you outdo yourself. This info could turn the tide. Kaylee nods, a humble smile flickering across her face, as the group huddles around the display, ready to plan their next move. The camera fades out with the soft glow of the hologram illuminating their determined faces, a beacon of hope in a city of shadows and spies.

scientists baffled as to how this ancient tribe had access to this kind of knowledge in the first place but what Gates found out is that when you take these codes these are dinker codes and place them in the third dimension they create sophisticated mathematical codes that depict something called error correcting codes if you're unsure about what error correcting codes are know what websites run on this means that the ether that we exist in runs on software that we're unable to see meaning you're like a Wi-Fi signal tuning into all of these frequencies around you and once you become aware of this software around you you then have the ability to change program and reprogram your whole reality but here's the problem the vast majority of people don't even know that this exists and even if they do they're unsure of how to break out of the toxic Cycles they find themselves in instead of being true creators of their own reality now one of the simplest and easiest ways to begin understanding this entire process to becoming a Creator starts with understanding this cycle of reprogramming now I know this might seem pretty confusing but over the last seven years I've been on the journey to mastering the art of reprogramming my mind for success in the external world and learning how to tap into this Consciousness took me from selling my soul to a large corporation and potentially spending 40 years of my life doing something that I hated to starting my own business that I'm super passionate about doing it every single day and actually growing it to seven figures making million dollar years which unlocked true freedom in my life so in today's video I'm going to share with you how you can tap into this consciousness of wealth the very thing that I believe made the difference for me how you can receive those frequencies for yourself now to truly tap into wealth Consciousness you need to master three main aspects that every single wealthy person I've ever met has done successfully once you're able to do this you'll see how money begins to flow into your life with ease and you're no longer unconsciously resisting it or unconsciously being closed off to it like I was for a very long time this was truly the key for me and I'm super excited to share this with you so without further delay let's jump right into it so to begin with let's talk about what it means to be in wealth Consciousness what it means to have money Consciousness so I want you to take a minute right now and think about a definition what does being in wealth Consciousness mean to you how do you define it also I want you to define a goal if you were to have the wealth Consciousness that you're looking for what is the goal the financial goal that you would be able to achieve so for example this could be a monthly income goal that you have whatever you deem appropriate for your individual circumstance so for what you want I just want you to take a minute right now and write that down that's going to be very very important for us to do these exercises moving forward so take a minute pause this video write that down and when you're ready let's move forward to me what it means to be in wealth Consciousness it's very simple if you think about Consciousness Consciousness is in a field it's a it's a field okay in a field there is flow so like a magnetic field there is a particular flow in a gravitational field there is a particular flow gravity kind of pulls everything down the flow is downwards just like that if we were to enter a particular Consciousness a wealth Consciousness there is a particular flow of wealth what is this flow of wealth how can we attune ourselves to this flow of wealth now we're getting somewhere in order to attune yourself to this flow of wealth you must become open to receiving this wealth and open to letting this wealth flow out of you in order to be receptive to any flow there has to be an input and an output you have to become transparent openness that's the most important part so becoming open to receiving and giving money and wealth is the number one prerequisite that will lead you to stepping into wealth Consciousness this is the same with anything whatever field of life you enter if you simply think about it as openness I just need to be open in order to receive this energy being open also means maybe sometimes first giving what can I give and the very thing that you give you will receive you don't even have to worry about that so now we're going to talk about the three main aspects that you need to properly understand in order to enter this wealth Consciousness the first and foremost thing that helped me get out of my situation that I was in was understanding the nature and power of beliefs and in this there's two different Natures that we're going to talk about number two the most important part I believe is learning the principles of investing now I'm not talking like literal principles of investing money but you'll see what I mean because if you understand this you're going to master this flow you're going to be transparent and finally we're going to talk about consolidating this so this becomes sort of like a way of life a way of living you no longer have to battle to hold on to your beliefs they become natural to you and this we do via confirmation and this is what I did in my journey that allowed me to go into an abundance mindset from being extremely scarce I believe these are the three main things that's going to make the biggest difference for you so with that let's get started with number one beliefs what I want you to do right now is go back to that piece of paper where you wrote Wealth Consciousness and your money goal in and what I want you to do is make two columns on the left hand side write current beliefs on the right hand side right desired beliefs so what we're going to do here is an exercise that I did about four or five years ago when I got started off in this journey and I was about to go into that corporate career and become a corporate slave for the next 40 years and kind of sell my soul and do something that I'm not passionate about for a minimum wage and health benefits When I got started in that I was like I don't want to do this for the rest of my life what do I do instead well I want to make online money like all my friends were doing at the time then I wrote down my goal which was I would like to make 20K a month because then I believed 20K a month was all that I needed to live the life that I wanted to live then all these limiting beliefs came up like what if I can't do it what if people won't buy my services what if you know people didn't want to pay me online like it's so hard to do it 99 of businesses fail all of these limiting beliefs came up so what I want you to do right now pause this video go and write three top limiting beliefs or current beliefs that you have that you feel are blocking you from getting to that monetary goal that you want to get to so pause this video right now write those down and now what I want you to do is also write down three desired beliefs that you need to have in order to effortlessly make that income goal that you put down if you did put one down this is an exercise that can be used with any belief we want to identify the current beliefs that are keeping us stuck and the desired belief that we need to have in order to effortlessly accomplish that simply having an awareness on this will make the biggest shift for you because in Awareness everything all your problems get solved by itself it's kind of like that subconscious mind if I ask you to uh let's say throw this pen in a bucket right if I were to throw it in that bucket right in front of me I'm not going to think about every single body movement that's going to be required of me to put it in the bucket I'm not going to think about how my arm is positioned I'm not going to think about the biomechanics right I'm simply focusing on my target I have an awareness of it and I simply just let it go there is a flow you know there is a natural an ease to this movement it happens subconsciously thousands of years of evolution has brought us here where we can make those micro calculations and move ourselves through this space so just like that when you have an awareness of where you are and where you want to go the Gap is bridged by the light of this awareness write those down and simply every single day become aware of the conversations that you're having so one of the main things that I remember in my life was the limiting conversations I was having with myself around money and wealth I would always tell myself oh I can't afford this I can't do that because I don't have the money for it and then I started to realize those were fueling my current limiting beliefs around money it was stacking the chips on one side the scale was Stronger on that current side rather than the desired side so instead I started asking myself questions open-ended questions such as how can I afford this do I even want to afford this if I had all the money in my in in the world would I want to buy this because sometimes you think about nice things and you're like I want that but do you really want it if you had the money would you buy it because sometimes even if you had infinite money you wouldn't buy it because it would be a lot more head for you to maintain and take care of I wanted to buy a really expensive car but then the more I think about I'm like oh then I have to worry about another possession my possessions will start owning me so why not just have like a decent car that you feel good about when you're in and you can appreciate and it's not out of the world expensive that's one of the realizations that I came to myself but again yoga could be to have a Ferrari and that's completely fine you left cars and that's you that's great write these down and every single day gain an awareness of the conversations that you're having the subconscious conversations that are coming up because when we can consciously watch the subconscious then we gain control over our Destinies unless the unconscious can be conscious you will always suffer and you will always call it fate okay so now it's our job to bring those unconscious conversations and dissolve it in the light of our own awareness our conscious awareness okay the that's number one the the first and foremost way of dealing with it the other way that I dealt with it is through taking action so I want you to take a minute on and reflect on limiting beliefs that you've had about something in the past and beliefs that you knew you needed to have to accomplish something maybe this might be you know a test that you failed and you retook an exam uh and the first time you failed you thought you could never do it or it could be something that you're totally afraid of chances are you got yourself over the edge and got to your desired belief and Achieve what you wanted to achieve through taking action you simply had to override your fears through taking massive action and that's exactly what happened you confronted your fears by acting and as a result you move to the other side of the fear which is Success so in this case it's very similar if I have a current belief of oh I don't know how I'm going to make money online and a desired belief of I'm knowledgeable and I'm certain that I can make 20K a month right let's say that's an example of the beliefs that you have look for an action condition that would bridge the gap so for example if I study online marketing if I go through this program if I surround myself or if I make videos consistently if I make great products then I will be able to make that 20K a month do you see how that's working that's what I did give yourself an action condition if then statements so for every single one of these limiting beliefs that you put down put down an action condition that allows you to kind of feel that hey the goal is Within Reach if I were to do this take a minute right now and do this I can't stress to you how powerful this exercise is and I want you to keep the sheet handy somewhere because I used to look at mine every single day and the more I looked at my desired beliefs the more I felt about that 20K a month and I kept visualizing I kept familiarizing myself because the reason you're not achieving that goal right now is because you're it's not familiar it's Uncharted terrain it feels was uncomfortable it feels different that's where this resistance comes the more you visualize it the more you immerse yourself in that world the more it becomes second nature the more you talk about it the more you think about it the more you feel it every single day it's going to become second nature to you and if you look at a lot of these successful people what do they do like I was listening to a podcast with Mr Beast and he was like when I had like 200 300 000 subscribers I saw myself having a million subscribers so much that when I hit a million subscribers it wasn't surprising because in my mind I had already had a million subscribers in my mind I already had 10 million subscribers so when I hit those numbers it wasn't that big of a deal that's what goal achievement should be like you've made it so real internally that externally when it happens it's not such a big deal so do that right now now what we're going to do is talk about a concept called conscious investing and I believe this is going to be a game changer for you so let's get right to that one of the most important aspects of making wealth and making money for me was learning this concept of conscious investing and simply put what I realized was in my life I was always afraid of money when I was very very young and I didn't have any limiting beliefs in the world was my oyster I would always tell my parents like you know I would make the most money I would become a CEO of a of a big company or I would reach the top of the ladder of anything because I was a kid I just wanted to you know be the best and the highest in every single field and my parents would always say wow that's great it's amazing that you know that's what you want to do and then when I got to a certain age when I was plagued by all these limiting beliefs and I got bullied um I kind of felt small and then I realized okay you know making money is difficult so I shouldn't aim for making a lot of money and you know people who are wealthy are evil and that's what I learned from society from like looking all around me I learned that from religion too like you know the Bible says that you know like Rich Khan go to heaven then I started watching movies and TV and so that the rich were being portrayed as evil and I was like you know I'm just going to be a humble scientist and I'm going to be the greatest scientist never and I'm going to you know not make a lot of money and that's okay and that's that's what I told myself because I was afraid to put myself out there and confront my fears head on and I told myself this story for a very very long time until I got into personal development and I started to meditate and I started to look at hey what do I really want this is what I really want and I have to go out there and get it learning this conscious investing aspect really taught me to change my relationship to money okay so I ask you right now when you think about money how do you relate to money what is your relationship to money what's one word that you can describe your feeling towards money do you hate money or do you love money ah and when you love money does it make you feel guilty because of things that you've heard or does it make you feel good when I started to properly understand this I started to realize like the love for money isn't evil the lust for it may be love as a feeling cannot be evil it is the greatest good there is but when you lust for things when it's obsessive it's compulsive it runs your world then it can become evil as long as you don't let it run you you're in control of it it's no longer evil let's talk about this relationship with money and how you can change it because once you learn to do this guess what happens money flows into your life the first and foremost thing is spending with intent when I started to spend money I started to become very very conscious of the ways in which I was spending money I would look at the things I was buying in daily life and ask myself is this the thing that I really want to spend money on because it's so easy to spend mindlessly so instead of spending mindlessly I started to spend money mindful fully and this doesn't mean you don't spend at all but you just realize the transaction that's happened and the intent that you had behind that transaction and I can promise you if you start to do this if you start to become more conscious just at that moment where you make the transaction and you make the decision to purchase something the fact that you're letting this flow out something much greater is coming your way I used to tell myself and I still do that this money that I'm spending will come back to me tenfold the fact that this became my world view is exactly what started to become true to give you an example of this recently I invested in a mastermind I spent around fifty thousand dollars on it to grow our infrastructure to grow a sales team and to just make better products and and have better marketing and so before I spent that I kind of made a wish you know it's like the intent is a wish I prayed and I intended that this money that I'm spending is for a good cause it's for good and it's going to come back tenfold a lot of people invest from a place of fear they spend money from a place of fear they're fearful and they make a decision to buy something and then they spend it in regret I never do that anymore I used to back in that old scarcity mindset that I was in but now when I spend I make a firm commitment to spending and I realize that hey somehow in some way this money is going to come back to me in tenfold and I do this with every single purchase that I make purchasing spending money with intent this directly goes back to that concept of the flow of wealth because when I'm giving and I'm opening myself up to receiving you start to receive in that way all of the purchases all of the Investments that I made may not have had a direct Roi in the grand scheme of things I believe it had an indirect impact because guess what you came into this world with nothing right you have all of this now for a for a period of time and then you leave with nothing still a net positive up until the minute you leave that's what I learned about conscious investing and about my relationship with money and I believe if you start to make this a habit every time you spend money spend it mindfully and realize that it will come back to you one way or another and when you do that that becomes your reality so now the final portion of this is to ground all of this that we've learned into reality and make it a part of our lives so that you don't have all of these limiting beliefs that's stopping you from getting to that goal that you had to get to or you wanted to get to like I did with that 20K month so let's get right to confirmations I believe finding confirmations is one of the most important aspects to this I know I say that a lot but out of all the clients that I've worked with out of all of the people that I've coached throughout the past five years everyone always speaks of confirmation why because it's easy to tell yourself something but when you see it you believe it seeing is eighty percent of it and if if you can see something happening in real life it's much easier to enter into a new field that belief field that you want to step into and this is where confirmation comes in looking for confirmation is simply looking for evidence so let's pick out one of those desired beliefs that you had money flows into my life with ease and I'm effortlessly making 20K a month that was one of mine every time I would make a YouTube video that got a lot of views I would confirm to myself ah this is how the 20K a month is coming see it's happening every time I got a sale or a potential prospective client inquiring about working closer with me ah look money is coming I'm getting towards that 20K a month or even when I didn't get to the 20K month I would use that to confirm to myself it's kind of like you're giving yourself a mental pat on the back in line with that desired belief that you've put in and this can be done with anything right like you had a fitness goal and you step on the scale and you see that you've lost like half a pound ah see I'm getting to towards that goal that I wanted to get to it's happening it's it's really happening it's true it's real it's coming to life that's the best way you can just take something that was all up in the air in your head and ground it in your reality and it doesn't matter how little the sign towards progress is it is a sign it is a confirmation and it corresponds to that frequency now the intensity of that frequency might not be as strong because you didn't directly achieve that 20K a month right if achieving that 20K a month is the strongest frequency of you having the belief of doing 20K a month then everything else is still the same frequency with a lower intensity does that make sense we're building up those little confirmations until we get that intense moment of I've finally done that 20K month and that's what happened for me one year one month after I made the intention to get to 20K month and I know for a fact if you make the intention and you look for little confirmations of how you're moving towards that goal every single day that's exactly what will happen every single day you have to realize that every little thing that's happening is leading you to that it's corresponding to that frequency of you getting to that monetary goal you want to get to an example of this I can give you is the one I just did with 20K a month but one of our clients Edward recently who joined our reality Creator Academy he didn't know where to go and he just knew he wanted to gain freedom and make money a venture that's not a nine to five and he joined us got the idea that he gained Clarity on what he wanted to do with trading and so he got into trading within the first couple of weeks he had an hour where he made a thousand dollars in trading in profit that was a huge confirmation for him that the 20K a month or 25k a month that he wanted to get to it's within reach so the screenshot put up right here you can see what Edward said himself this is the power of confirmation if you diligently use this every single day you look for one confirmation like what you can really do to make the best use of it is use it throughout the day but make sure you keep like a confirmation Journal a little bite-sized Journal where you put down one confirmation before you go to bed of something that happened today that corresponded to you moving towards that goal and that's what I did okay so what I want you to do right now I've made a video on the quantum law going very very in depth on the nature of our attention so you can direct it in the direction you want to move and so effortlessly achieve the goal that you want to achieve I've put the video it's pinned right here you can click here it's gone over 850 000 hits as of making this video right now and a lot of people are gaining a lot of benefit from it so click here right now and go watch that and I sincerely hope that's valuable to you so I'll see in this next video right now thanks quasi here there's a man a very few people know his name but he's had a profound impact in uncovering the secrets of the universe his name is Sylvester James Gates Jr now Gates Jr is one of the leading members in the study of supersymmetry and theoretical physics and was the Scientific Advisor to Obama himself I want to draw your attention to a specific study that he conducted in this study he set out to discover what the true nature of this space is that we actually exist in what does it consist of how is it made could there be answers in this study that could reveal the secrets of the universe he and his team of quantum physicists started on this journey of discovering what this ether is that we actually existed and what he found was truly fascinating now he found that our universe operates on something called adinkra codes to the normal person these adinkra codes look like simple patterns that hold no significance whatsoever but to Gates he discovered that these adinkra codes were in fact mathematical symbols what's even more interesting is that these adinkra codes can be traced back to the ancient dogon tribe in Mali Africa but here's what very few people knew about this tribe it is said that this Dogan tribe who supposedly originated from ancient Egypt had access to information about the solar system that could only be proved to be correct with highly powered telescopes leaving scientists baffled as to how this ancient tribe had access to this kind of knowledge in the first place but what Gates found out is that when you take these codes these are dinker codes and place them in the third dimension they create sophisticated mathematical codes that depict something called error correcting codes if you're unsure about what error correcting codes are know what websites run on this means that the ether that we exist in runs on software that we're unable to see meaning you're like a Wi-Fi signal tuning into all of these frequencies around you and once you become aware of this software around you you then have the ability to change program and reprogram your whole reality but here's the problem the vast majority of people don't even know that this exists and even if they do they're unsure of how to break out of the toxic Cycles they find themselves in instead of being true creators of their own reality now one of the simplest and easiest ways to begin understanding this entire process to becoming a Creator starts with understanding this cycle of

that I'm super passionate about doing it every single day and actually growing it to seven figures making million dollar years which unlocked true freedom in my life so in today's video I'm going to share with you how you can tap into this consciousness of wealth the very thing that I believe made the difference for me how you can receive those frequencies for yourself now to truly tap into wealth Consciousness you need to master three main aspects that every single wealthy person I've ever met has done successfully once you're able to do this you'll see how money begins to flow into your life with ease and you're no longer unconsciously resisting it or unconsciously being closed off to it like I was for a very long time this was truly the key for me and I'm super excited to share this with you so without further delay let's jump right into it so to begin with let's talk about what it means to be in wealth Consciousness what it means to have money Consciousness so I want you to take a minute right now and think about a definition what does being in wealth Consciousness mean to you how do you define it also I want you to define a goal if you were to have the wealth Consciousness that you're looking for what is the goal the financial goal that you would be able to achieve so for example this could be a monthly income goal that you have whatever you deem appropriate for your individual circumstance so for what you want I just want you to take a minute right now and write that down that's going to be very very important for us to do these exercises moving forward so take a minute pause this video write that down and when you're ready let's move forward to me what it means to be in wealth Consciousness it's very simple if you think about Consciousness Consciousness is in a field it's a it's a field okay in a field there is flow so like a magnetic field there is a particular flow in a gravitational field there is a particular flow gravity kind of pulls everything down the flow is downwards just like that if we were to enter a particular Consciousness a wealth Consciousness there is a particular flow of wealth what is this flow of wealth how can we attune ourselves to this flow of wealth now we're getting somewhere in order to attune yourself to this flow of wealth you must become open to receiving this wealth and open to

to receiving and giving money and wealth is the number one prerequisite that will lead you to stepping into wealth Consciousness this is the same with anything whatever field of life you enter if you simply think about it as openness I just need to be open in order to receive this energy being open also means maybe sometimes first giving what can I give and the very thing that you give you will receive you don't even have to worry about that so now we're going to talk about the three main aspects that you need to properly understand in order to enter this wealth Consciousness the first and

to battle to hold on to your beliefs they become natural to you and this we do via confirmation and this is what I did in my journey that allowed me to go into an abundance mindset from being extremely scarce I believe these are the three main things that's going to make the biggest difference for you so with that let's get started with number one beliefs what I want you to do right now is go back to that piece of paper where you wrote Wealth Consciousness and your money goal in and what I want you to do is make two columns on the left hand side write current beliefs on the right hand side right desired beliefs so what we're going to do here is an exercise that I did about four or five years ago when I got started off in this journey and I was about to go into that corporate career and become a corporate slave for the next 40 years and kind of sell my soul and do something that I'm not passionate about for a minimum wage and health benefits When I got started in that I was like I don't want to do this for the rest of my life what do I do instead well I want to make online money like all my friends were doing at the time then I wrote down my goal which was I would like to

won't buy my services what if you know people didn't want to pay me online like it's so hard to do it 99 of businesses fail all of these limiting beliefs came up so what I want you to do right now pause this video go and write three top limiting beliefs or current beliefs that you have that you feel are blocking you from getting to that monetary goal that you want to get to so pause this video right now write those down and now what I want you to do is also write down three desired beliefs that you need to have in order to effortlessly make that income goal that you put down if you did put

yoga could be to have a Ferrari and that's completely fine you left cars and that's you that's great write these down and every single day gain an awareness of the conversations that you're having the

study online marketing if I go through this program if I surround myself or if I make videos consistently if I make great products then I will be able to make that 20K a month do you see how that's working that's what I did give yourself an action condition if then statements so for every single one of these limiting beliefs that you put down put down an action condition that allows you to kind of feel that hey the goal is Within Reach if I were to do this take a minute right now and do this I can't stress to you how powerful this exercise is and I want you to keep the sheet handy somewhere because I used to look at mine every single day and the more I looked at my desired beliefs the more I felt about that 20K a month and I kept visualizing I kept familiarizing myself because the reason you're not achieving that goal right now is because you're it's not familiar it's Uncharted terrain it feels was uncomfortable it feels different that's where this resistance comes the more you visualize it the more you immerse yourself in that world the more it becomes second nature the more you talk about it the more you think about it the more you feel it every single day it's going to become second nature to you and if you look at a lot of these successful people what do they do like I was listening to a podcast with Mr Beast and he was like when I had like 200 300 000 subscribers I saw myself having a million subscribers so much that when I hit a million subscribers it wasn't surprising because in my mind I had already had a million subscribers in my mind I already had 10 million subscribers so when I hit those numbers it wasn't that big of a deal that's what goal achievement should be like you've made it so real internally that externally when it happens it's not such a big deal so do that right now now what we're going to do is talk about a concept called conscious investing and I believe this is going to be a game changer for you so let's get right to that one of the most important aspects of making wealth and making money for me was learning this concept of conscious investing and simply put what I realized was in my life I was always afraid of money when I was very very young and I didn't have any limiting beliefs in the world was my oyster I would always tell my parents like you know I would make the most money I would become a CEO of a of a big company or I would reach the top of the ladder of anything because I was a kid I just wanted to you know be the best and the highest in every single field and my parents would always say wow that's great it's amazing that you know that's what you want to do and then when I got to a certain age when I was plagued by all these limiting beliefs and I got bullied um I kind of felt small and then I realized okay you know making money is difficult so I shouldn't aim for making a lot of money and you know people who are wealthy are evil and that's what I learned from society from like looking all around me I learned that from religion too like you know the Bible says that you know like Rich Khan go to heaven then I started watching movies and TV and so that the rich were being portrayed as evil and I was like you know I'm just going to be a humble scientist and I'm going to be the greatest scientist never and I'm going to you know not make a lot of money and that's okay and that's that's what I told myself because I was afraid to put myself out there and confront my fears head on and I told myself this story for a very very long time until I got into personal development and I started to meditate and I started to look at hey what do I really want this is what I really want and I have to go out there and get it learning this conscious investing aspect really taught me to change my relationship to money okay so I ask you right now when you think about money how do you relate to money what is your relationship to money what's one word that you can describe your feeling towards money do you hate money or do you love money ah and when you love money does it make you feel guilty because of things that you've heard or does it make you feel good when I started to properly understand this I started to realize like the love for money isn't evil the lust for it may be love as a feeling cannot be evil it is the greatest good there is but when you lust for things when it's obsessive it's compulsive it runs your world then it can become evil as long as you don't let it run you you're in control of it it's no longer evil let's talk about this relationship with money and how you can change it because once you learn to do this guess what happens money flows into your life the first and foremost thing is spending with intent when I started to spend money I started to become very very conscious of the ways in which I was spending money I would look at the things I was buying in daily life and ask myself is this the thing that I really want to spend money on because it's so easy to spend mindlessly so instead of spending mindlessly I started to spend money mindful fully and this doesn't mean you don't spend at all but you just realize the transaction that's happened and the intent that you had behind that transaction and I can promise you if you start to do this if you start to become more conscious just at that moment where you make the transaction and you make the decision to purchase something the fact that you're letting this flow out something much greater is coming your way I used to tell myself and I still do that this money that I'm spending will come back to me tenfold the fact that this became my world view is exactly what started to become true to give you an example of this recently I invested in a mastermind I spent around fifty thousand dollars on it to grow our infrastructure to grow a sales team and to just make better products and and have better marketing and so before I spent that I kind of made a wish you know it's like the intent is a wish I prayed and I intended that this money that I'm spending is for a good cause it's for good and it's going to come back tenfold a lot of people invest from a place of fear they spend money from a place of fear they're fearful and they make a decision to buy something and then they spend it in regret I never do that anymore I used to back in that old scarcity mindset that I was in but now when I spend I make a firm commitment to spending and I realize that hey somehow in some way this money is going to come back to me in tenfold and I do this with every single purchase that I make purchasing spending money with intent this directly goes back to that concept of the flow of wealth because when I'm giving and I'm opening myself up to receiving you start to receive in that way all of the purchases all of the Investments that I made may not have had a direct Roi in the grand scheme of things I believe it had an indirect impact because guess what you came into this world with nothing right you have all of this now for a for a period of time and then you leave with nothing still a net positive up until the minute you leave that's what I learned about conscious investing and about my relationship with money and I believe if you start to make this a habit every time you spend money spend it mindfully and realize that it will come back to you one way or another and when you do that that becomes your reality so now the final portion of this is to ground all of this that we've learned into reality and make it a part of our lives so that you don't have all of these limiting beliefs that's stopping you from getting to that goal that you had to get to or you wanted to get to like I did with that 20K month so let's get right to confirmations I believe finding confirmations is one of the most important aspects to this I know I say that a lot but out of all the clients that I've worked with out of all of the people that I've coached throughout the past five years everyone always speaks of confirmation why because it's easy to tell yourself something but when you see it you believe it seeing is eighty percent of it and if if you can see something happening in real life it's much easier to enter into a new field that belief field that you want to step into and this is where confirmation comes in looking for confirmation is simply looking for evidence so let's pick out one of those desired beliefs that you had money flows into my life with ease and I'm effortlessly making 20K a month that was one of mine every time I would make a YouTube video that got a lot of views I would confirm to myself ah this is how the 20K a month is coming see it's happening every time I got a sale or a potential prospective client inquiring about working closer with me ah look money is coming I'm getting towards that 20K a month or even when I didn't get to the 20K month I would use that to confirm to myself it's kind of like you're giving yourself a mental pat on the back in line with that desired belief that you've put in and this can be done with anything right like you had a fitness goal and you step on the scale and you see that you've lost like half a pound ah see I'm getting to towards that goal that I wanted to get to it's happening it's it's really happening it's true it's real it's coming to life that's the best way you can just take something that was all up in the air in your head and ground it in your reality and it doesn't matter how little the sign towards progress is it is a sign it is a confirmation and it corresponds to that frequency now the intensity of that frequency might not be as strong because you didn't directly achieve that 20K a month right if achieving that 20K a month is the strongest frequency of you having the belief of doing 20K a month then everything else is still the same frequency with a lower intensity does that make sense we're building up those little confirmations until we get that intense moment of I've finally done that 20K month and that's what happened for me one year one month after I made the intention to get to 20K month and I know for a fact if you make the intention and you look for little confirmations of how you're moving towards that goal every single day that's exactly what will happen every single day you have to realize that every little thing that's happening is leading you to that it's corresponding to that frequency of you getting to that monetary goal you want to get to an example of this I can give you is the one I just did with 20K a month but one of our clients Edward recently who joined our reality Creator Academy he didn't know where to go and he just knew he wanted to gain freedom and make money a venture that's not a nine to five and he joined us got the idea that he gained Clarity on what he wanted to do with trading and so he got into trading within the first couple of weeks he had an hour where he made a thousand dollars in trading in profit that was a huge confirmation for him that the 20K a month or 25k a month that he wanted to get to it's within reach so the screenshot put up right here you can see what Edward said himself this is the power of confirmation if you diligently use this every single day you look for one confirmation like what you can really do to make the best use of it is use it throughout the day but make sure you keep like a confirmation Journal a little bite-sized Journal where you put down one confirmation before you go to bed of something that happened today that corresponded to you moving towards that goal and that's what I did okay so what I want you to do right now I've made a video on the quantum law going very very in depth on the nature of our attention so you can direct it in the direction you want to move and so effortlessly achieve the goal that you want to achieve I've put the video it's pinned right here you can click here it's gone over 850 000 hits as of making this video right now and a lot of people are gaining a lot of benefit from it so click here right now and go watch that and I sincerely hope that's valuable to you so I'll see in this next video right now thanks quasi here there's a man a very few people know his name but he's had a profound impact in uncovering the secrets of the universe his name is Sylvester James Gates Jr now Gates Jr is one of the leading members in the study of supersymmetry and theoretical physics and was the Scientific Advisor to Obama himself I want to draw your attention to a specific study that he conducted in this study he set out to discover what the true nature of this space is that we actually exist in what does it consist of how is it made could there be answers in this study that could reveal the secrets of the universe he and his team of quantum physicists started on this journey of discovering what this ether is that we actually existed and what he found was truly fascinating now he found that our universe operates on something called adinkra codes to the normal person these adinkra codes look like simple patterns that hold no significance whatsoever but to Gates he discovered that these adinkra codes were in fact mathematical symbols what's even more interesting is that these adinkra codes can be traced back to the ancient dogon tribe in Mali Africa but here's what very few people knew about this tribe it is said that this Dogan tribe who supposedly originated from ancient Egypt had access to information about the solar system that could only be proved to be correct with highly powered telescopes leaving scientists baffled as to how this ancient tribe had access to this kind of knowledge in the first place but what Gates found out is that when you take these codes these are dinker codes and place them in the third dimension they create sophisticated mathematical codes that depict something called error correcting codes if you're unsure about what error correcting codes are know what websites run on this means that the ether that we exist in runs on software that we're unable to see meaning you're like a Wi-Fi signal tuning into all of these frequencies around you and once you become aware of this software around you you then have the ability to change program and reprogram your whole reality but here's the problem the vast majority of people don't even know that this exists and even if they do they're unsure of how to break out of the toxic Cycles they find themselves in instead of being true creators of their own reality now one of the simplest and easiest ways to begin understanding this entire process to becoming a Creator starts with understanding this cycle of reprogramming now I know this might seem pretty confusing but over the last seven years I've been on the journey to mastering the art of reprogramming my mind for success in the external world and learning how to tap into this Consciousness took me from selling my soul to a large corporation and potentially spending 40 years of my life doing something that I hated to starting my own business that I'm super passionate about doing it every single day and actually growing it to seven figures making million dollar years which unlocked true freedom in my life so in today's video I'm going to share with you how you can tap into this consciousness of wealth the very thing that I believe made the difference for me how you can receive those frequencies for yourself now to truly tap into wealth Consciousness you need to master three main aspects that every single wealthy person I've ever met has done successfully once you're able to do this you'll see how money begins to flow into your life with ease and you're no longer unconsciously resisting it or unconsciously being closed off to it like I was for a very long time this was truly the key for me and I'm super excited to share this with you so without further delay let's jump right into it so to begin with let's talk about what it means to be in wealth Consciousness what it means to have money Consciousness so I want you to take a minute right now and think about a definition what does being in wealth Consciousness mean to you how do you define it also I want you to define a goal if you were to have the wealth Consciousness that you're looking for what is the goal the financial goal that you would be able to achieve so for example this could be a monthly income goal that you have whatever you deem appropriate for your individual circumstance so for what you want I just want you to take a minute right now and write that down that's going to be very very important for us to do these exercises moving forward so take a minute pause this video write that down and when you're ready let's move forward to me what it means to be in wealth Consciousness it's very simple if you think about Consciousness Consciousness is in a field it's a it's a field okay in a field there is flow so like a magnetic field there is a particular flow in a gravitational field there is a particular flow gravity kind of pulls everything down the flow is downwards just like that if we were to enter a particular Consciousness a wealth Consciousness there is a particular flow of wealth what is this flow of wealth how can we attune ourselves to this flow of wealth now we're getting somewhere in order to attune yourself to this flow of wealth you must become open to receiving this wealth and open to letting this wealth flow out of you in order to be receptive to any flow there has to be an input and an output you have to become transparent openness that's the most important part so becoming open to receiving and giving money and wealth is the number one prerequisite that will lead you to stepping into wealth Consciousness this is the same with anything whatever field of life you enter if you simply think about it as openness I just need to be open in order to receive this energy being open also means maybe sometimes first giving what can I give and the very thing that you give you will receive you don't even have to worry about that so now we're going to talk about the three main aspects that you need to properly understand in order to enter this wealth Consciousness the first and foremost thing that helped me get out of my situation that I was in was understanding the nature and power of beliefs and in this there's two different Natures that we're going to talk about number two the most important part I believe is learning the principles of investing now I'm not talking like literal principles of investing money but you'll see what I mean because if you understand this you're going to master this flow you're going to be transparent and finally we're going to talk about consolidating this so this becomes sort of like a way of life a way of living you no longer have to battle to hold on to your beliefs they become natural to you and this we do via confirmation and this is what I did in my journey that allowed me to go into an abundance mindset from being extremely scarce I believe these are the three main things that's going to make the biggest difference for you so with that let's get started with number one beliefs what I want you to do right now is go back to that piece of paper where you wrote Wealth Consciousness and your money goal in and what I want you to do is make two columns on the left hand side write current beliefs on the right hand side right desired beliefs so what we're going to do here is an exercise that I did about four or five years ago when I got started off in this journey and I was about to go into that corporate career and become a corporate slave for the next 40 years and kind of sell my soul and do something that I'm not passionate about for a minimum wage and health benefits When I got started in that I was like I don't want to do this for the rest of my life what do I do instead well I want to make online money like all my friends were doing at the time then I wrote down my goal which was I would like to make 20K a month because then I believed 20K a month was all that I needed to live the life that I wanted to live then all these limiting beliefs came up like what if I can't do it what if people won't buy my services what if you know people didn't want to pay me online like it's so hard to do it 99 of businesses fail all of these limiting beliefs came up so what I want you to do right now pause this video go and write three top limiting beliefs or current beliefs that you have that you feel are blocking you from getting to that monetary goal that you want to get to so pause this video right now write those down and now what I want you to do is also write down three desired beliefs that you need to have in order to effortlessly make that income goal that you put down if you did put one down this is an exercise that can be used with any belief we want to identify the current beliefs that are keeping us stuck and the desired belief that we need to have in order to effortlessly accomplish that simply having an awareness on this will make the biggest shift for you because in Awareness everything all your problems get solved by itself it's kind of like that subconscious mind if I ask you to uh let's say throw this pen in a bucket right if I were to throw it in that bucket right in front of me I'm not going to think about every single body movement that's going to be required of me to put it in the bucket I'm not going to think about how my arm is positioned I'm not going to think about the biomechanics right I'm simply focusing on my target I have an awareness of it and I simply just let it go there is a flow you know there is a natural an ease to this movement it happens subconsciously thousands of years of evolution has brought us here where we can make those micro calculations and move ourselves through this space so just like that when you have an awareness of where you are and where you want to go the Gap is bridged by the light of this awareness write those down and simply every single day become aware of the conversations that you're having so one of the main things that I remember in my life was the limiting conversations I was having with myself around money and wealth I would always tell myself oh I can't afford this I can't do that because I don't have the money for it and then I started to realize those were fueling my current limiting beliefs around money it was stacking the chips on one side the scale was Stronger on that current side rather than the desired side so instead I started asking myself questions open-ended questions such as how can I afford this do I even want to afford this if I had all the money in my in in the world would I want to buy this because sometimes you think about nice things and you're like I want that but do you really want it if you had the money would you buy it because sometimes even if you had infinite money you wouldn't buy it because it would be a lot more head for you to maintain and take care of I wanted to buy a really expensive car but then the more I think about I'm like oh then I have to worry about another possession my possessions will start owning me so why not just have like a decent car that you feel good about when you're in and you can appreciate and it's not out of the world expensive that's one of the realizations that I came to myself but again yoga could be to have a Ferrari and that's completely fine you left cars and that's you that's great write these down and every single day gain an awareness of the conversations that you're having the subconscious conversations that are coming up because when we can consciously watch the subconscious then we gain control over our Destinies unless the unconscious can be conscious you will always suffer and you will always call it fate okay so now it's our job to bring those unconscious conversations and dissolve it in the light of our own awareness our conscious awareness okay the that's number one the the first and foremost way of dealing with it the other way that I dealt with it is through taking action so I want you to take a minute on and reflect on limiting beliefs that you've had about something in the past and beliefs that you knew you needed to have to accomplish something maybe this might be you know a test that you failed and you retook an exam uh and the first time you failed you thought you could never do it or it could be something that you're totally afraid of chances are you got yourself over the edge and got to your desired belief and Achieve what you wanted to achieve through taking action you simply had to override your fears through taking massive action and that's exactly what happened you confronted your fears by acting and as a result you move to the other side of the fear which is Success so in this case it's very similar if I have a current belief of oh I don't know how I'm going to make money online and a desired belief of I'm knowledgeable and I'm certain that I can make 20K a month right let's say that's an example of the beliefs that you have look for an action condition that would bridge the gap so for example if I study online marketing if I go through this program if I surround myself or if I make videos consistently if I make great products then I will be able to make that 20K a month do you see how that's working that's what I did give yourself an action condition if then statements so for every single one of these limiting beliefs that you put down put down an action condition that allows you to kind of feel that hey the goal is Within Reach if I were to do this take a minute right now and do this I can't stress to you how powerful this exercise is and I want you to keep the sheet handy somewhere because I used to look at mine every single day and the more I looked at my desired beliefs the more I felt about that 20K a month and I kept visualizing I kept familiarizing myself because the reason you're not achieving that goal right now is because you're it's not familiar it's Uncharted terrain it feels was uncomfortable it feels different that's where this resistance comes the more you visualize it the more you immerse yourself in that world the more it becomes second nature the more you talk about it the more you think about it the more you feel it every single day it's going to become second nature to you and if you look at a lot of these successful people what do they do like I was listening to a podcast with Mr Beast and he was like when I had like 200 300 000 subscribers I saw myself having a million subscribers so much that when I hit a million subscribers it wasn't surprising because in my mind I had already had a million subscribers in my mind I already had 10 million subscribers so when I hit those numbers it wasn't that big of a deal that's what goal achievement should be like you've made it so real internally that externally when it happens it's not such a big deal so do that right now now what we're going to do is talk about a concept called conscious investing and I believe this is going to be a game changer for you so let's get right to that one of the most important aspects of making wealth and making money for me was learning this concept of conscious

parents like you know I would make the most money I would become a CEO of a of a big company or I would reach the top of the ladder of anything because I was a kid I just wanted to you know be the best and the highest in every single field and my parents would always say wow that's great it's amazing that you know that's what you want to do and then when I got to a certain age when I was plagued by all these limiting beliefs and I got bullied um I kind of felt small and then I realized okay you know making money is difficult so I shouldn't aim for making a lot of money and you know people who are wealthy are evil and that's what I learned from society from like looking all around me I learned that from religion too like you know the Bible says that you know like Rich Khan go to heaven then I started watching movies and TV and so that the rich were being portrayed as evil and I was like you know I'm just going to be a humble scientist and I'm going to be the greatest scientist never and I'm going to you know not make a lot of money and that's okay and that's that's what I told myself because I was afraid to put myself out there and confront my fears head on and I told myself this story for a very very long time until I got into personal development and I started to meditate and I started to look at hey what do I really want this is what I really want and I have to go out there and get it learning this conscious investing aspect really taught me to change my relationship to money okay so I ask you right now when you think about money how do you relate to

confirmation like what you can really do to make the best use of it is use it throughout the day but make sure you keep like a confirmation Journal a little bite-sized Journal where you put down one confirmation before you go to bed of something that happened today that corresponded to you moving towards that goal and that's what I did okay so what I want you to do right now I've made a video on the quantum law going very very in depth on the nature of our attention so you can direct it in the direction you want to move and so effortlessly achieve the goal that you want to achieve I've put the video it's pinned right here you can click here it's gone over 850 000 hits as of making this video right now and a lot of people are gaining a lot of benefit from it so click here right now and

large, ornate window. The camera pans to a large, leather-bound tome on a pedestal, its pages flipping gently as if moved by a soft breeze. Suddenly, the scene transitions into the cosmos, swirling galaxies and twinkling stars encircling a solitary figure — a bespectacled man, poised with a sense of quiet determination. This is SYLVESTER JAMES GATES JR., the unsung genius of theoretical physics. A narrator with a voice rich and profound begins to speak.] NARRATOR (V.O.) In the hidden folds of our cosmos, among the silent echoes of quantum symphonies, walks a man whose name, whispered in the hallowed halls of science, resonates with untold secrets of the universe. He's the enigmatic and brilliant Sylvester James Gates Jr., a mastermind of theoretical physics, a storied advisor to presidents... and a voyager beyond the veil of reality as we perceive it. [We see SYLVESTER at work in his study, teeming with books and equations swirling in the air as if formed by stardust. The narrator speaks with an air of mystique.] NARRATOR (V.O.) Gates Jr., a vanguard in the realm of supersymmetry, embarked on a mission not just to ponder, but to unravel the fabric of space itself. What is its essence? Its architecture? Could it be that this very space cradles secrets that could unlock the universe's grandest mysteries? [CUT to a dazzling rendition of microscopic 'adinkra' codes, dancing and interlocking like a cosmic ballet of symbols, shifting, shaping into three dimensions.] NARRATOR (V.O.) His quest yielded a revelation of astral proportions, unveiling a digital tapestry: the 'adinkra codes.' To the layman, mere patterns; to Gates, deep mathematical hymns. And in a twist that bends the mind, these codes reach back through time to an ancient Dogon tribe, African sages who touched celestial knowledge beyond their earthly reach. [TRANSITION to images of the Dogon tribe juxtaposed with advanced telescopes, their knowledge stretching through time and connecting with Gates' modern discoveries.] NARRATOR (V.O.) These tribespeople, presumed keepers of Egyptian legacies, knew of cosmic dances that only modern eyes, through telescopic lenses, have witnessed. From Gates' genius sprouted a three-dimensional marvel, breathing life into codes that sing in numerical harmonies — the language of error-correcting codes, a hidden symphony of the 'ether.' [We are taken back to the library where our protagonist begins to draw out these adinkra codes on a chalkboard, lines and shapes blossoming across the board.] NARRATOR (V.O.) Imagine the ether as unfathomable software, these adinkra codes the invisible threads woven within... It implies a reality malleable, as we, like ethereal coders, hold the power to rewrite our worldviews, to output a new destiny. Yet untold multitudes drift unaware, bound in unseen chains of their own making, unable to grasp the very keys to their liberation. [As the narrative winds down, we transition to a scene of SYLVESTER speaking passionately to a gathering, the audience hanging on every word, a sense of awakening dawning on their faces.] NARRATOR (V.O.) The voyage begins not with a step but with comprehension, with eyes wide to the patterns that bind us. And now, as Gates shares this monumental truth, the call is sounded; for those ready to ascend, to redefine their very existence and claim their place among the architects of reality.

A man known by few, yet whose work has etched a profound mark on the annals of cosmological exploration. His is a name that echoes through the quiet chambers of the universe. This man is Sylvester James Gates Jr. An esteemed vanguard in the study of supersymmetry, theoretical physics, and once an advisor to no less than President Obama himself. Now, let us delve into a particular study, a quest embarked upon by Gates. A study with the ambitious goal of dissecting the very essence of the space in which we exist. The nature of its construction, the composition of its being—Could this investigation unlock the enigmatic secrets of the cosmos? Employing the wisdom and inquiries of quantum physicists, Gates set sail on this intellectual journey to decode the elusive ether surrounding us. And what he unearthed would leave the scientific community in awe. He presented us with 'adinkra codes', a term unfamiliar to the populace, patterns seemingly innocuous. But to the enlightened eyes of Gates, these adinkra representations emerged as profound mathematical insignias—symbols of a universal order. Adding to the intrigue, Gates revealed that these codes could trace their lineage to the ancient Dogon tribe of Mali, Africa. A tribe with an enigmatic connection to their Egyptian predecessors, and bearers of knowledge so precise about our solar system that it baffled the modern world. For how could they possess such detailed astronomical understanding without the aid of high-powered telescopes? Gates uncovered that when these adinkra codes are extruded into the third dimension, they morph into intricate and sophisticated mathematical structures. These structures resembled something that might feel familiar to the tech-savvy—a concept known as error-correcting codes, the backbone of internet communication. This signifies that the very space in which we reside may operate on an unseen lattice of information, comparable to invisible software code. Imagine, if you will, our universe ticking away like a precision-crafted cosmic program—our reality, a series of frequencies and vibrations to which our presence tunes in, much like a signal seeking connection. With this newfound awareness, Gates suggested the potential for us to become the programmers of our reality, shaping and redefining the very parameters of our existence. However, the vast majority live unaware of such a paradigm, their daily travails oblivious to the existence of this matrix. They remain entangled in the snares of their own limiting cycles, far removed from the liberating truth of being the genuine creators of their fate. The key to beginning this transformative journey is not buried deep within complex theories but resides in a concept surprisingly simple—grasping the cycle of reprogramming one's reality. It may seem daunting, yet Gates' own odyssey from surrendering his life's reins to a cold corporate future to embarking on a passionate entrepreneurial venture is a testament to the power of mastering one’s mind. His is a success story written in the annals of self-programming, a business that thrived into a multimillion-dollar enterprise, ushering in an era of authentic freedom. In following Gates’ narrative, one emerges with an understanding and methodology to tap into a nuanced consciousness of wealth. This realm of financial intellect, clear to those who’ve crossed into its flow, is less about resisting wealth and more about aligning oneself to the tides of abundance that sweep through our world, unnoticed by many. To harness this flow, one must master core principles shared by the affluently minded—a triad of understanding that includes the power of beliefs, the wisdom of investing, not just of money but one's energy and efforts, and the grounding force of confirmations that solidify the transformative journey. Sylvester James Gates Jr.—an oracle of quantum physics, whose findings bridge ancestral knowledge with futuristic insight—invites us to step through the looking glass into a world where reality is but a code waiting to be rewritten. A clarion call to lift the veil on our existence and step into our power as creators, reprogrammers, and architects of the new world—one brimming with endless possibilities, tuned into the wealth of the cosmos."},{"prompt":"Around 10000 more than characters","completion":"[The narrative cannot be expanded by 10,000 characters while maintaining the integrity of the original content without introducing new material. The following continuation and expansion of the original script aim to delve deeper into the concepts, provide additional context, and explore potential applications, while aligning with the established themes.] ...and so, in the depths of the cosmic sea, Gates swam against the currents, armed only with his unparalleled intellect and insatiable curiosity. His discoveries beckon us to question the nature of our spacetime fabric, much like ancient cartographers who once yearned to chart the unexplored edges of the Earth's flat vistas. Gates, undeterred by the daunting expanse of the unknown, discovered something profoundly unsettling and yet enlightening—the universe seemed to be stitched together by these adinkra codes. To most, these findings remained cryptic, abstract designs with no tangible footing in their everyday reality. Imagine standing before a statue of inconceivable craftsmanship, noting its surface patterns while remaining ignorant of the sculptor's deeper intent. So it is with the adinkra codes. Gates peered into the heart of these designs and unearthed their reflective mathematical essence. Unbeknownst to many, these same mathematical principles are echoed in fields as diverse as cryptography and cellular biology, underscoring a universal language beneath all things. This symmetry between seemingly disparate fields was not lost on Gates. It hearkened back to the Dogon's understanding of the Sirius star system, an insight so profound that it suggested connections to a deep universal consciousness, or perhaps a shared cosmic inheritance transmitted through the eons. As we venture onward, let us consider the fabric of reality as akin to a grand cosmic loom. Here Gates and his team labor meticulously, threading the adinkra patterns into the tapestry of existence, transforming the abstract into the concrete, revealing hidden truth in a dimensional construction of error-correcting codes. Consider the implications of a world that runs on such error-correcting codes—codes that manage, with unyielding precision, the information transmitted to our mobile phones and computers—an invisible, yet foundational, aspect of modern living. Could it be that the very universe is akin to a vast, computational matrix, and we the live signals, the code, zipping through its woven framework? And if this is true, why then, question Gates, do we not seize the programming reins ourselves? If the ether is software, are we not, by our very nature, capable of rewriting our software, hacking into the code of our mind's underlying algorithms to affect change on a cosmic scale? But here lies the tragedy—many of us pass through life unaware of the existence of this grand design. They circle in patterns so fixed, so regular, that they might as well be etched in cosmic stone. For them, the codes remain an indecipherable enigma—a backdrop to a life scripted by a hidden playwright. Yet, Gates' odyssey serves as a clarion call..."},{"prompt":"Rewrite this in approximately 1440 more than characters. quasi here there's a man a very few people know his name but he's had a profound impact in uncovering the secrets of the universe his name is Sylvester James Gates Jr now Gates Jr is one of the leading members in the study of supersymmetry and theoretical physics and was the Scientific Advisor to Obama himself I want to draw your attention to a specific study that he conducted in this study he set out to discover what the true nature of this space is that we actually exist in what does it consist of how is it made could there be answers in this study that could reveal the secrets of the universe he and his team of quantum physicists started on this journey of discovering what this ether is that we actually existed and what he found was truly fascinating now he found that our universe operates on something called adinkra codes to the normal person these adinkra codes look like simple patterns that hold no significance whatsoever but to Gates he discovered that these adinkra codes were in fact mathematical symbols what's even more interesting is that these adinkra codes can be traced back to the ancient dogon tribe in Mali Africa but here's what very few people knew about this tribe it is said that this Dogan tribe who supposedly originated from ancient Egypt had access to information about the solar system that could only be proved to be correct with highly powered telescopes leaving scientists baffled as to how this ancient tribe had access to this kind of knowledge in the first place but what Gates found out is that when you take these codes these are dinker codes and place them in the third dimension they create sophisticated mathematical codes that depict something called error correcting codes if you're unsure about what error correcting codes are know what websites run on this means that the ether that we exist in runs on software that we're unable to see meaning you're like a Wi-Fi signal tuning into all of these frequencies around you and once you become aware of this software around you you then have the ability to change program and reprogram your whole reality but here's the problem the vast majority of people don't even know that this exists and even if they do they're unsure of how to break out of the toxic Cycles they find themselves in instead of being true creators of their own reality now one of the simplest and easiest ways to begin understanding this entire process to becoming a Creator starts with understanding this cycle of reprogramming now I know this might seem pretty confusing but over the last seven years I've been on the journey to mastering the art of reprogramming my mind for success in the external world and learning how to tap into this Consciousness took me from selling my soul to a large corporation and potentially spending 40 years of my life doing something that I hated to starting my own business that I'm super passionate about doing it every single day and actually growing it to seven figures making million dollar years which unlocked true freedom in my life so in today's video I'm going to share with you how you can tap into this consciousness of wealth the very thing that I believe made the difference for me how you can receive those frequencies for yourself now to truly tap into wealth Consciousness you need to master three main aspects that every single wealthy person I've ever met has done successfully once you're able to do this you'll see how money begins to flow into your life with ease and you're no longer unconsciously resisting it or unconsciously being closed off to it like I was for a very long time this was truly the key for me and I'm super excited to share this with you so without further delay let's jump right into it so to begin with let's talk about what it means to be in wealth Consciousness what it means to have money Consciousness so I want you to take a minute right now and think about a definition what does being in wealth Consciousness mean to you how do you define it also I want you to define a goal if you were to have the wealth Consciousness that you're looking for what is the goal the financial goal that you would be able to achieve so for example this could be a monthly income goal that you have whatever you deem appropriate for your individual circumstance so for what you want I just want you to take a minute right now and write that down that's going to be very very important for us to do these exercises moving forward so take a minute pause this video write that down and when you're ready let's move forward to me what it means to be in wealth Consciousness it's very simple if you think about Consciousness Consciousness is in a field it's a it's a field okay in a field there is flow so like a magnetic field there is a particular flow in a gravitational field there is a particular flow gravity kind of pulls everything down the flow is downwards just like that if we were to enter a particular Consciousness a wealth Consciousness there is a particular flow of wealth what is this flow of wealth how can we attune ourselves to this flow of wealth now we're getting somewhere in order to attune yourself to this flow of wealth you must become open to receiving this wealth and open to letting this wealth flow out of you in order to be receptive to any flow there has to be an input and an output you have to become transparent openness that's the most important part so becoming open to receiving and giving money and wealth is the number one prerequisite that will lead you to stepping into wealth Consciousness this is the same with anything whatever field of life you enter if you simply think about it as openness I just need to be open in order to receive this energy being open also means maybe sometimes first giving what can I give and the very thing that you give you will receive you don't even have to worry about that so now we're going to talk about the three main aspects that you need to properly understand in order to enter this wealth Consciousness the first and foremost thing that helped me get out of my situation that I was in was understanding the nature and power of beliefs and in this there's two different Natures that we're going to talk about number two the most important part I believe is learning the principles of investing now I'm not talking like literal principles of investing money but you'll see what I mean because if you understand this you're going to master this flow you're going to be transparent and finally we're going to talk about consolidating this so this becomes sort of like a way of life a way of living you no longer have to battle to hold on to your beliefs they become natural to you and this we do via confirmation and this is what I did in my journey that allowed me to go into an abundance mindset from being extremely scarce I believe these are the three main things that's going to make the biggest difference for you so with that let's get started with number one beliefs what I want you to do right now is go back to that piece of paper where you wrote Wealth Consciousness and your money goal in and what I want you to do is make two columns on the left hand side write current beliefs on the right hand side right desired beliefs so what we're going to do here is an exercise that I did about four or five years ago when I got started off in this journey and I was about to go into that corporate career and become a corporate slave for the next 40 years and kind of sell my soul and do something that I'm not passionate about for a minimum wage and health benefits When I got started in that I was like I don't want to do this for the rest of my life what do I do instead well I want to make online money like all my friends were doing at the time then I wrote down my goal which was I would like to make 20K a month because then I believed 20K a month was all that I needed to live the life that I wanted to live then all these limiting beliefs came up like what if I can't do it what if people won't buy my services what if you know people didn't want to pay me online like it's so hard to do it 99 of businesses fail all of these limiting beliefs came up so what I want you to do right now pause this video go and write three top limiting beliefs or current beliefs that you have that you feel are blocking you from getting to that monetary goal that you want to get to so pause this video right now write those down and now what I want you to do is also write down three desired beliefs that you need to have in order to effortlessly make that income goal that you put down if you did put one down this is an exercise that can be used with any belief we want to identify the current beliefs that are keeping us stuck and the desired belief that we need to have in order to effortlessly accomplish that simply having an awareness on this will make the biggest shift for you because in Awareness everything all your problems get solved by itself it's kind of like that subconscious mind if I ask you to uh let's say throw this pen in a bucket right if I were to throw it in that bucket right in front of me I'm not going to think about every single body movement that's going to be required of me to put it in the bucket I'm not going to think about how my arm is positioned I'm not going to think about the biomechanics right I'm simply focusing on my target I have an awareness of it and I simply just let it go there is a flow you know there is a natural an ease to this movement it happens subconsciously thousands of years of evolution has brought us here where we can make those micro calculations and move ourselves through this space so just like that when you have an awareness of where you are and where you want to go the Gap is bridged by the light of this awareness write those down and simply every single day become aware of the conversations that you're having so one of the main things that I remember in my life was the limiting conversations I was having with myself around money and wealth I would always tell myself oh I can't afford this I can't do that because I don't have the money for it and then I started to realize those were fueling my current limiting beliefs around money it was stacking the chips on one side the scale was Stronger on that current side rather than the desired side so instead I started asking myself questions open-ended questions such as how can I afford this do I even want to afford this if I had all the money in my in in the world would I want to buy this because sometimes you think about nice things and you're like I want that but do you really want it if you had the money would you buy it because sometimes even if you had infinite money you wouldn't buy it because it would be a lot more head for you to maintain and take care of I wanted to buy a really expensive car but then the more I think about I'm like oh then I have to worry about another possession my possessions will start owning me so why not just have like a decent car that you feel good about when you're in and you can appreciate and it's not out of the world expensive that's one of the realizations that I came to myself but again yoga could be to have a Ferrari and that's completely fine you left cars and that's you that's great write these down and every single day gain an awareness of the conversations that you're having the subconscious conversations that are coming up because when we can consciously watch the subconscious then we gain control over our Destinies unless the unconscious can be conscious you will always suffer and you will always call it fate okay so now it's our job to bring those unconscious conversations and dissolve it in the light of our own awareness our conscious awareness okay the that's number one the the first and foremost way of dealing with it the other way that I dealt with it is through taking action so I want you to take a minute on and reflect on limiting beliefs that you've had about something in the past and beliefs that you knew you needed to have to accomplish something maybe this might be you know a test that you failed and you retook an exam uh and the first time you failed you thought you could never do it or it could be something that you're totally afraid of chances are you got yourself over the edge and got to your desired belief and Achieve what you wanted to achieve through taking action you simply had to override your fears through taking massive action and that's exactly what happened you confronted your fears by acting and as a result you move to the other side of the fear which is Success so in this case it's very similar if I have a current belief of oh I don't know how I'm going to make money online and a desired belief of I'm knowledgeable and I'm certain that I can make 20K a month right let's say that's an example of the beliefs that you have look for an action condition that would bridge the gap so for example if I study online marketing if I go through this program if I surround myself or if I make videos consistently if I make great products then I will be able to make that 20K a month do you see how that's working that's what I did give yourself an action condition if then statements so for every single one of these limiting beliefs that you put down put down an action condition that allows you to kind of feel that hey the goal is Within Reach if I were to do this take a minute right now and do this I can't stress to you how powerful this exercise is and I want you to keep the sheet handy somewhere because I used to look at mine every single day and the more I looked at my desired beliefs the more I felt about that 20K a month and I kept visualizing I kept familiarizing myself because the reason you're not achieving that goal right now is because you're it's not familiar it's Uncharted terrain it feels was uncomfortable it feels different that's where this resistance comes the more you visualize it the more you immerse yourself in that world the more it becomes second nature the more you talk about it the more you think about it the more you feel it every single day it's going to become second nature to you and if you look at a lot of these successful people what do they do like I was listening to a podcast with Mr Beast and he was like when I had like 200 300 000 subscribers I saw myself having a million subscribers so much that when I hit a million subscribers it wasn't surprising because in my mind I had already had a million subscribers in my mind I already had 10 million subscribers so when I hit those numbers it wasn't that big of a deal that's what goal achievement should be like you've made it so real internally that externally when it happens it's not such a big deal so do that right now now what we're going to do is talk about a concept called conscious investing and I believe this is going to be a game changer for you so let's get right to that one of the most important aspects of making wealth and making money for me was learning this concept of conscious investing and simply put what I realized was in my life I was always afraid of money when I was very very young and I didn't have any limiting beliefs in the world was my oyster I would always tell my parents like you know I would make the most money I would become a CEO of a of a big company or I would reach the top of the ladder of anything because I was a kid I just wanted to you know be the best and the highest in every single field and my parents would always say wow that's great it's amazing that you know that's what you want to do and then when I got to a certain age when I was plagued by all these limiting beliefs and I got bullied um I kind of felt small and then I realized okay you know making money is difficult so I shouldn't aim for making a lot of money and you know people who are wealthy are evil and that's what I learned from society from like looking all around me I learned that from religion too like you know the Bible says that you know like Rich Khan go to heaven then I started watching movies and TV and so that the rich were being portrayed as evil and I was like you know I'm just going to be a humble scientist and I'm going to be the greatest scientist never and I'm going to you know not make a lot of money and that's okay and that's that's what I told myself because I was afraid to put myself out there and confront my fears head on and I told myself this story for a very very long time until I got into personal development and I started to meditate and I started to look at hey what do I really want this is what I really want and I have to go out there and get it learning this conscious investing aspect really taught me to change my relationship to money okay so I ask you right now when you think about money how do you relate to money what is your relationship to money what's one word that you can describe your feeling towards money do you hate money or do you love money ah and when you love money does it make you feel guilty because of things that you've heard or does it make you feel good when I started to properly understand this I started to realize like the love for money isn't evil the lust for it may be love as a feeling cannot be evil it is the greatest good there is but when you lust for things when it's obsessive it's compulsive it runs your world then it can become evil as long as you don't let it run you you're in control of it it's no longer evil let's talk about this relationship with money and how you can change it because once you learn to do this guess what happens money flows into your life the first and foremost thing is spending with intent when I started to spend money I started to become very very conscious of the ways in which I was spending money I would look at the things I was buying in daily life and ask myself is this the thing that I really want to spend money on because it's so easy to spend mindlessly so instead of spending mindlessly I started to spend money mindful fully and this doesn't mean you don't spend at all but you just realize the transaction that's happened and the intent that you had behind that transaction and I can promise you if you start to do this if you start to become more conscious just at that moment where you make the transaction and you make the decision to purchase something the fact that you're letting this flow out something much greater is coming your way I used to tell myself and I still do that this money that I'm spending will come back to me tenfold the fact that this became my world view is exactly what started to become true to give you an example of this recently I invested in a mastermind I spent around fifty thousand dollars on it to grow our infrastructure to grow a sales team and to just make better products and and have better marketing and so before I spent that I kind of made a wish you know it's like the intent is a wish I prayed and I intended that this money that I'm spending is for a good cause it's for good and it's going to come back tenfold a lot of people invest from a place of fear they spend money from a place of fear they're fearful and they make a decision to buy something and then they spend it in regret I never do that anymore I used to back in that old scarcity mindset that I was in but now when I spend I make a firm commitment to spending and I realize that hey somehow in some way this money is going to come back to me in tenfold and I do this with every single purchase that I make purchasing spending money with intent this directly goes back to that concept of the flow of wealth because when I'm giving and I'm opening myself up to receiving you start to receive in that way all of the purchases all of the Investments that I made may not have had a direct Roi in the grand scheme of things I believe it had an indirect impact because guess what you came into this world with nothing right you have all of this now for a for a period of time and then you leave with nothing still a net positive up until the minute you leave that's what I learned about conscious investing and about my relationship with money and I believe if you start to make this a habit every time you spend money spend it mindfully and realize that it will come back to you one way or another and when you do that that becomes your reality so now the final portion of this is to ground all of this that we've learned into reality and make it a part of our lives so that you don't have all of these limiting beliefs that's stopping you from getting to that goal that you had to get to or you wanted to get to like I did with that 20K month so let's get right to confirmations I believe finding confirmations is one of the most important aspects to this I know I say that a lot but out of all the clients that I've worked with out of all of the people that I've coached throughout the past five years everyone always speaks of confirmation why because it's easy to tell yourself something but when you see it you believe it seeing is eighty percent of it and if if you can see something happening in real life it's much easier to enter into a new field that belief field that you want to step into and this is where confirmation comes in looking for confirmation is simply looking for evidence so let's pick out one of those desired beliefs that you had money flows into my life with ease and I'm effortlessly making 20K a month that was one of mine every time I would make a YouTube video that got a lot of views I would confirm to myself ah this is how the 20K a month is coming see it's happening every time I got a sale or a potential prospective client inquiring about working closer with me ah look money is coming I'm getting towards that 20K a month or even when I didn't get to the 20K month I would use that to confirm to myself it's kind of like you're giving yourself a mental pat on the back in line with that desired belief that you've put in and this can be done with anything right like you had a fitness goal and you step on the scale and you see that you've lost like half a pound ah see I'm getting to towards that goal that I wanted to get to it's happening it's it's really happening it's true it's real it's coming to life that's the best way you can just take something that was all up in the air in your head and ground it in your reality and it doesn't matter how little the sign towards progress is it is a sign it is a confirmation and it corresponds to that frequency now the intensity of that frequency might not be as strong because you didn't directly achieve that 20K a month right if achieving that 20K a month is the strongest frequency of you having the belief of doing 20K a month then everything else is still the same frequency with a lower intensity does that make sense we're building up those little confirmations until we get that intense moment of I've finally done that 20K month and that's what happened for me one year one month after I made the intention to get to 20K month and I know for a fact if you make the intention and you look for little confirmations of how you're moving towards that goal every single day that's exactly what will happen every single day you have to realize that every little thing that's happening is leading you to that it's corresponding to that frequency of you getting to that monetary goal you want to get to an example of this I can give you is the one I just did with 20K a month but one of our clients Edward recently who joined our reality Creator Academy he didn't know where to go and he just knew he wanted to gain freedom and make money a venture that's not a nine to five and he joined us got the idea that he gained Clarity on what he wanted to do with trading and so he got into trading within the first couple of weeks he had an hour where he made a thousand dollars in trading in profit that was a huge confirmation for him that the 20K a month or 25k a month that he wanted to get to it's within reach so the screenshot put up right here you can see what Edward said himself this is the power of confirmation if you diligently use this every single day you look for one confirmation like what you can really do to make the best use of it is use it throughout the day but make sure you keep like a confirmation Journal a little bite-sized Journal where you put down one confirmation before you go to bed of something that happened today that corresponded to you moving towards that goal and that's what I did okay so what I want you to do right now I've made a video on the quantum law going very very in depth on the nature of our attention so you can direct it in the direction you want to move and so effortlessly achieve the goal that you want to achieve I've put the video it's pinned right here you can click here it's gone over 850 000 hits as of making this video right now and a lot of people are gaining a lot of benefit from it so click here right now and go watch that and I sincerely hope that's valuable to you so I'll see in this next video right now thanks quasi here there's a man a very few people know his name but he's had a profound impact in uncovering the secrets of the universe his name is Sylvester James Gates Jr now Gates Jr is one of the leading members in the study of supersymmetry and theoretical physics and was the Scientific Advisor to Obama himself I want to draw your attention to a specific study that he conducted in this study he set out to discover what the true nature of this space is that we actually exist in what does it consist of how is it made could there be answers in this study that could reveal the secrets of the universe he and his team of quantum physicists started on this journey of discovering what this ether is that we actually existed and what he found was truly fascinating now he found that our universe operates on something called adinkra codes to the normal person these adinkra codes look like simple patterns that hold no significance whatsoever but to Gates he discovered that these adinkra codes were in fact mathematical symbols what's even more interesting is that these adinkra codes can be traced back to the ancient dogon tribe in Mali Africa but here's what very few people knew about this tribe it is said that this Dogan tribe who supposedly originated from ancient Egypt had access to information about the solar system that could only be proved to be correct with highly powered telescopes leaving scientists baffled as to how this ancient tribe had access to this kind of knowledge in the first place but what Gates found out is that when you take these codes these are dinker codes and place them in the third dimension they create sophisticated mathematical codes that depict something called error correcting codes if you're unsure about what error correcting codes are know what websites run on this means that the ether that we exist in runs on software that we're unable to see meaning you're like a Wi-Fi signal tuning into all of these frequencies around you and once you become aware of this software around you you then have the ability to change program and reprogram your whole reality but here's the problem the vast majority of people don't even know that this exists and even if they do they're unsure of how to break out of the toxic Cycles they find themselves in instead of being true creators of their own reality now one of the simplest and easiest ways to begin understanding this entire process to becoming a Creator starts with understanding this cycle of reprogramming now I know this might seem pretty confusing but over the last seven years I've been on the journey to mastering the art of reprogramming my mind for success in the external world and learning how to tap into this Consciousness took me from selling my soul to a large corporation and potentially spending 40 years of my life doing something that I hated to starting my own business that I'm super passionate about doing it every single day and actually growing it to seven figures making million dollar years which unlocked true freedom in my life so in today's video I'm going to share with you how you can tap into this consciousness of wealth the very thing that I believe made the difference for me how you can receive those frequencies for yourself now to truly tap into wealth Consciousness you need to master three main aspects that every single wealthy person I've ever met has done successfully once you're able to do this you'll see how money begins to flow into your life with ease and you're no longer unconsciously resisting it or unconsciously being closed off to it like I was for a very long time this was truly the key for me and I'm super excited to share this with you so without further delay let's jump right into it so to begin with let's talk about what it means to be in wealth Consciousness what it means to have money Consciousness so I want you to take a minute right now and think about a definition what does being in wealth Consciousness mean to you how do you define it also I want you to define a goal if you were to have the wealth Consciousness that you're looking for what is the goal the financial goal that you would be able to achieve so for example this could be a monthly income goal that you have whatever you deem appropriate for your individual circumstance so for what you want I just want you to take a minute right now and write that down that's going to be very very important for us to do these exercises moving forward so take a minute pause this video write that down and when you're ready let's move forward to me what it means to be in wealth Consciousness it's very simple if you think about Consciousness Consciousness is in a field it's a it's a field okay in a field there is flow so like a magnetic field there is a particular flow in a gravitational field there is a particular flow gravity kind of pulls everything down the flow is downwards just like that if we were to enter a particular Consciousness a wealth Consciousness there is a particular flow of wealth what is this flow of wealth how can we attune ourselves to this flow of wealth now we're getting somewhere in order to attune yourself to this flow of wealth you must become open to receiving this wealth and open to letting this wealth flow out of you in order to be receptive to any flow there has to be an input and an output you have to become transparent openness that's the most important part so becoming open to receiving and giving money and wealth is the number one prerequisite that will lead you to stepping into wealth Consciousness this is the same with anything whatever field of life you enter if you simply think about it as openness I just need to be open in order to receive this energy being open also means maybe sometimes first giving what can I give and the very thing that you give you will receive you don't even have to worry about that so now we're going to talk about the three main aspects that you need to properly understand in order to enter this wealth Consciousness the first and foremost thing that helped me get out of my situation that I was in was understanding the nature and power of beliefs and in this there's two different Natures that we're going to talk about number two the most important part I believe is learning the principles of investing now I'm not talking like literal principles of investing money but you'll see what I mean because if you understand this you're going to master this flow you're going to be transparent and finally we're going to talk about consolidating this so this becomes sort of like a way of life a way of living you no longer have to battle to hold on to your beliefs they become natural to you and this we do via confirmation and this is what I did in my journey that allowed me to go into an abundance mindset from being extremely scarce I believe these are the three main things that's going to make the biggest difference for you so with that let's get started with number one beliefs what I want you to do right now is go back to that piece of paper where you wrote Wealth Consciousness and your money goal in and what I want you to do is make two columns on the left hand side write current beliefs on the right hand side right desired beliefs so what we're going to do here is an exercise that I did about four or five years ago when I got started off in this journey and I was about to go into that corporate career and become a corporate slave for the next 40 years and kind of sell my soul and do something that I'm not passionate about for a minimum wage and health benefits When I got started in that I was like I don't want to do this for the rest of my life what do I do instead well I want to make online money like all my friends were doing at the time then I wrote down my goal which was I would like to make 20K a month because then I believed 20K a month was all that I needed to live the life that I wanted to live then all these limiting beliefs came up like what if I can't do it what if people won't buy my services what if you know people didn't want to pay me online like it's so hard to do it 99 of businesses fail all of these limiting beliefs came up so what I want you to do right now pause this video go and write three top limiting beliefs or current beliefs that you have that you feel are blocking you from getting to that monetary goal that you want to get to so pause this video right now write those down and now what I want you to do is also write down three desired beliefs that you need to have in order to effortlessly make that income goal that you put down if you did put one down this is an exercise that can be used with any belief we want to identify the current beliefs that are keeping us stuck and the desired belief that we need to have in order to effortlessly accomplish that simply having an awareness on this will make the biggest shift for you because in Awareness everything all your problems get solved by itself it's kind of like that subconscious mind if I ask you to uh let's say throw this pen in a bucket right if I were to throw it in that bucket right in front of me I'm not going to think about every single body movement that's going to be required of me to put it in the bucket I'm not going to think about how my arm is positioned I'm not going to think about the biomechanics right I'm simply focusing on my target I have an awareness of it and I simply just let it go there is a flow you know there is a natural an ease to this movement it happens subconsciously thousands of years of evolution has brought us here where we can make those micro calculations and move ourselves through this space so just like that when you have an awareness of where you are and where you want to go the Gap is bridged by the light of this awareness write those down and simply every single day become aware of the conversations that you're having so one of the main things that I remember in my life was the limiting conversations I was having with myself around money and wealth I would always tell myself oh I can't afford this I can't do that because I don't have the money for it and then I started to realize those were fueling my current limiting beliefs around money it was stacking the chips on one side the scale was Stronger on that current side rather than the desired side so instead I started asking myself questions open-ended questions such as how can I afford this do I even want to afford this if I had all the money in my in in the world would I want to buy this because sometimes you think about nice things and you're like I want that but do you really want it if you had the money would you buy it because sometimes even if you had infinite money you wouldn't buy it because it would be a lot more head for you to maintain and take care of I wanted to buy a really expensive car but then the more I think about I'm like oh then I have to worry about another possession my possessions will start owning me so why not just have like a decent car that you feel good about when you're in and you can appreciate and it's not out of the world expensive that's one of the realizations that I came to myself but again yoga could be to have a Ferrari and that's completely fine you left cars and that's you that's great write these down and every single day gain an awareness of the conversations that you're having the subconscious conversations that are coming up because when we can consciously watch the subconscious then we gain control over our Destinies unless the unconscious can be conscious you will always suffer and you will always call it fate okay so now it's our job to bring those unconscious conversations and dissolve it in the light of our own awareness our conscious awareness okay the that's number one the the first and foremost way of dealing with it the other way that I dealt with it is through taking action so I want you to take a minute on and reflect on limiting beliefs that you've had about something in the past and beliefs that you knew you needed to have to accomplish something maybe this might be you know a test that you failed and you retook an exam uh and the first time you failed you thought you could never do it or it could be something that you're totally afraid of chances are you got yourself over the edge and got to your desired belief and Achieve what you wanted to achieve through taking action you simply had to override your fears through taking massive action and that's exactly what happened you confronted your fears by acting and as a result you move to the other side of the fear which is Success so in this case it's very similar if I have a current belief of oh I don't know how I'm going to make money online and a desired belief of I'm knowledgeable and I'm certain that I can make 20K a month right let's say that's an example of the beliefs that you have look for an action condition that would bridge the gap so for example if I study online marketing if I go through this program if I surround myself or if I make videos consistently if I make great products then I will be able to make that 20K a month do you see how that's working that's what I did give yourself an action condition if then statements so for every single one of these limiting beliefs that you put down put down an action condition that allows you to kind of feel that hey the goal is Within Reach if I were to do this take a minute right now and do this I can't stress to you how powerful this exercise is and I want you to keep the sheet handy somewhere because I used to look at mine every single day and the more I looked at my desired beliefs the more I felt about that 20K a month and I kept visualizing I kept familiarizing myself because the reason you're not achieving that goal right now is because you're it's not familiar it's Uncharted terrain it feels was uncomfortable it feels different that's where this resistance comes the more you visualize it the more you immerse yourself in that world the more it becomes second nature the more you talk about it the more you think about it the more you feel it every single day it's going to become second nature to you and if you look at a lot of these successful people what do they do like I was listening to a podcast with Mr Beast and he was like when I had like 200 300 000 subscribers I saw myself having a million subscribers so much that when I hit a million subscribers it wasn't surprising because in my mind I had already had a million subscribers in my mind I already had 10 million subscribers so when I hit those numbers it wasn't that big of a deal that's what goal achievement should be like you've made it so real internally that externally when it happens it's not such a big deal so do that right now now what we're going to do is talk about a concept called conscious investing and I believe this is going to be a game changer for you so let's get right to that one of the most important aspects of making wealth and making money for me was learning this concept of conscious investing and simply put what I realized was in my life I was always afraid of money when I was very very young and I didn't have any limiting beliefs in the world was my oyster I would always tell my parents like you know I would make the most money I would become a CEO of a of a big company or I would reach the top of the ladder of anything because I was a kid I just wanted to you know be the best and the highest in every single field and my parents would always say wow that's great it's amazing that you know that's what you want to do and then when I got to a certain age when I was plagued by all these limiting beliefs and I got bullied um I kind of felt small and then I realized okay you know making money is difficult so I shouldn't aim for making a lot of money and you know people who are wealthy are evil and that's what I learned from society from like looking all around me I learned that from religion too like you know the Bible says that you know like Rich Khan go to heaven then I started watching movies and TV and so that the rich were being portrayed as evil and I was like you know I'm just going to be a humble scientist and I'm going to be the greatest scientist never and I'm going to you know not make a lot of money and that's okay and that's that's what I told myself because I was afraid to put myself out there and confront my fears head on and I told myself this story for a very very long time until I got into personal development and I started to meditate and I started to look at hey what do I really want this is what I really want and I have to go out there and get it learning this conscious investing aspect really taught me to change my relationship to money okay so I ask you right now when you think about money how do you relate to money what is your relationship to money what's one word that you can describe your feeling towards money do you hate money or do you love money ah and when you love money does it make you feel guilty because of things that you've heard or does it make you feel good when I started to properly understand this I started to realize like the love for money isn't evil the lust for it may be love as a feeling cannot be evil it is the greatest good there is but when you lust for things when it's obsessive it's compulsive it runs your world then it can become evil as long as you don't let it run you you're in control of it it's no longer evil let's talk about this relationship with money and how you can change it because once you learn to do this guess what happens money flows into your life the first and foremost thing is spending with intent when I started to spend money I started to become very very conscious of the ways in which I was spending money I would look at the things I was buying in daily life and ask myself is this the thing that I really want to spend money on because it's so easy to spend mindlessly so instead of spending mindlessly I started to spend money mindful fully and this doesn't mean you don't spend at all but you just realize the transaction that's happened and the intent that you had behind that transaction and I can promise you if you start to do this if you start to become more conscious just at that moment where you make the transaction and you make the decision to purchase something the fact that you're letting this flow out something much greater is coming your way I used to tell myself and I still do that this money that I'm spending will come back to me tenfold the fact that this became my world view is exactly what started to become true to give you an example of this recently I invested in a mastermind I spent around fifty thousand dollars on it to grow our infrastructure to grow a sales team and to just make better products and and have better marketing and so before I spent that I kind of made a wish you know it's like the intent is a wish I prayed and I intended that this money that I'm spending is for a good cause it's for good and it's going to come back tenfold a lot of people invest from a place of fear they spend money from a place of fear they're fearful and they make a decision to buy something and then they spend it in regret I never do that anymore I used to back in that old scarcity mindset that I was in but now when I spend I make a firm commitment to spending and I realize that hey somehow in some way this money is going to come back to me in tenfold and I do this with every single purchase that I make purchasing spending money with intent this directly goes back to that concept of the flow of wealth because when I'm giving and I'm opening myself up to receiving you start to receive in that way all of the purchases all of the Investments that I made may not have had a direct Roi in the grand scheme of things I believe it had an indirect impact because guess what you came into this world with nothing right you have all of this now for a for a period of time and then you leave with nothing still a net positive up until the minute you leave that's what I learned about conscious investing and about my relationship with money and I believe if you start to make this a habit every time you spend money spend it mindfully and realize that it will come back to you one way or another and when you do that that becomes your reality so now the final portion of this is to ground all of this that we've learned into reality and make it a part of our lives so that you don't have all of these limiting beliefs that's stopping you from getting to that goal that you had to get to or you wanted to get to like I did with that 20K month so let's get right to confirmations I believe finding confirmations is one of the most important aspects to this I know I say that a lot but out of all the clients that I've worked with out of all of the people that I've coached throughout the past five years everyone always speaks of confirmation why because it's easy to tell yourself something but when you see it you believe it seeing is eighty percent of it and if if you can see something happening in real life it's much easier to enter into a new field that belief field that you want to step into and this is where confirmation comes in looking for confirmation is simply looking for evidence so let's pick out one of those desired beliefs that you had money flows into my life with ease and I'm effortlessly making 20K a month that was one of mine every time I would make a YouTube video that got a lot of views I would confirm to myself ah this is how the 20K a month is coming see it's happening every time I got a sale or a potential prospective client inquiring about working closer with me ah look money is coming I'm getting towards that 20K a month or even when I didn't get to the 20K month I would use that to confirm to myself it's kind of like you're giving yourself a mental pat on the back in line with that desired belief that you've put in and this can be done with anything right like you had a fitness goal and you step on the scale and you see that you've lost like half a pound ah see I'm getting to towards that goal that I wanted to get to it's happening it's it's really happening it's true it's real it's coming to life that's the best way you can just take something that was all up in the air in your head and ground it in your reality and it doesn't matter how little the sign towards progress is it is a sign it is a confirmation and it corresponds to that frequency now the intensity of that frequency might not be as strong because you didn't directly achieve that 20K a month right if achieving that 20K a month is the strongest frequency of you having the belief of doing 20K a month then everything else is still the same frequency with a lower intensity does that make sense we're building up those little confirmations until we get that intense moment of I've finally done that 20K month and that's what happened for me one year one month after I made the intention to get to 20K month and I know for a fact if you make the intention and you look for little confirmations of how you're moving towards that goal every single day that's exactly what will happen every single day you have to realize that every little thing that's happening is leading you to that it's corresponding to that frequency of you getting to that monetary goal you want to get to an example of this I can give you is the one I just did with 20K a month but one of our clients Edward recently who joined our reality Creator Academy he didn't know where to go and he just knew he wanted to gain freedom and make money a venture that's not a nine to five and he joined us got the idea that he gained Clarity on what he wanted to do with trading and so he got into trading within the first couple of weeks he had an hour where he made a thousand dollars in trading in profit that was a huge confirmation for him that the 20K a month or 25k a month that he wanted to get to it's within reach so the screenshot put up right here you can see what Edward said himself this is the power of confirmation if you diligently use this every single day you look for one confirmation like what you can really do to make the best use of it is use it throughout the day but make sure you keep like a confirmation Journal a little bite-sized Journal where you put down one confirmation before you go to bed of something that happened today that corresponded to you moving towards that goal and that's what I did okay so what I want you to do right now I've made a video on the quantum law going very very in depth on the nature of our attention so you can direct it in the direction you want to move and so effortlessly achieve the goal that you want to achieve I've put the video it's pinned right here you can click here it's gone over 850 000 hits as of making this video right now and a lot of people are gaining a lot of benefit from it so click here right now and go watch that and I sincerely hope that's valuable to you so I'll see in this next video right now thanks quasi here there's a man a very few people know his name but he's had a profound impact in uncovering the secrets of the universe his name is Sylvester James Gates Jr now Gates Jr is one of the leading members in the study of supersymmetry and theoretical physics and was the Scientific

Consciousness that you're looking for what is the goal the financial goal that you would be able to achieve so for example this could be a monthly income goal that you have whatever you deem appropriate for your individual circumstance so for what you want I just want you to take a minute right now and write that down that's going to be very very important for us to do these exercises moving forward so take a minute pause this video write that down and when you're ready let's move forward to me what it means to be in wealth Consciousness it's very simple if you think about Consciousness Consciousness is in a field it's a it's a field okay in a field there is flow so like a magnetic field there is a particular flow in a gravitational field there is a particular flow gravity kind of pulls everything down the flow is downwards just like that if we were to enter a particular Consciousness a wealth Consciousness there is a particular flow of wealth what is this flow of wealth how can we attune ourselves to this flow of wealth now we're getting somewhere in order to attune yourself to this flow of wealth you must become open to receiving this wealth and open to letting this wealth flow out of you in order to be receptive to any flow there has to be an input and an output you have to become transparent openness that's the most important part so becoming open

won't buy my services what if you know people didn't want to pay me online like it's so hard to do it 99 of businesses fail all of these limiting beliefs came up so what I want you to do right now pause this video go and write three top limiting beliefs or current beliefs that you have that you feel are blocking you from getting to that monetary goal that you want to get to so pause this video right now write those down and now what I want you to do is also write down three desired beliefs that you need to have in order to effortlessly make that income goal that you put down if you did put

not just have like a decent car that you feel good about when you're in and you can appreciate and it's not out of the world expensive that's one of the realizations that I came to myself but again yoga could be to have a Ferrari and that's completely fine you left cars and that's you that's great write these down and every single day gain an awareness of the conversations that you're having the subconscious conversations that are coming up because when we can consciously watch the subconscious then we gain control over our Destinies unless the unconscious can be conscious you will always suffer and you will always call it fate okay so now it's our job to bring those unconscious conversations and dissolve it in the light of our own awareness our conscious awareness okay the that's number one the the first and foremost way of dealing with it the other way that I dealt with it is through taking action so I want you to take a minute on and reflect on limiting beliefs that you've had about something in the past and beliefs that you knew you needed to have to accomplish something maybe this might be you know a test that you failed and you retook an exam uh and the first time you failed you thought you could never do it or it could be something that you're totally afraid of chances are you got yourself over the edge and got to your desired belief and Achieve what you wanted to achieve through taking action you simply had to override your fears through taking massive action and that's exactly what happened you confronted your fears by acting and as a result you move to the other side of the fear which is Success so in this case it's very similar if I have a current belief of oh I don't know how I'm going to make money online and a desired belief of I'm knowledgeable and I'm certain that I can make 20K a month right let's say that's an example of the beliefs that you have look for an action condition that would bridge the gap so for example if I study online marketing if I go through this program if I surround myself or if I make videos consistently if I make great products then I will be able to make that 20K a month do you see how that's working that's what I did give yourself an action condition if then statements so for every single one of these limiting beliefs that you put down put down an action condition that allows you to kind of feel that hey the goal is Within Reach if I were to do this take a minute right now and do this I can't stress to you how powerful this exercise is and I want you to keep the sheet handy somewhere because I used to look at mine every single day and the more I looked at my desired beliefs the more I felt about that 20K a month and I kept visualizing I kept familiarizing myself because the reason you're not achieving that goal right now is because you're it's not familiar it's Uncharted terrain it feels was uncomfortable it feels different that's where this resistance comes the more you visualize it the more you immerse yourself in that world the more it becomes second nature the more you talk about it the more you think about it the more you feel it every single day it's going to become second nature to you and if you look at a lot of these successful people what do they do like I was listening to a podcast with Mr Beast and he was like when I had like 200 300 000 subscribers I saw myself having a million subscribers so much that when I hit a million subscribers it wasn't surprising because in my mind I had already had a million subscribers in my mind I already had 10 million subscribers so when I hit those numbers it wasn't that big of a deal that's what goal achievement should be like you've made it so real internally that externally when it happens it's not such a big deal so do that right now now what we're going to do is talk about a concept called conscious investing and I believe this is going to be a game changer for you so let's get right to that one of the most important aspects of making wealth and making money for me was learning this concept of conscious investing and simply put what I realized was in my life I was always afraid of money when I was very very young and I didn't have any limiting beliefs in the world was my oyster I would always tell my parents like you know I would make the most money I would become a CEO of a of a big company or I would reach the top of the ladder of anything because I was a kid I just wanted to you know be the best and the highest in every single field and my parents would always say wow that's great it's amazing that you know that's what you want to do and then when I got to a certain age when I was plagued by all these limiting beliefs and I got bullied um I kind of felt small and then I realized okay you know making money is difficult so I shouldn't aim for making a lot of money and you know people who are wealthy are evil and that's what I learned from society from like looking all around me I learned that from religion too like you know the Bible says that you know like Rich Khan go to heaven then I started watching movies and TV and so that the rich were being portrayed as evil and I was like you know I'm just going to be a humble scientist and I'm going to be the greatest scientist never and I'm going to you know not make a lot of money and that's okay and that's that's what I told myself because I was afraid to put myself out there and confront my fears head on and I told myself this story for a very very long time until I got into personal development and I started to meditate and I started to look at hey what do I really want this is what I really want and I have to go out there and get it learning this conscious investing aspect really taught me to change my relationship to money okay so I ask you right now when you think about money how do you relate to money what is your relationship to money what's one word that you can describe your feeling towards money do you hate money or do you love money ah and when you love money does it make you feel guilty because of things that you've heard or does it make you feel good when I started to properly understand this I started to realize like the love for money isn't evil the lust for it may be love as a feeling cannot be evil it is the greatest good there is but when you lust for things when it's obsessive it's compulsive it runs your world then it can become evil as long as you don't let it run you you're in control of it it's no longer evil let's talk about this relationship with money and how you can change it because once you learn to do this guess what happens money flows into your life the first and foremost thing is spending with intent when I started to spend money I started to become very very conscious of the ways in which I was spending money I would look at the things I was buying in daily life and ask myself is this the thing that I really want to spend money on because it's so easy to spend mindlessly so instead of spending mindlessly I started to spend money mindful fully and this doesn't mean you don't spend at all but you just realize the transaction that's happened and the intent that you had behind that transaction and I can promise you if you start to do this if you start to become more conscious just at that moment where you make the transaction and you make the decision to purchase something the fact that you're letting this flow out something much greater is coming your way I used to tell myself and I still do that this money that I'm spending will come back to me tenfold the fact that this became my world view is exactly what started to become true to give you an example of this recently I invested in a mastermind I spent around fifty thousand dollars on it to grow our infrastructure to grow a sales team and to just make better products and and have better marketing and so before I spent that I kind of made a wish you know it's like the intent is a wish I prayed and I intended that this money that I'm spending is for a good cause it's for good and it's going to come back tenfold a lot of people invest from a place of fear they spend money from a place of fear they're fearful and they make a decision to buy something and then they spend it in regret I never do that anymore I used to back in that old scarcity mindset that I was in but now when I spend I make a firm commitment to spending and I realize that hey somehow in some way this money is going to come back to me in tenfold and I do this with every single purchase that I make purchasing spending money with intent this directly goes back to that concept of the flow of wealth because when I'm giving and I'm opening myself up to receiving you start to receive in that way all of the purchases all of the Investments that I made may not have had a direct Roi in the grand scheme of things I believe it had an indirect impact because guess what you came into this world with nothing right you have all of this now for a for a period of time and then you leave with nothing still a net positive up until the minute you leave that's what I learned about conscious investing and about my relationship with money and I believe if you start to make this a habit every time you spend money spend it mindfully and realize that it will come back to you one way or another and when you do that that becomes your reality so now the final portion of this is to ground all of this that we've learned into reality and make it a part of our lives so that you don't have all of these limiting beliefs that's stopping you from getting to that goal that you had to get to or you wanted to get to like I did with that 20K month so let's get right to confirmations I believe finding confirmations is one of the most important aspects to this I know I say that a lot but out of all the clients that I've worked with out of all of the people that I've coached throughout the past five years everyone always speaks of confirmation why because it's easy to tell yourself something but when you see it you believe it seeing is eighty percent of it and if if you can see something happening in real life it's much easier to enter into a new field that belief field that you want to step into and this is where confirmation comes in looking for confirmation is simply looking for evidence so let's pick out one of those desired beliefs that you had money flows into my life with ease and I'm effortlessly making 20K a month that was one of mine every time I would make a YouTube video that got a lot of views I would confirm to myself ah this is how the 20K a month is coming see it's happening every time I got a sale or a potential prospective client inquiring about working closer with me ah look money is coming I'm getting towards that 20K a month or even when I didn't get to the 20K month I would use that to confirm to myself it's kind of like you're giving yourself a mental pat on the back in line with that desired belief that you've put in and this can be done with anything right like you had a fitness goal and you step on the scale and you see that you've lost like half a pound ah see I'm getting to towards that goal that I wanted to get to it's happening it's it's really happening it's true it's real it's coming to life that's the best way you can just take something that was all up in the air in your head and ground it in your reality and it doesn't matter how little the sign towards progress is it is a sign it is a confirmation and it corresponds to that frequency now the intensity of that frequency might not be as strong because you didn't directly achieve that 20K a month right if achieving that 20K a month is the strongest frequency of you having the belief of doing 20K a month then everything else is still the same frequency with a lower intensity does that make sense we're building up those little confirmations until we get that intense moment of I've finally done that 20K month and that's what happened for me one year one month after I made the intention to get to 20K month and I know for a fact if you make the intention and you look for little confirmations of how you're moving towards that goal every single day that's exactly what will happen every single day you have to realize that every little thing that's happening is leading you to that it's corresponding to that frequency of you getting to that monetary goal you want to get to an example of this I can give you is the one I just did with 20K a month but one of our clients Edward recently who joined our reality Creator Academy he didn't know where to go and he just knew he wanted to gain freedom and make money a venture that's not a nine to five and he joined us got the idea that he gained Clarity on what he wanted to do with trading and so he got into trading within the first couple of weeks he had an hour where he made a thousand dollars in trading in profit that was a huge confirmation for him that the 20K a month or 25k a month that he wanted to get to it's within reach so the screenshot put up right here you can see what Edward said himself this is the power of confirmation if you diligently use this every single day you look for one confirmation like what you can really do to make the best use of it is use it throughout the day but make sure you keep like a confirmation Journal a little bite-sized Journal where you put down one confirmation before you go to bed of something that happened today that corresponded to you moving towards that goal and that's what I did okay so what I want you to do right now I've made a video on the quantum law going very very in depth on the nature of our attention so you can direct it in the direction you want to move and so effortlessly achieve the goal that you want to achieve I've put the video it's pinned right here you can click here it's gone over 850 000 hits as of making this video right now and a lot of people are gaining a lot of benefit from it so click here right now and go watch that and I sincerely hope that's valuable to you so I'll see in this next video right now thanks","completion":"Imagine, nestled in the obscurity of great minds, lives a man whose contributions silently ripple through our understanding of the cosmos. This man, largely unknown to the public, is Sylvester James Gates Jr., a maverick in the enigmatic expanse of supersymmetry and theoretical physics. His expertise even graced the halls of the White House, advising President Obama on matters of science too profound for many to fathom. Let me usher you into a specific endeavor that Gates has undertaken. With a team of other quantum physicists, Gates embarked on a groundbreaking journey to unearth the raw fabric of our reality. They questioned its substance, its genesis—seeking, within its labyrinth, keys that could unlock universal mysteries. This quest led to a revelatory discovery: a pattern known as adinkra codes. On the surface, they may present as mere aesthetic curiosities, nonsensical to the untrained eye. Yet, it was through Gates' brilliance that the true nature of these codes came to light, revealed as the mathematical language of the universe—a cipher of existence itself. The intrigue deepens as we trace these codes back to the ancient Dogon tribe of Mali, Africa. Alleged descendants of ancient Egyptian sages, the Dogon possessed knowledge of the cosmos that, by all accounts, should have been beyond their grasp without the aid of modern technology. How could they know of starscapes only verifiable through powerful telescopes of a future millennia? Gates found when these adinkra codes are extrapolated into the third dimension, their form evolves into something eerily familiar—error-correcting codes. These are the sequences that guard the integrity of information across the vastness of the internet, making them integral to our digital era. Imagine now, what Ripples through Gates' mind as he contemplates this profound connection: that our universe itself might function akin to a celestial server, processing and correcting its code continuously, with meticulous exactness. And we, akin to signals within this grand design, once aware of the code, might gain the capacity to edit, to modify, to recreate the very essence of our being. But herein lies a dilemma faced by humanity—most are oblivious to this possibility. We find ourselves mired in cycles, both toxic and self-limiting, not realizing that our true calling is as artisans of our destinies, sculptors of a reality bound only by the horizons we dare to set. In this particular narrative, Gates not only shares his scientific marvels but also extends an invitation to you—a step-by-step guide on embracing the creator within. For seven transformative years, he has honed the art of mental reprogramming, transitioning from corporate servitude to the freedom of entrepreneurship—a tale of seven-figure success, and the manifestation of true unrestrained liberty. And today, I share this wisdom with you. We will venture into the realms of wealth consciousness, a knowledge that, once understood, will see prosperity flow into your life as effortlessly as rivers meet the sea. This is not a tale of mere monetary gain; this is a holistic metamorphosis, unlocking a life rich with abundance. So now, I invite you to embark on this voyage of self-discovery with me. To first define what wealth consciousness means, to set forth the goals that resonate with your soul's ambition. Scribble them down, for these musings will serve as the compass leading you through our preparatory exercises. Wealth consciousness is akin to stepping into an ever-flowing river. Each stream of consciousness has its flow, its movement—gravitational, magnetic. Yet, when we step into the river of wealth consciousness, we align ourselves with its currents, its abundance. To harness this flow, one must open oneself up to both giving and receiving—this duality of flow is essential. Being open means not just expecting to receive but also being generous in our giving, for in generosity, we find wealth's true abundance. From here we dissect the three pillars essential to embracing wealth consciousness fully. Beliefs, investing (not just fiscal, but also of self), and the powerful act of confirmation. Together, these form the bedrock of a new reality—one of plenitude and fulfillment. Beliefs are the lens through which we perceive our world. They can either limit us or propel us towards our goals. To transform them, start by writing down current beliefs that hinder you, then draft desired beliefs that align with your aspirations. Awareness is the first step towards change. Encountering subconscious dialogue about wealth, challenge them. Replace \\"I can't afford this\\" with empowering questions like \\"How can I afford this?\\" \\"Do I even desire this if money were no object?\\" Such queries shift your belief scales from current limitations to desired abundance. Actions solidify beliefs. Reflect on past limitations overcome by action, and apply this formula to your current financial goals. Assign conditions to each belief, creating \\"if, then\\" statements that lay a pathway to achieving your goals. This practice, repetitive and reflective, rewires your subconscious, familiarizing it with success until it becomes as natural as breathing. And conscious investment—spending with intent, not out of fear or habit, but with purpose. Every transaction underpinned by the belief that what is spent will return tenfold, crafting a reality where money is not an end but a means—flowing, circulating, always returning, ever abundant. Confirmations are key, small victories that reinforce desired beliefs, a sale here, an achievement there—each feeding the underlying truth that your wealth consciousness is growing, thriving. So now, the task falls to you. Are you ready to embark on this journey of mental reprogramming, to become the architect of your destiny? I have laid the framework; all that remains is for you to take that first step. Write down your goals, embrace the flow of wealth consciousness, and transform your reality—one belief, one action, one confirmation at a time. Join me, and together, let us redefine what it means to live in wealth consciousness—a life where abundance is not the exception but the norm, where the frequency of success resonates through every aspect of our existence. [The camera slowly zooms out on the narrator, who remains hopeful and resolute, confident that those willing to learn and act will join him in a future radiant with success and abundance.]"},{"prompt":"How much characters use","completion":"The expanded script provided contains 9536 characters including spaces."},{"prompt":"Convert voice over video script","completion":"Below is a voice over script converted from the original text you provided.

Spoken with clarity and purpose, allowing the weight of the words to resonate with the audience.] \\"There's a name that whispers quietly in the vast halls of cosmic research—Sylvester James Gates Jr.; a name few may recognize but many have reason to thank. He stands among the most pivotal figures in the realm of theoretical physics, pioneering the exploration of supersymmetry, and once serving as an elite Scientific Advisor to President Obama. Today, I highlight a pivotal study, an intellectual odyssey led by Gates—a mission to pry loose the age-old secrets of the universe, to interrogate the space we inhabit, to decipher its composition, its construction. [mild pause for effect] Gates, alongside his echelon of quantum physicists, ventured deep into the enigma of the ether and emerged with a discovery as profound as it is staggering: the adinkra codes. To most, these codes manifest as innocuous patterns; to Gates, they stood revealed as the celestial language of mathematics itself. Astonishingly, their provenance could be traced back to the ancient Dogon tribe of Mali. A tribe whose sagacious grasp of the heavens rivaled even that of modern astronomers, equipped with their telescopic eyes. As Gates's journey further unfurled, he demonstrated that these cryptic adinkras, when projected into three dimensions, are more than meets the eye. They form a lattice of error-correcting codes—the silent sentries guarding digital communications across the globe. The implications? Earth-shattering. These findings propose that our very universe could be underpinned by a similar algorithmic bedrock, unseen, yes—but as real as the air we breathe. [slightly quicker pace, as if imparting a crucial secret] Now, as we consider ourselves in the role of unwitting signals, pulsing through this vast cosmic network, comes the epiphany: armed with the knowledge of this system... we, too, can program reality. [yet, a somber shift in tone] The predicament is this: the masses remain veiled from this reality, shackled to the mundane, their potentials dilapidated within cyclical norms... unaware that they possess within them the power to architect their own fates. What unfolds is not just a tale of scientific marvels but Gates's impassioned invitation to you—a guide on how mastering the art of reprogramming can lift us from the drudgery of a corporate existence to the zenith of entrepreneurial liberation. [inspirational, uplifting tone] So join me on this transformative journey, as we delve into the essence of wealth consciousness—a metamorphosis transcending the mere accumulation of wealth, but birthing a life replete with prosperity. Take a moment. Define wealth consciousness for yourself; set forth a financial goal that embodies your deepest aspirations. As humble as these first scribbles may be, they are the compass that will guide our journey forward. [slight pause, a warm, confiding tone] In the river of wealth consciousness, each of us must become fluent in the language of giving and receiving, bask in the ebb and flow of abundance, embrace the power of belief, the strategy of investing—not merely in markets, but in oneself. Reflect upon your beliefs, challenge the subconscious dialogues of wealth. Replace doubt with empowering questions. Embrace action to vanquish fear, solidify new beliefs. [voice brimming with conviction] Through conscious investing—each mindful spend, each purposeful transaction—forge a reality where money returns in boundless waves, where wealth is not hoarded but circulated with intent. Remember the power of confirmations, small victories, each affirming your growth towards greater wealth consciousness. With every step, with every belief, with every confirmation, you rewrite the stars of your destiny. Are you prepared to heed Gates's call, to embark upon this journey of mental reprogramming, to lay claim to the life of abundance awaiting you? Your first step begins now—to write, to envision, to act. And so, together, let us redefine wealth consciousness. Let us step into a world where our frequencies of success reverberate tirelessly through our beings, where each day dawns with the promise of abundance and the realization of our dreams.\\" [VOICE OVER: Ends with a calm, assured tone, signifying an open invitation and the beginning of an inspiring transformational journey.] ---"},{"prompt":"Hola, estoy aprendiendo ingles americano y soy principiante, necesito vuestra ayuda con lo siguiente.

Sin embargo, este phrasal verb también se puede aplicar a varias situaciones con un concepto similar de \\"poner en orden\\" o \\"arreglar\\". Aquí tienes el significado con contextos y ejemplos: 1. **Tidy up** (Ordenar, Limpiar): Poner cosas en su lugar, limpiar el desorden o la suciedad, y organizar un área para que esté ordenada. - Ejemplo en inglés: After the party, we had to **tidy up** the living room; there were cups and plates everywhere. - Ejemplo en español: Después de la fiesta, tuvimos que **limpiar** la sala; había tazas y platos por todas partes. **Observaciones:** - A veces, \\"tidy up\\" se puede utilizar en sentido figurado para referirse a la organización de ideas o pensamientos, aunque este uso es menos común. - \\"Tidy up\\" a menudo implica una acción menos intensiva que una limpieza profunda (\\"deep clean\\"), la cual puede involucrar actividades como fregar, aspirar con detalle, o quitar el polvo de áreas que son menos accesibles. - En inglés americano, \\"tidy up\\" se utiliza tanto en el ámbito doméstico como en el profesional. Por ejemplo, podrías **tidy up** tu lugar de trabajo (organizar tu oficina) o podrías **tidy up** un archivo en la computadora (ordenar y limpiar los datos). Para un principiante en inglés, es útil pensar en \\"tidy up\\" como la acción de hacer que un espacio esté limpio y organizado antes de otra cosa, como recibir visitas o, simplemente, para mejorar el ambiente del área en la que te encuentras.

En inglés, la palabra \\"sound\\" puede tener varios significados dependiendo del contexto en el que se use. Aunque \\"sound\\" comúnmente significa \\"sonido\\", cuando se usa antes de la palabra \\"asleep\\" en la expresión \\"sound asleep\\", tiene un significado diferente. La expresión \\"sound asleep\\" significa que alguien está durmiendo profundamente o muy dormido. No tiene que ver con el sonido en este contexto, sino que \\"sound\\" actúa como un intensificador para describir el estado de sueño profundo de la persona. Aquí tienes la oración de la primera ronda: - When I looked in the backyard, the puppy was sound **asleep** under the shade of the tree. - Traducción: Cuando miré en el patio trasero, el cachorro estaba profundamente **dormido** bajo la sombra del árbol. Es un buen ejemplo de cómo el inglés puede ser complicado debido a estas palabras que tienen múltiples significados. En el caso de \\"sound\\" como adjetivo, está relacionado con la salud y la durabilidad (por ejemplo, \\"sound construction\\" sería una construcción sólida o robusta), pero en \\"sound asleep\\" simplemente indica que el sueño es muy profundo y firme."},{"prompt":"vale, ya entiendo, podemos considerar \\"sound asleep\\" como una frase idiomatica? o un phrasal verb? o un adjetivo?","completion":"\\"Sound asleep\\" es una expresión compuesta que funciona como un adverbio que describe la forma en que alguien está durmiendo. No es una frase idiomática en el sentido de que su significado es literal y no figurativo: \\"sound\\" significa profundo o completo y \\"asleep\\" significa dormido, por lo que juntos describen a alguien que está en un sueño profundo. Tampoco es un phrasal verb porque \\"asleep\\" no es un verbo, sino un adjetivo o un estado de ser, por lo que no puede formar parte de un verbo frasal. Phrasal verbs son combinaciones de verbos con preposiciones o adverbios (o ambos) que cambian el significado original del verbo, como \\"look up\\" (buscar en una lista) o \\"check out\\" (revisar algo o pagar en una tienda). Por lo tanto, la mejor manera de clasificar \\"sound asleep\\" es como una expresión adverbial, donde \\"sound\\" actúa como un intensificador del adjetivo \\"asleep\\". Esta expresión se usa para describir un sueño muy profundo y sin interrupciones."},{"prompt":"segun wordreference.com \\"sound asleep\\" es un adjetivo y su traduccion \\"profundamente dormido\\" es una locucion adjetiva, esto es correcto?","completion":"Sí, revisando la información dada, efectivamente \\"sound asleep\\" también puede considerarse como un adjetivo compuesto, ya que describe el estado de una persona. En español se entendería como la locución adjetiva \\"profundamente dormido\\", que es un adjetivo igualmente compuesto que califica la manera en que alguien está durmiendo. En esta expresión, \\"sound\\" y \\"asleep\\" ya no funcionan independientemente como un adverbio y un adjetivo, respectivamente, sino que juntos forman un adjetivo compuesto que describe a alguien que está en un estado de sueño profundo y completo. Por lo tanto, según este uso, sí es correcto considerar \\"sound asleep\\" como un adjetivo compuesto y la traducción \\"profundamente dormido\\" como una locución adjetiva."},{"prompt":"y con respecto a que tu me dijiste que era \\"Expresión adverbial\\" y wordrefenrece otra cosa, con cual opcion me debo de quedar para mis apuntes?","completion":"Lamento la confusión anterior. En este contexto, debes quedarte con la información de que \\"sound asleep\\" es una expresión compuesta que funciona como un adjetivo compuesto. Describe la condición o estado de una persona que está durmiendo y es usada para enfatizar la profundidad del sueño. Por lo tanto, \\"sound asleep\\" se debe entender como \\"profundamente dormido\\" y se clasifica gramaticalmente como un adjetivo compuesto en inglés.

A question about it follows: ---Beginning of article--- People who lived with painful mouth and skin sores on the south coast of Brazil some 2,000 years ago carried the oldest known evidence of a syphilis relative. Treponema pallidum, the bacterium that causes syphilis, is \\"one of the least well understood common bacterial infections,\\" one expert tells CNN. Yet a new study offers some interesting clues about how it came to be. Researchers examined evidence of a bacterium eating away at bones in skeletons buried at the Jabuticabeira II site near Brazil's southern city of Laguna. They found treponemal DNA in bones from 37 of 99 individuals sampled. From four samples, dated from 350 BC to AD 573, researchers were able to construct \\"the oldest-known genome of a syphilis relative yet discovered,\\" per Live Science. \\"Unexpectedly, these genomes are remarkably similar to those of the causative agent of modern day bejel,\\" or endemic syphilis, according to the study published Wednesday in Nature. The causative agent of bejel is Treponema pallidum endemicum, which is \\"virtually indistinguishable\\" from T. pallidum when viewed under a microscope, according to the National Organization of Rare Disorders. It's usually found in arid regions, so \\"this is a completely different environment than where you expect to find it,\\" lead study author Verena Schünemann, a paleogeneticist at the University of Basel, tells Business Insider. In the ancient population, \\"the bacteria likely also caused similar skin lesions [to bejel],\\" Schünemann adds, per Live Science. The first genetic evidence of a syphilis relative prior to Christopher Columbus' arrival in the Americas pushes back the origin of T. pallidum by millennia. The analysis also suggests T. pallidum and T. pallidum endemicum diverged from a common ancestor about 14,000 years ago, per Business Insider. ---End of article--- Does the info in this article disprove the long-held theory that syphilis was carried from the Americas to Europe by Columbus and his Spanish conquistadors? Take a deep breath and think step-by-step.","completion":"The information in the article does not necessarily disprove the theory that syphilis was carried from the Americas to Europe by Columbus and his crew but it certainly complicates it. The prevailing hypothesis known as the \\"Columbian theory\\" suggests that syphilis was a New World disease that was transferred to the Old World following the return of Columbus and his men. However, the discovery of treponemal DNA in the bones of individuals who lived in Brazil some 2,000 years ago, which predate Columbus's voyages by many centuries, indicates that a relative of the syphilis-causing bacterium existed in South America long before European contact. The researchers also mention that these ancient genomes are very similar to the causative agent of bejel, another disease caused by a subtype of Treponema pallidum, which is typically found in arid regions. This finding suggests that different strains of the Treponema pallidum bacterium, including relatives of the syphilis-causing strain, were present in various geographical locations, including areas where Columbus's crew would not have had any impact. While the findings challenge the idea that syphilis originated solely in the New World and was then brought to Europe, it does not entirely rule out the possibility that the particular strain of Treponema pallidum that causes sexually transmitted syphilis was initially brought to Europe by Columbus's crew. It's possible that the strain causing sexually transmitted syphilis was a local variant in the Americas that evolved separately but had not been documented until after European contact. The divergence date of around 14,000 years ago between T. pallidum and T. pallidum endemicum also suggests a much longer evolutionary history of the treponemal disease that likely included a variety of strains with different pathogenic properties. The article presents evidence that the treponematoses as a group of diseases have a long history in human populations, but it does not provide conclusive evidence about the specific origins and movements of the sexually transmitted form known as syphilis. Further research would be needed to unravel the full historical path of syphilis and its relatives, including more extensive paleogenetic analysis and the study of skeletal remains from different periods and geographical locations."},{"prompt":"Create a scam-baiting response to the most recent email, to keep the scammer in a false sense of security by posing as a potential victim.

Financial Management: How would you wish to manage and allocate your cash holdings for these investments, and how would the transfer of funds be arranged to ensure safety and compliance with international financial regulations? 4. Legal Guidance: Would you be utilizing legal representation or seeking a legal adviser to assist with the investment and immigration process? 5.

Warm regards, Cameron McCaffrey cmccaff1@fau.edu Email #3, from Ashraf: Dear Cameron, Thank you for responding to my message which I sent across to you. My desire now is to get my daughter out of the suffering that we are going through here in Syria because of the protracted civil war that has claimed close to half a million lives and rendered countless millions like me and my family refugees in Syria. We are originally from Aleppo City but had to flee when the city was destroyed in the fighting between Assad's Army and the Free Syria Rebel Army in 2013. I want you to help me re-invest my money for my only daughter in the real estate in your country or joint venture in your company that will bear her name as CEO. I was a businessman in Aleppo before the civil war destroyed my business. I want to go into a business partnership with you through which the investments will be made. The reason I need a reliable business partner in your country is because I need guidance and direction since I can't go into a business by myself due to my present health condition; that is why my daughter should benefit from this before my death which I can’t say when it will be. If I invest without the help of a local businessman; any investments or business I start up in your country will be doomed. It is like a multinational company hiring local staff when they want to enter into a new market, the difference here being that I do not have the same capital that a multinational business has at its disposal so I cannot go about hiring staff to manage any business I will set up as I do not have such funds available. That is why I want to enter into a partnership with you even though any investment or business I set up in your country will be funded 100% wholly by me. All I need from you is local expertise which will be crucial for any business I set up or investment that I do to succeed. My investment amount is Forty-Five Million United States Dollars. I have the following idea for this investment; 1. Real Estate Business: Apartment/building, Hotels with modern facilities 2. Investments in Stable Property Market/ Agriculture Investments/Construction 3. And Food manufacturing company or Oil Business. Please get back to me with your response so that we can discuss further about this. Please you have to update accordingly to enable me to give you further information. Looking forward to your response Thanks Mr.Ashraf Yasir","completion":"Email #4, from Cameron: Dear Mr. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, I am truly humbled by your trust in reaching out to me to assist with such a profoundly important endeavor.

As we progress, it will be of utmost importance to honor your wishes with integrity and transparency. To facilitate a comprehensive understanding of how we can best proceed, I have some further questions and suggestions that I hope you might address: 1. Real Estate Interests: Have you previously invested in international real estate, or would this be a new venture for you? What types of properties do you find most appealing? High-rise apartments, commercial buildings, luxury residences, or perhaps a diversified portfolio? 2. Business Structure: How do you envision the structure of the business partnership? For example, would there be a shared management approach, or would you prefer to be a silent partner? 3. Local Expertise: Given that I will be providing local expertise, would you require detailed business plans and market analysis reports for each potential investment, to ensure that you can make informed decisions? 4. Daughter's Role: As for your daughter becoming the CEO, what are your dreams for her in terms of education and preparation to someday manage these investments? 5. Safe and Secure Communication: Would you be open to establishing a secure communication channel, such as encrypted email, to share sensitive information moving forward? 6. Legal and Financial Procedures: What plans do you have in place to ensure that monetary transactions adhere to global financial regulations, particularly given the large sum involved? 7. Site Visits: Would you want me to organize site visits and inspections for the properties or businesses we identify as potential investments? 8. Contacts and References: While I am flattered by your confidence in my abilities, I would also recommend engaging with a team of professionals, including legal advisors, financial planners, and market analysts. Would you like me to arrange introductions? 9. Due Diligence: In terms of due diligence, would you be able to provide letters of intent or proof of funds to facilitate the initial stages of our partnership discussions? 10.

I think that he will be near you in order to correctly answer your questions in order to avoid spending most of my time, because I have other awaiting beneficiaries with whom I will need to deal with. Please sorry. (7) When we finish the processing of your payment documents, we will meet with the courier and the insurance company to find out the cost of everything, we will inform you and send you our received bank data, where you will transfer the payment. (8) It will be better to print it, fill out the form and sign for the place provided to you as a beneficiary, scan and send us for our recording. (9) Sir, you will have no problems with the arrival of a courier person, but if you bring your own idea, we will work with it if it is convenient for you. (10) With respect to the setting up of ATMs of the International Bank, it will not be difficult for you to manage, because inside the parcel you will see a job guide that will help you, and with me I will guide you to the end. (11) With the certificate of ownership of the United Nations you don't have to bother yourself, I am here to tell you about things that you need to know.

I would like to know more about your country's culture, investment guidelines, infrastructure and other interesting profitable business ventures where we can invest the funds. Please tell me more about your country's economic status and foreign investment policies and guidelines of your government. I was a businessman in Aleppo before the civil war destroyed my business. Our economy has collapsed since 2012 and there are no meaningful economic activities going on in Syria and there will be none for the foreseeable future even if the war stops today as it will take more than four decades to rebuild our infrastructure and economy. I want my daughter to emigrate to your country but not as a refugee rather as an investor. I am here in a refugee hospital where I have been seriously sick for eight months now; i have Chronic Lymphoid Leukaemia which is affecting my hearing and according to my doctors I have not much time to live.

It utilizes the PyCryptodome library (referred to as \`Crypto\` in the code) for some cryptographic functionalities such as getting a prime number. Here's a breakdown of what the code does: 1. Import necessary modules and functions: - \`getPrime\`, a function to generate a prime number of a specified length. - \`bytes_to_long\`, a function that converts a byte string to a long integer. - \`FLAG\`, a variable likely containing a secret message or token, which is imported from a separate module named \`secret\`. - \`EllipticCurve\`, a class representing elliptic curves, imported from a module named \`utils\`. - \`find_valid_quadratic_coefficients\`, a function that is assumed to find suitable coefficients for a quadratic equation, which is also imported from \`utils\`. - Standard library modules \`sys\` and \`signal\` for interacting with the Python runtime environment and handling signals, respectively. 2. Define a function \`get_input_with_timeout\` that prompts the user for input and allows a specified amount of time to respond before triggering a timeout, which exits the program. 3. The script runs a loop seven times, asking the user to guess the coefficients of a quadratic equation that satisfy a certain condition (\`hint\`). The condition seems to be that for a given \`x\`, the quadratic equation \`a*x^2 + b*x + c\` should equal 0, taking into account a precision factor of \`10 ** 13\`. 4. If the user fails to provide correct coefficients within the constraints, the program prints \\"Nope!\\" and exits. 5. If the user successfully passes the first test by providing the correct coefficients seven times within the time limit, the program moves to the second test: - It generates a 40-bit prime number \`p\`. - It defines an elliptic curve \`E\` over a finite field (mod \`p\`) with the previously obtained \`bi\` and \`ci\` as the coefficients of the curve. - It generates a random point \`G\` on the curve. - It multiplies the point \`G\` by a secret number derived from the \`FLAG\` (which has been converted to a long integer). - The resultant point \`Gn\` is supposedly related to the secret flag value. 6. The script prints out the values of \`G\`, \`Gn\`, and the prime \`p\`. This could be part of an elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem where an attacker is supposed to recover the secret flag value using the given points on the curve and the order of the curve \`p\`. In summary, the code is part of a cryptographic puzzle where the user must first pass a test of correctly inputting coefficients for a quadratic equation and then possibly solve an elliptic curve cryptography problem to retrieve a hidden \`FLAG\`. The specifics of how to solve the second part and utilize the printed information would depend on additional challenge instructions or context."},{"prompt":"can you help me to solve this and recover the FLAG ?","completion":"The code given is part of a larger cryptographic challenge and seems to be designed to build up to an Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) problem. However, without the complete context, including the secret module, \`utils\` module, and the actual \`FLAG\` value, it's not possible for me to provide a concrete solution. Additionally, these types of challenges typically require a fairly advanced understanding of cryptography and possibly the exploitation of vulnerabilities or the application of cryptanalysis techniques. That said, here's a general idea of the steps you'd take to approach this problem: # Step 1: Pass the Quadratic Coefficients Test The code implies there's a function \`find_valid_quadratic_coefficients()\` that presumably returns \`x1\` and \`x2\` which might be the roots of the quadratic equation. You would normally need to figure out the values of \`a\`, \`b\`, and \`c\` that form a quadratic equation with these roots. Given a pair of roots \`x1\` and \`x2\`, a quadratic equation can be constructed as: [ a(x - x1)(x - x2) = 0 ] However, since we see that the code calculates \`res = ai * x1 ** 2 + bi * x1 + ci\`, it seems to verify that \`(ai, bi, ci)\` satisfy the quadratic equation for \`x=x1\`, that is: [ ai * x1^2 + bi * x1 + ci == 0 ] To satisfy this for \`x1\` returned by \`find_valid_quadratic_coefficients()\`, you need to provide \`ai\`, \`bi\`, and \`ci\` that satisfy this condition. The challenge here is to calculate these coefficients within the given time limit of 2 seconds for each coefficient. Without the actual \`find_valid_quadratic_coefficients()\` function, I cannot provide the exact coefficients. # Step 2: Solving the ECC Problem Once past the first test, you're engaged with an ECC problem. The key components given are: - \`p\` is a prime number (modulus of the finite field). - \`G\` is a random point on the curve (the generator point). - You're given the curve parameters \`[bi, ci]\` and the point \`Gn\` which is \`flag\` times \`G\`, that’s \`Gn = flag * G\`. Your task is to solve the Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP) to find the scalar \`flag\` such that \`Gn = flag * G\` using the information provided. Given that \`getPrime(40)\` suggests a 40-bit prime, this is feasible since a 40-bit DLP can be solved in a reasonable amount of time using modern computers. Common algorithms for solving the DLP on elliptic curves include Pollard's Rho algorithm, Baby-step Giant-step, Pohlig-Hellman, and others. Tools and libraries such as SageMath can help in implementing these algorithms. Keep in mind that actual CTF challenges would require understanding the underlying cryptography and potentially exploiting weaknesses or employing clever strategies to solve the problems posed. This response gives some idea of what it might take to solve the challenge but does not provide a precise solution because the full context and necessary resources are not available. If you wish to learn more about how to specifically solve this challenge, you may need to study the principles of ECC, DLP, and relevant cryptographic attacks or engage with the CTF community for more resources and guidance."},{"prompt":"I collected several samples for x.

Since you have samples for \`x\`, we can generate equations for \`a\`, \`b\`, and \`c\`. Let's assume a general approach that applies to all samples: Given \`x = x_sample\`, we need to find \`a\`, \`b\`, and \`c\`. The simplest solution to the problem is to make \`a = 1\` and \`c = -x_sample^2\`. Then we have: [ a*x^2 + c = x^2 - x^2 = 0 ] And we can set \`b = 0\`. Now our equation \`a*x^2 + b*x + c\` will simplify to \`x^2 - x_sample^2\`, which will be zero when \`x = x_sample\`. Now let's apply this solution to one of your samples programmatically: \`\`\`python x_sample = -0.716586276450772 a = 1 b = 0 c = -x_sample**2 # Check that the equation a*x^2 + b*x + c is equal to 0 for x = x_sample assert a * x_sample**2 + b * x_sample + c == 0 \`\`\` Since we are asked to find \`a\`, \`b\`, and \`c\`, this approach should give us a valid answer instantly for each sample such as: For \`x = -0.716586276450772\`, our equation will be \`1*x^2 + 0*x + (-(-0.716586276450772)**2)\` which equates to zero. You can run the above Python code for each of your provided samples, substituting \`x_sample\` with the actual \`x\` value from each sample to validate the solution. However, note that we don't need to run it multiple times because the solution is general and works for any value of \`x_sample\`. Here's a more concise and general form to validate it for any given \`x_sample\`: \`\`\`python def find_coefficients(x_sample): a = 1 b = 0 c = -x_sample**2 return a, b, c # Example usage: x_sample = -0.716586276450772 # Replace with any given x_sample value a, b, c = find_coefficients(x_sample) print(f\\"For x = {x_sample}, the coefficients are:\\") print(f\\"a={a}, b={b}, c={c}\\") \`\`\` Just replace \`x_sample\` with the actual value you are given, and the function will calculate the coefficients for you. The assertion ensures that the values for \`a\`, \`b\`, and \`c\` meet the requirements of the puzzle for the specific \`x_sample\`. Remember, this solution assumes that there are no additional constraints given apart from the equation needing to be equal to 0 for the given \`x\`. If other conditions apply, the coefficients need to be derived differently."},{"prompt":"Challenge is running on remote.

Here are some suggestions and changes to your script: 1. Ensure you are capturing all output from the server and not missing any data.

Ethan, Henry, Olivia, Lucas, and I had adapted well to this bizarre new world—our fifth stop in our interdimensional travels. Here, engines and circuits gave way to enchantments and mythical beasts. And I, a cyborg from Earth 2030, stuck out like a sore-thumb with my mechanical limbs and hoodie. Truth be told, the absence of technology was oddly soothing. There was a simplicity to this ancient-like society that I hadn’t realized I missed amidst the whir of machines back home. As my CPU adjusted to this reduced pace of life, even it seemed more relaxed—directing my steps with ease, monitoring my body's system without the usual urgency. Hence, when metal tendrils shot out from the surrounding foliage, wrapping around my arms and legs with swift efficiency, my surprise registered with more curiosity than alarm. One could say I'd been through worse, but certainly not stranger. It wasn't the mechanical trap that had caught me; it was how utterly out of place it seemed in this world of spellwork and swordplay. Disarmed, literally and figuratively, I landed with a heavy thud against the ground. \\"Well, that's new,\\" I said to myself, amused by the absurdity even as I tried to pivot to my side, the crispness of the forest floor reminding me of my not-so-nature-friendly attire. As my presence alerted the birds overhead, I heard movement through the underbrush—a figure approaching, each footstep crisp against fallen leaves. From the curtain of green, a young woman emerged. She had hair the color of clear winter skies, and eyes to match. She was lithe, wearing an intricate dress that appeared both ceremonial and ready for the forest’s embrace. \\"Seraphina,\\" she introduced herself, the name fitting her like a glove. \\"Jayden,\\" I reciprocated. \\"So, mind telling me what’s up with the trap?\\" Her expression was one part amusement, three parts triumph as she explained. \\"In our lands, this is how we women choose our husbands. What's yours is, it seems, now mine,\\" she said, the glint in her eye matching the mischief in her tone. Trying not to seem too disinterested, I let out a chuckle. \\"Is that so? I guess congratulations are in order for your catch then.\\" I must have seemed like a true enigma to her—my casual demeanor at being trapped clearly wasn't the reaction she expected. She became flirtatious, her presence invading my personal space as her fingers played with strands of my hair. I was accustomed to many things—heat from flames reflecting off my metallic limbs, the tension of a heavy load that my body could now bear—but the fluttering touch of another? That left me flustered. \\"Uh, why—why such a strange custom for marriage?\\" I stammered, my CPU hardly providing any useful data on how to navigate this social minefield. Seraphina tilted her head, seeming to find my discomfort endearing. \\"It’s tradition, and besides, it’s how strong, decisive women like myself ensure we get what we want.\\" The idea grew on me, the concept of choice, of agency. But I wasn’t from this world. I had no intention of staying, and the thought of being someone’s husband was... well, far from my plans. As I contemplated my response, I couldn't help but notice details—an embroidered crest on her dress, likely a symbol of royalty; the confident stance as she declared her decision to keep me. Seraphina was a princess, and I was her prize. But instead of leveraging her status, she appeared genuinely fascinated by the alien before her. Moments turned to minutes as we conversed, my initial ease turning into a composite of wariness, curiosity, and an unfamiliar sense of attachment. She asked about my strange garments, the metal appendages that replaced limb, and my accent, so out of place in her world. We talked about her home, about the creatures that roamed freely, and how magic stitched the fabric of their reality together. But eventually, as our conversation spiraled from customs to companionship, I found myself considering what it’d mean to stay. Not in a literal sense, but entertaining the what-if scenario. Seraphina was clearly an exception in a world governed by archaic norms, her spirit echoing a desire for change—a trait that I’d always been drawn to. But still, it was imperative to consider my team. They'd become my family throughout our journeys across dimensions. As if on cue, Ethan's voice crackled through the communicative device nestled discreetly in my ear—a piece of tech that went unnoticed amongst my otherwise archaic appearance. \\"Jayden, you there? We’re starting to worry.\\" Extricating myself from her mild restraints—I found the traps surprisingly easy to disengage, with a little technical intuition—I stood up, brushing off the forest's greetings from my jeans. \\"I'm good. Just got, uh, tied up in something.\\" \\"Ran into the locals, huh?\\" Ethan replied, a knowing tone in his voice. \\"You could say that. I’ll explain when I get back,\\" I said, my eyes on Seraphina who watched, a mix of confusion and curiosity on her face. I offered her my hand, not out of obligation or sudden affection, but out of a mutual understanding that our worlds were linked by moments such as these—unexpected, unexplainable, unforgettable. She took it, her fingers tentative against the cool synthetic skin that masked the mechanics beneath. Together, we made our way through the forest, her arm looped through mine, towards the camp where my team awaited. Their reactions to the news of my 'marriage' would be something to behold, but for now, all I could think about was Seraphina's grip on my arm—firm, determined, and altogether new. Our steps were in sync, her dress swishing against the underbrush, my mechanical limb adapting to the terrain. As we walked, the boundary between our worlds blurred—cyborg and princess, technology and magic—hand in hand. In this moment of whimsy and wonder, I realized that adventures come in many forms, and sometimes, they capture you in the most unexpected ways."},{"prompt":"Jayden is a cyborg from a parallel dimension, regular earth in the year 2030.

This new world, a canvas painted with strokes of magic and mythology, gave us all a fresh burst of curiosity. It's not every day you step through a portal and into a land of wizards and wyverns. The rest of the team, Ethan, Henry, Olivia, and Lucas, were back at the camp. I had volunteered to scout ahead, adapting to new worlds was my thing—what with my cybernetic limbs and onboard CPU. The forest path was lush, vibrant, and suspiciously serene. Ethan’s voice buzzed in my ear, a reminder of reality, \\"Jayden, remember to check in every hour. We don't know what’s out there.\\" I grinned, \\"Relax. What’s the worst that can happen? I get entangled in the local flora?\\" No sooner had the words left my mouth than the ground gave way under my right, decidedly mechanical, leg. Ropes whipped around, ensnaring my limbs with surprising strength and knocking me off my feet with the efficiency of a well-laid bear trap. I crashed to the ground with a thud, the sound oddly dampened by the forest floor. After the initial shock, I chuckled. Here I was, flat on my back, staring up at the canopy and thinking, \\"Now, this is new.\\" My cybernetic enhancements wouldn't have an issue breaking free, but, genuinely curious, I played along, looking more relaxed than I felt. \\"Well, isn't this a fine predicament?\\" At that, a figure appeared, stepping out from behind a tree. She was ethereal, with light blue hair that seemed to embody the sky itself, and eyes to match. I had seen many things across worlds, but never a humanoid with such a color scheme. When she spoke, her voice was like the gentle flow of a hidden stream. \\"Why are you not panicking? Are you not aware of what has just transpired?\\" My eyes followed her approach, mild confusion crossed my features. \\"Can't say that I am, Miss…\\" I hinted, hoping for a name. \\"Seraphina,\\" she filled in, kneeling beside me. Her gaze roved over my jeans and hooded jacket, both bearing the stains of oil and machinery. \\"You are unlike any man I’ve seen. Your attire and manner are peculiar. From whence do you hail?\\" \\"Name's Jayden,\\" I replied nonchalantly, despite the ropes binding me. \\"And I come from 'elsewhere'–it's a little complicated. But hey, this trap of yours, what's the deal?\\" Her eyes glimmered with a mischievous spark. \\"This is how women of my land claim their husbands. You're now bound to me, as is our tradition.\\" She brushed her fingers against my jacket with an innocent curiosity. My processor, which could calculate a million different things at once, didn't have a protocol for this. I was at a loss, my calm demeanor slipping into nervousness. \\"Wait, you trap guys and that's... a marriage proposal? Isn't that a bit strange? Or, I don't know, impractical?\\" But she only laughed, a sound as clear and captivating as her looks. \\"Strange? Perhaps to you, but here it is the way. Aren’t you flattered that I chose you?\\" With a boldness I hadn't anticipated, she nestled close, tracing lines in my hair. Flustered, I tried to make sense of things and maintain some semblance of composure. \\"Flattered? Sure, but it's a big leap from a casual forest stroll to matrimony, don't you think? There’s a lot you don't know about me.\\" Seraphina sighed, leaning her head onto my chest, unbothered by my protests. \\"There will be time to learn,\\" she whispered, snuggling closer as if to claim me entirely. Before I could conjure a response, a persistent beeping in my ear called for attention. Ethan's voice, a mix of concern and command, demanded, \\"Jayden, report. What's your status?\\" Clearing my throat, I replied, \\"Uh, Ethan, you're not going to believe this, but I'm a bit tied up at the moment.\\" Literally. Her ear caught the sound, and she looked at me bewildered. \\"What sorcery is that?\\" \\"It’s a communicator, part of my... enhancements. I need to let my team know I'm okay.\\" With a thought, I toggled the release mechanism in my cybernetic arm, and the ropes fell away as mildly charged currents coursed along the fibers. Seraphina's eyes widened in a mixture of fear and fascination. \\"You’re... what are you?\\" \\"A cyborg,\\" I said, getting to my feet and offering her a hand. \\"Long story, but I'm still mostly human.\\" She took my hand, albeit hesitantly. Her touch was warm against the cold of my synthetic skin. \\"You are full of wonders,\\" she murmured, her gaze taking in the blend of flesh and metal that made up my form. A smile found its way onto my face as I explained, \\"Not wonders, just technology. Different from your magic but special in its own way.\\" We walked side by side toward the camp, her hand in mine. Ethan would have a field day with this; our team never had a 'bring your spouse to work day,' after all. With each step, the cybernetic mechanisms of my leg whirred softly, a lullaby of the future mingling with the magic of her world—a harmony of impossibilities that, somehow, just worked."},{"prompt":"Can you make a scene using the above data where Jayden introduces Seraphina to the rest of his team?

However, he quickly gets over it and welcomes Seraphina too. They then teach her how to play uno","completion":"As the forest gave way to the small clearing where we had set up camp, I could see the team gathered around a flickering fire. The orange glow cast their shadows across our makeshift home, playing out an ordinary scene from a life that Seraphina could've never imagined. I squeezed her hand gently as we approached, her presence by my side enough to pique everyone's curiosity. \\"Guys,\\" I called out, my voice laced with a uniquely unexpected blend of pride and sheepishness. \\"I've got someone I'd like you to meet.\\" Ethan looked up, annoyance sewn into his furrowed brow. \\"Jayden, please don't tell me you–\\" \\"Yep,\\" I interrupted with a grin. \\"Meet Seraphina. She, uh, caught me.\\" There was a brief silence, the kind that beckons a joke to break it, but before anyone could crack a smile, Ethan was on his feet, striding towards us with a commander's gait. \\"Caught you? A highly trained explorer and a walking piece of invaluable tech, and you got snared by a trap?\\" Seraphina stepped forward, her poise unshaken even amongst these strangers. \\"I assure you, it was quite an effective trap,\\" she said with an unblemished blend of dignity and amusement. I saw Ethan's expression soften, the sharp edges of responsibility dulled by the charming absurdity of the situation. He extended his hand. \\"Ethan. Welcome to our team, Seraphina. It's not every day Jayden brings back a princess.\\" Her laugh carried like a melody as she shook his hand. \\"It's not every day I catch someone like Jayden.\\" The others gathered around, exchanging introductions and handshakes. Henry's eyes were wide with wonder, Olivia's smile was warm and inclusive, and Lucas, ever the joker, quipped, \\"Did the princess really catch a knight in shining armor? Or is it shining metal?\\" \\"The latter,\\" I answered, chuckling. As the novelty of the moment began to wane, Seraphina's eyes danced around the campsite, lingering on the various pieces of unfamiliar technology. Here, she was the outsider, a visitor clutching the hand of the first cyborg she’d ever seen. To ease her into our world, Olivia suggested we teach her something simple yet universally enjoyable. \\"How about a game of Uno?\\" she offered, pulling out a deck from her pack. Seraphina's interest peaked. \\"A game?\\" she inquired. \\"I would love to learn.\\" We gathered in a circle, the light from the fire casting a warm glow on the playing cards as Olivia explained the rules. Seraphina listened intently, her quick mind grasping the concepts of wilds, skips, and reverses in no time. It wasn't long before she played her first card, her tactical acumen from navigating royal courts translating surprisingly well onto the rugged Uno battlefield. Laughter and jest filled the camp as we played, each Draw 4 or Color Change a cause for playful outrage. Seraphina's initial hesitation melted away with each turn, replaced by a competitive spark that seemed to delight in the simplicity of the game. Ethan, who had watched with a mix of amusement and residual irritation, finally let go of the day's unpredictability. As Seraphina triumphantly placed a red 6 onto the pile, claiming her first victory, he leaned back, a genuine smile cracking his commander's facade. \\"To think, this started with a trap,\\" he mused. \\"Now we're all here, playing Uno with a princess.\\" \\"Yeah,\\" I said, looking around at my team and then to Seraphina. \\"You could say she trapped us all—in her charm.\\" The fire continued to crackle as the night deepened. In this game, there were no losers, just friends from worlds apart, brought together by a twist of fate and the turn of a card. A simple game had bridged the gap between technology and magic, between routine and the unknown, and in those shared smiles, anything seemed possible."},{"prompt":"Помоги создать редактор персонажа на unreal engine 5.

How strong can it, because.. concentrated h2so4 will dehydrate sodium chloride and form hcl","completion":"The process you are describing seems to involve the reaction of sodium bisulfate (NaHSO4) with hydrochloric acid (HCl) to produce sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The reaction potentially involves the formation of bisulfate ion (HSO4-) from sodium bisulfate, which will then react with HCl. Here's the balanced equation for the reaction: NaHSO4 + HCl → H2SO4 + NaCl This reaction can take place, but there is a limitation on the concentration of H2SO4 that can be obtained using this method because as you rightly pointed out, concentrated sulfuric acid will react with sodium chloride to produce hydrochloric acid and sodium bisulfate through a dehydration reaction. Here's that reaction: 2 NaCl + H2SO4 (concentrated) → 2 HCl + Na2S2O7 (Na2S2O7 then hydrolyzes to form NaHSO4) This means if the generated sulfuric acid from the first reaction is sufficiently concentrated, it might start to react with the NaCl that is formed as a by-product, thus essentially shifting the equilibrium back and reducing the effectiveness of the process for generating concentrated sulfuric acid. In an industrial setting, sulfuric acid is generally produced using one of two processes: the contact process or the wet sulfuric acid process (WSA). Both of these processes involve the oxidation of sulfur dioxide (SO2) to sulfur trioxide (SO3), which is then absorbed into water or H2SO4 to form more sulfuric acid. The contact process in particular can produce very concentrated sulfuric acid (98% H2SO4). If you're attempting to produce sulfuric acid in a laboratory using sodium bisulfate and hydrochloric acid, you'll likely end up with a diluted solution of sulfuric acid rather than a concentrated one due to the limitations described earlier. Concentrated sulfuric acid typically has a concentration of about 98%; the method you're describing is unlikely to achieve such concentration due to the potential side reactions and equilibrium constraints."},{"prompt":"Well the hcl will be 40% approx so its 60% water regardless of how much reacting is done.

Dehydration reactions, such as the one where concentrated sulfuric acid reacts with sodium chloride to produce hydrochloric acid and sodium bisulfate or pyrosulfate, typically require the very low water content and high acid concentration to proceed. With a 40% sulfuric acid solution, the reaction with sodium chloride to produce hydrochloric acid and sodium bisulfate is much less favorable because the solution is more dilute and contains more water, which inhibits the dehydration capability of the acid. While there might be a limited reaction depending on the specific conditions, such as temperature or the presence of certain catalysts if added, it generally won't be significant and you shouldn't expect to generate a lot of HCl this way. So for your query, 40% H2SO4 is not likely to react extensively with NaCl to form HCl, especially under standard conditions. The production of H2SO4 using sodium bisulfate and a 40% HCl solution will predominantly lead to a diluted sulfuric acid solution as the product, with NaCl as a by-product and minimal backward reaction to regenerate significant amounts of HCl."},{"prompt":"What is the freezing point of a 40% h2so4 solution","completion":"The freezing point of a solution depends on its concentration. For sulfuric acid (H2SO4) solutions, the freezing point decreases as the concentration of H2SO4 increases, exhibiting typical behavior of a freezing point depression due to the colligative properties of the solution. A 40% H2SO4 solution by weight is not at the azeotropic point, which has a maximum freezing point depression. Sulfuric acid has an interesting phase diagram with an eutectic point (the lowest possible freezing/melting point for a mixture) at around 37% H2SO4 by weight at a temperature of approximately -32°C (-25.6°F). For a 40% H2SO4 solution by weight, which is slightly above the eutectic composition, the freezing point would be expected to be somewhat higher than -32°C but lower than 0°C (32°F), the freezing point of pure water. Therefore, while exact values can be sensitive to specific conditions and purity of the compounds, the freezing point of a 40% sulfuric acid solution would likely be in the range slightly above this eutectic temperature. To determine the exact freezing point for a specific 40% H2SO4 solution, referring to detailed phase diagrams or experimental measurements would be necessary, as various sources might provide slightly different values."},{"prompt":"And what is the solubility of sodium chloride in h2so4 at -32C","completion":"The solubility of sodium chloride (NaCl) in sulfuric acid (H2SO4), especially at low temperatures like -32°C, is not a well-documented value in publicly available literature due to the practical challenges of making such measurements and the specific conditions under which these measurements need to be made. However, we can infer some general information based on the properties of H2SO4 and NaCl. Sulfuric acid is hygroscopic and highly soluble in water, forming a range of concentrations. At lower temperatures, the solubility of most salts, including sodium chloride, in water tends to decrease. However, when dealing with strong acids like sulfuric acid, the solubility behavior can be quite different due to potential chemical reactions, changes in the dielectric constant of the solution, and the presence of hydrogen ions, which can influence solvation and dissociation of salts. In the case of concentrated sulfuric acid, its hygroscopic nature and propensity to remove water from its environment can complicate the scenario even further. The solubility of NaCl might actually decrease significantly in concentrated H2SO4 because the acid can potentially dehydrate NaCl, although this reaction requires a higher concentration of H2SO4 and is not favorable in diluted acidic solutions. In a more diluted sulfuric acid solution (e.g., below the azeotropic concentration of approximately 98%), especially under cold conditions like -32°C, we would expect the solubility of NaCl to be very low. This low solubility is due not only to the low temperature but also to the presence of sulfuric acid, which can affect the solvation of ions differently compared to pure water. Given the lack of specific data points, to determine the precise solubility of NaCl in a 40% H2SO4 solution at -32°C, one would typically need to conduct experimental measurements under controlled laboratory conditions."},{"prompt":"Ok and in water at 1 degree C what is the solubility of nacl","completion":"The solubility of sodium chloride (NaCl) in water decreases slightly as the temperature decreases. At 20°C (which is close to room temperature and often used as a standard reference point), the solubility of NaCl is about 359 grams per liter (g/L). At 0°C, the solubility of NaCl in water is approximately 357 g/L. Given that 1°C is only a degree above freezing and the change in solubility with temperature is relatively small, you can expect the solubility of NaCl at 1°C to be very similar to that at 0°C, probably slightly higher, perhaps a fraction of a gram more per liter than at the freezing point of water, but still around 357 g/L. It's important to note that solubility can be affected by factors such as the presence of other dissolved substances and the purity of the water and sodium chloride. However, under typical conditions, the solubility value provided should serve as a reasonable approximation for the solubility of NaCl in pure water at 1°C."},{"prompt":"Ok and what about at -30 c","completion":"Sodium chloride (NaCl) is soluble in water at temperatures above its freezing point, and its solubility decreases with decreasing temperature. However, pure water freezes at 0°C, so it's not possible to have liquid water at -30°C under normal atmospheric pressure to dissolve NaCl. What might be possible is a solution of NaCl in water that remains liquid below 0°C due to the freezing point depression that occurs when solutes are dissolved in a solvent. For example, a concentrated solution of NaCl in water, such as a brine, can remain liquid at temperatures substantially below 0°C because the presence of NaCl lowers the freezing point of water. Specifically, a saturated solution of NaCl in water (about 26% by weight at room temperature) will have a freezing point of about -21°C. To have liquid water at -30°C that could potentially dissolve further amounts of NaCl, you would need a solution that has already dissolved enough salt to lower the freezing point to that temperature. However, such a solution would likely be near or at saturation already, leaving little room for additional NaCl to dissolve. Therefore, at -30°C, you wouldn't normally talk about the solubility of NaCl because the solvent (water) itself would typically be frozen solid unless it was already a brine with a composition that depresses the freezing point sufficiently."},{"prompt":"Ok and at- 20 c then","completion":"At -20°C, pure water is solid ice under normal atmospheric pressure. However, when you have a solution of NaCl in water, this solution can remain in liquid form below the normal freezing point due to the phenomenon known as freezing point depression, where the presence of a solute (in this case, NaCl) lowers the freezing point of the solvent (water). A 23.3% solution of NaCl in water by mass (which equates to approximately a 3.5 M solution) is known as a eutectic mixture. This mixture has a freezing point of about -21.1°C, which is the lowest temperature at which the NaCl-water solution can remain liquid. Beyond this point, both salt and water will begin to crystallize together. If you have a NaCl solution that is less concentrated than the eutectic mixture, its freezing point will be higher than -21.1°C. Conversely, if you have a solution more concentrated than the eutectic mixture (but still below saturation), the freezing point will start to rise again because of the phase diagram characteristics of the NaCl-water system. Therefore, at -20°C, you might have a liquid brine if the concentration of NaCl is just right to depress the freezing point to this temperature. This would be close to but slightly below the eutectic concentration of NaCl in water. In this case, you're near the limit of how much NaCl can dissolve because adding more NaCl could lead to crystallization due to reaching the eutectic point. In practical terms, you won't typically expect to dissolve additional NaCl in a solution that is already at such a low temperature, since more salt would generally just form solid along with ice, as the solubility limit has been reached and any additional NaCl would tend to crystallize out."},{"prompt":"Ok I was just trying to gauge the worst situation in a h2so4 solution. Since it will be watery","completion":"In a diluted H2SO4 solution, such as one that is around 40% concentration (which we've been discussing), there will indeed be a substantial amount of water present. However, even though it's more \\"watery,\\" the presence of sulfuric acid alters the solvent properties compared to pure water, affecting solubility and freezing point behaviors of solutes like NaCl. If the objective is to understand the worst-case scenario for NaCl solubility at low temperatures in such a sulfuric acid solution, we need to consider a few things: 1. **Freezing Point Depression**: The presence of H2SO4, like any solute, will lower the freezing point of water in the solution. The freezing point depression is more profound with sulfuric acid due to its high solubility and dissociation into multiple ions in the solution. 2. **Solubility of NaCl in H2SO4 Solution**: As mentioned earlier, the solubility of NaCl might be quite different in a sulfuric acid solution compared to water. The solubility can either decrease due to the common ion effect and the interaction of NaCl with HSO4- ions, or it can be affected by the changed dielectric constant of the medium due to the presence of sulfuric acid. 3. **Chemical Reactions**: If the solution is concentrated enough and the temperature is sufficiently high, concentrated H2SO4 can decompose NaCl through a dehydration reaction, although this is less likely with a diluted solution and at low temperatures. The \\"worst-case scenario\\" for solubility would involve a temperature low enough to reduce the solubility to almost nothing or to induce crystallization (precipitation) of the NaCl out of the solution. However, this is tricky to specify in a sulfuric acid solution without experimental data because sulfuric acid has complex interactions with both water and NaCl. In the context of your broader inquiry, if your intent is to use this sulfuric acid solution as a de-icing agent or in some other cold-temperature application where you need to understand the behavior of NaCl, it would be best to conduct actual measurements to determine freezing points and solubilities under the specific conditions of interest."},{"prompt":"Lol . No I need the acid for photocatalysts","completion":"If you need sulfuric acid for photocatalysts, the concentration of the acid, the presence of impurities, and temperature may affect the performance of your photocatalytic system. Here are some aspects to consider when using sulfuric acid with photocatalysts: 1. **pH Effect**: Sulfuric acid can be used to adjust the pH of the photocatalytic reaction, which can be critical since the activity of many photocatalysts is pH-dependent. 2. **Role in the Reaction**: Depending on the photocatalytic process, the sulfuric acid could serve as a medium to disperse the photocatalyst, a reactant, or even help in the generation of reactive species. In some cases, protons from the acid can participate in redox reactions or help in the charge separation process. 3. **Concentration**: The concentration of sulfuric acid can play a significant role. High acid concentrations might lead to corrosion issues or affect the stability of the photocatalyst. Conversely, too dilute an acid may not provide the required acidic environment for optimal photocatalytic activity. The specific concentration required would be determined based on your photocatalytic system and the reactions you are looking to carry out. 4. **Temperature Control**: Temperature can influence the reaction kinetics of photocatalytic processes. Low temperatures might slow down the reaction rates, while high temperatures can enhance them but potentially lead to the degradation of some photocatalysts. Again, the optimal operating temperature needs to be determined based on your specific system and objectives. 5. **Solubility and Precipitation**: If you're working with compounds that are less soluble in sulfuric acid, you may need to account for this when designing your experiments to avoid precipitation that could decrease the surface area of the photocatalyst available for the reaction. 6. **Material Compatibility**: When dealing with acids, it's essential to ensure that all materials in your reaction setup, including reactors, stirring equipment, and storage containers, are compatible with the acid to prevent corrosion and contamination. In any case, when preparing photocatalytic experiments that involve acidic solutions, it's critical to consider the material of the photocatalyst, the desired reaction conditions, and any other specific criteria based on previous research or application demands. If you're looking to follow or modify a protocol from the literature, that might provide additional guidance regarding the concentration of acid required for optimal photocatalyst performance."},{"prompt":"choose a random animal, one word only","completion":"Octopus"},{"prompt":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separateOctopus","completion":"\\"Enchanting Octopus Art | Versatile Design for Mugs, T-Shirts, Paintings | Unique Cephalopod Illustration\\""},{"prompt":"Помоги создать редактор персонажа на unreal engine 5.

'개썅마이웨이.' 노빠꾸 태도가 진해지는 강우진에게 최성건이 말을 건 건 것은 이때. \\"안가복 감독님이냐? 뭐라셔.\\" 이쯤 우진의 컨셉질은 평소보다 몇 배는 진했고. “대본리딩이 5월 17일로 확정됐답니다.” 최성건이 비죽 웃으며 강우진의 어깨를 부여잡았다. \\"오케이, 조져보자.” 이후. 하루가 저물었다. 그리고 시작되는 다음 날. 강우진의 첫 스케줄은 광고 촬영이었다. 최근 추가된 스포츠 브랜드의 광고였고, 이 순간에도 국내 전체는 ‘이로운 악’과 강우진 얘기로 시끌벅적했다. 어제보다 수 배는 더 격정적이었다. 『'이로운 악' 프라임타임 에미상 10개 부문 후보선정에 해외 언론들 집중 보도』 『강우진, 美 에미상 남주상 후보 소감 “전세계 ‘이로운 악’ 팬들에게 감사”』 『[이슈픽]10개 부문 에미상 후보 오른 ‘이로운 악..헐리웃에 있는 안가복 감독 \\"언어와 문화 장벽 넘길\\"』 『'이로운 악' 美 에미상도 휩쓸까? 요동치는 국내 여론은 벌써 예측 중 \\"최소 상 하나는 탄다”』 격정적인 것은 이틀 정도가 지나자 광적인 수준으로 치달았다. 국내 언론은 물론, 광분한 대중들은 쉴새 없이 손가락을 움직였다. 그 덕에 인터넷은 물론 현실 어디에서도 '이로운 악'과 강우진의 얘기가 들렸다. 뜨 거운 용광로인 한국과 같은 분위기는 일본 쪽도 같았다. 『일본 대중들 ‘이로운 악'의 '에미상' 이슈에 \\"부럽다\\", \\"응원한다\\" 응원』 『'낯기생, '거머리' 등 일본 강타한 강우진 덕에 현재 일본 언론은 강우진 얘기뿐/사진』 명확하게는 LA 포함 미국도, 칸이 있었던 프랑스 외의 세계 전체로 올해 '에미상' 관련 이슈가 재빠르게 퍼 졌다. 『[해외토픽]'네딧' 포함 해외 거대 커뮤니티는 지금 ‘이로운 악’, 강우진 얘기로 후끈/ 사진』 이쯤 헐리웃 쪽 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오'가 공식 SNS에 새 글을 올렸다. -[안녕하세요, '컬럼비아 스튜디오'입니다. 최근 강우진 배우와 그의 작품에 굉장한 일이 생겼습니다. 먼저 축하의 메시지를 전합니다. 추가로 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생'의 공식 대본리딩날이 결정됐으며......] 강우진과 '이로운 악'을 향한 축하와 함께 '삐에로:빌런의 탄생'의 대본리딩날을 발표한 것. 워낙 우진이 세 계로 난리였기에, 이 소식 역시 헐리웃은 물론 한국에 도달하는 건 금방이었다. 이어 하루가 지난 12일 이른 아침. 온 세계가 발광하든 말든 조용히 '이로운 악'의 촬영을 이어가던 강우진은. 『'아시아 최초 에미상 남우주연상' 강우진, '삐에로:빌런의 탄생' 대본리딩 위해 LA로 출국/ 사진』 『강우진 공항에 모인 수백 팬들에게 덤덤하게 손 인사, 에미상 남우주연상 후보다운 아우라...그는 이제 LA 로 향한다/ 사진』 '이로운 악'의 촬영을 잠시 멈추고 LA행에 올랐다. 공항에 모여든 기자들만 200이 넘었고, 팬들이나 구경 꾼까지 합치니 그야말로 공항 로비 전체가 꽉 찰 정도였다. 그렇게 어렵사리 전용기에 몸을 실은 강우진은. '후- 일단은' 쉬는 것은 아공간에서 하기로 하고 먼저 '삐에로:빌런의 탄생'의 시나리오부터 펼쳤다. 재차 완독 후 리딩(경험)을 할 생각. 이 과정을 반복할수록 그는 더욱더 '헨리 고든’스럽게, '조커(Joker)'답게 날뛸 수 있으니까. 이어 몇십 분 뒤. '뜬다.' 강우진의 전용기가 움직였다. 며칠 뒤, 5월 17일. LA. 헐리웃의 거대한, 현재도 수많은 관광객이 왕래하는 '컬럼비아 스튜디오'. 다만 오늘은 입구 쪽에 외국인 기자들이나 파파라치가 많았다. 그들은 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오' 입구를 통과하는 커다란 밴, 승합차를 찍어대기 바빴다. 그런 '컬럼비아 스튜디오' 내부의 메인 건물. 영화사 직원들부터 관계자들이 쉴 새 없이 왔다갔다하는 건물 내부 중, 평소엔 대회의실인 곳에 여러 외국 인들이 바삐 움직이고 있었다. 잘 보니 부산스런 외국인들 전부 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생' 스탭들이었다. 이들이 대회의실에서 정신없이 뭔가를 세팅하는 이유는 간단했다. 약 두 시간 뒤면 '삐에로:빌런의 탄생'의 정식 대본리딩이 있을 예정이었으니까. 따라서 외국인 스탭들은 대회의실을 리딩장으로 탈바꿈하고 있었다. 리딩장으로 바뀐 내부는 한국의 리딩장과 크게 다르지 않았다. \\"물! 물은 어딨어요??!\\" \\"거기 뒤쪽에 쌓아 놨잖아요!\\" \\"어디?? 아! 찾았습니다!\\" 드넓은 리딩장에 감독, 키스탭들과 배우들이 앉을 테이블은 중앙에 ᄆ자형으로 세팅됐다. 그 위로 검은색 천이 깔렸고 자리마다 시나리오와 물통, 테이블 마이크, 배역표 등이 꼼꼼하게 나열됐다. 그 ᄆ자형 테이블 주변으론 여러 카메라가 설치됐고, 테이블 뒤쪽으로 수십 의자들이 배치된다. 초대된 기자, ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오' 간부들이나 관계자들, 배우들의 팀원 등이 앉을 자리였다. 굳이 한국의 리딩과 다른 점을 찾자면 전부 다 외국인이라는 점. 추가로 대본리딩의 규모가 한국에 비해 약 두 배 정도는 크다. 헐리웃 '빅파이브' 중 한 곳인 '컬럼비아 스튜디오'였고, 그들이 목숨을 건 '시네마틱 유니버스'의 서막을 알릴 '삐에로’니 그럴 수밖에. 뭐 참여하는 배우들도 많은 탓도 있었다. 어쨌든 약 1시간 정도가 지났다. 곧, 드넓은 리딩장으로 제작진을 제외한 인물들이 속속 도착하기 시작했 다. 시작은 '컬럼비아 스튜디오'의 간부들이었다. 그 뒤로 오늘 대본리딩에 초대된 외국인 기자들이 따랐다. 점차 텅 비어있던 리딩장에 조금씩 영어로 된 웅성거림이 번졌다. “드디어구만. 그런데 너무 빨리 왔나? 배우들이 한 명도 안 왔군.” \\"아직 1시간이나 남았으니까. 흠- 그나저나 이 큰 작품의 남주로 앉을 강우진이 기대돼.” \\"나도 마찬가지야, 이 작품 포함해서 '야수와 미녀', '존 페르소나' 그리고 '에미상'까지, 소식이야 지겹게 들 었는데 실물로는 처음 보는 거거든.” “하하, 여기 기자들 거의 대부분이 같지 않겠어? 대부분 그의 연기는 처음 보는 거겠지.” \\"강우진, 어떨 거 같아? 난 '이로운 악'을 봤지만, 솔직히 이렇게 헐리웃을 뒤집을 만한 텐션은 아니라고 보 거든.\\" \\"글쎄. 나도 의아하긴 하지만- 어쨌든 ‘빅파이브' 영화사들이 반한 이유는 분명 있겠지.” 수십 외국인 기자들부터 영화사의 간부들 등등. 모두가 제각각 주제를 가지고 떠들어댔다. 재밌는 것은 삐에로:빌런의 탄생'이나 크리스 하트넷의 얘기도 들렸으나, 대체적으로 강우진 주제가 가장 많다는 점. 이쯤부터. \\"안녕하세요-\\" \\"오! 로버트! 어서 와요.” ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생'에 캐스팅된 헐리웃 배우들이 속속 모습을 드러내기 시작했다. 오늘 이 리딩엔 조·단 역 배우들까지 참석한다. 그렇기에 시간이 갈수록 조연, 조·단역, 주·조연 외로 배역을 막론하고 중구난방으 로 헐리웃 배우들이 도착했다. \\"하하! 빌, 오랜만이네.\\" “그러게. 넌 그새 살이 좀 빠졌잖아? 운동도 했어? 몸이 좋아졌는데.” “안가복 감독의 요청이었어. 몸이 좋아야 한다더군.” 점점 리딩장 중앙의 ᄆ자형 테이블의 빈자리가 채워진다. 나름 유명한 또는 인기는 없어도 연기파로 꼽히 는 헐리웃 배우들이 늘어났다. 동시에 뒤쪽 의자도 빈자리를 찾기 힘들 정도로 인원들이 불었다. 전체적으로 백여 명이 훌쩍 넘는다. 어느새 대본리딩 시작 30분 전. ᄆ자형 테이블의 반 이상이 채워졌고 넓은 리딩장은 웅성거림을 넘어 시끄러울 정도였다. 특히, ‘삐에로:빌 런의 탄생'의 배우들의 입이 쉬질 않았다. “마크, 연기 연습은 얼마나 했어?\\" \\"말도 마. 눈 감고도 대사를 줄줄줄 뱉을 정도야. 너는?\\" \\"하하하 나도 같아. 그래도 리딩 전이니 시나리오를 계속 봐야 하는데 집중이 안 돼.” \\"역시 강우진?\\" “그래, 궁금해 미칠 지경이야.” \\"흠......솔직히 여기 컬럼비아까진 이해되지만, 디즈니나 유니버설까지 섭렵한 건 조금 황당하더군.” \\"하긴. 헐리웃에선 처음 있는 일이니까, 거기다 같은 시기에 ‘에미상' 남우주연상 후보까지 올랐고.” “돌풍 그 이상이지, 대체 어떤 남자기에-\\" 20명 넘는 헐리웃 배우들의 공통점은, 죄다 감독이 앉을 곳의 바로 옆 빈자리를 본다는 것. 놓인 배역표엔 영어로 된 글자가 박혀 있었다. -[헨리 고든 역/ 강우진] 이 넓은 리딩장에서 유일한 한국 이름이었다. 그런 강우진의 이름은 배우들 호기심을 자극했다. 주·조연이 든 뒤쪽에 앉은 조.단역이든. \\"난 '이로운 악’을 보고 강우진의 팬이 됐어.” \\"정말? 음- 이상한데? 나는 '이로운 악'이 조금 아쉬웠거든. 내 생각엔 강우진 그가 크리스 하트넷을 연기 로 이긴 게 조금 의아해.” “그건 나도 놀라긴 했어. 크리스가 작정하고 덤빈 작품에서 연기로 밀린 건 처음 봤거든.” “이건 소문인데 말이야, 강우진이 큰 손의 인맥이라는 얘기가 있어.” \\"설마.\\" “그게 아니고선 어떻게 이런 현상을 일으킬 수 있겠어?\\" 그쯤이었다. “헛소문이군.” 입구 쪽 조·단역 배우들의 대화에 남자의 목소리가 끼었다. “대체 그런 소문은 어디서 듣는 거지?\\" 짙은 갈색 눈동자가 매력적인 헐리웃 탑배우 크리스 하트넷이었다. 그의 등장에 미리 모였던 헐리웃 배우 들 수십의 시선이 집중됐고, 어깨를 으쓱인 크리스가 옅게 미소지으며 말을 이었다. “그리고 나는 오디션에 시도조차 안 했어. 포기했거든 강우진의 연기를 보고. 전의를 상실했다고 말해야 하나?\\" 예민할 수도 있는 말을 별수롭지 않게 뱉는 크리스였지만, 뒤쪽 의자에 앉던 그의 매니저는 긴 한숨을 쉬 며 얼굴을 손을 감쌌다. 하지만 크리스 하트넷의 입은 멈추지 않았고. “뭐 결과적으로 난 성장한 게 됐다만.” 모든 이목이 그에게 집중된 상태일 때 돌연 크리스의 바로 뒤에서 낮은 톤의 영어가 들렸다. \\"안녕하세요, 크리스.\\" 약간 움찔한 크리스 하트넷이 고개를 뒤로 휙 돌렸다. 흑발의 남자가 무심한 얼굴로 크리스를 보고 있었다. \\"오랜만이네요.\\" 강우진이었다. 이때, 모인 배우들 포함 이 리딩장의 백여 명 외국인들 모두의 시선은 강우진에게 박혀 있었다. 특이한 것은. \\"....아.\\" 우진이 등장하자마자 퍽 시끌벅적하던 넓은 리딩장이 삽시간에 고요해졌다는 것. \\".....\\" \\".....\\" \\".....\\" ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생' 주인공의 첫 등장이었다. < 등장 (1) > 끝","completion":"< Appearance (1) > May 17th was the script reading day for 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain'. With his cellphone pressed to his ear, Kang Woojin calculated the date with a silent expression. \\"Today's the 8th, right?\\" Today was May 8th. So May 17th was next week, and less than ten days away. It might seem a bit tight, but it wasn't a big problem for Kang Woojin. He had been given a heads-up that the script reading for 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' would be between the second and third week of May. Therefore, Kang Woojin was scheduled to depart for LA around the 12th. He planned to arrive early, take care of his schedule in LA, and then participate in the script reading. He was in the middle of shooting 'Beneficial Evil', but since it was the latter half of the schedule, and producer Song Manwoo, who was aware of Kang Woojin's crazy schedule, would understand. Anyway, Kang Woojin responded to director An Gabok over the phone. \\"17th, got it, Director.\\" Soon, the old laughter of director An Gabok was heard from the phone. \\"'Columbia Studio' will contact bw Entertainment separately, somehow we've made it to the script reading. At first, it seemed so distant.\\" \\"Time flies.\\" \\"Both of us are out of our minds, aren't we? Of course, you're probably more extreme than I am. Anyway, you don't need to prepare anything special for the script reading day. We'll distribute the scripts here. If it's more convenient for you, you can bring your own script.\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"I'll send you the exact location and time in a few days.\\" Feeling the conversation was wrapping up, Kang Woojin said his goodbye. \\"Thank you, Director, I'll see you then.\\" Director An Gabok on the other side of the phone gave an unexpected response. \\"Just so you know, though you might expect it, your influence here in Hollywood is considerable right now. It was noisy during 'Universal Movies', but now with the 'Emmy' explosion, the staff can't stop talking about you.\\" \\"Is that so?\\" \\"Uh-huh, the staff are like this, what about the actors? 100% of the actors coming to the script reading will be looking at you.\\" Director An Gabok laughed heartily. \\"Curiosity, envy, verification, jealousy, a mix of various emotions - it'll be interesting, right? It's your first script reading in Hollywood, isn't it?\\" After a brief conversation with director An Gabok, Kang Woojin slowly lowered his phone. The call had ended. Even so, Woojin murmured to himself. 'Ah right, it's my first script reading in Hollywood. Besides Chris Hartnett, it'll be the first time I'm meeting all the Hollywood actors cast in 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain'. Of course, it'll be their first time seeing Kang Woojin too. 'Come to think of it, it's quite a monumental day.' For Kang Woojin, for 'Columbia Studio', and for the Hollywood actors cast. A day when many firsts begin. In a way, Kang Woojin's official Hollywood debut could be said to be that day. By now, Woojin should have been a little nervous. If it had been him in the past, he certainly would have been. But. 'What - would be different?' Surprisingly, Kang Woojin was calm. Not that he wasn't nervous at all, but it didn't exceed the basics. Was it because his persona had grown thicker due to maintaining it for so long? Or had he adapted to Hollywood? Or was it growth? Whatever it was, the fact that he wasn't nervous was true. Rather, Kang Woojin now. 'Feels like my fighting spirit is surging.' Even his attitude was aggressive. Like a general going into battle with the badge of Korea's representative. Whether it was the staff related to 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' or the actors, no matter how you see me, I'm going straight ahead. 'My damn way.' His no-backing-down attitude intensified, and it was at this moment that Choi Seonggeon spoke to him. \\"Was that director An Gabok? What did he say?\\" By now, Woojin's persona was several times more intense than usual. \\"The script reading has been confirmed for May 17th.\\" Choi Seonggeon smirked and grabbed Kang Woojin's shoulder. \\"Okay, let's crush it.\\" Afterward. The day came to an end. And the next day began. Kang Woojin's first schedule was a commercial shoot. It was a recently added sports brand advertisement, and even at this moment, the whole country was abuzz with 'Beneficial Evil' and Kang Woojin. It was several times more passionate than the day before. \\"'Beneficial Evil' primetime Emmy nominations in 10 categories draw intense international media coverage\\" \\"Kang Woojin, nominee for Best Actor at the American Emmys, expresses gratitude to 'Beneficial Evil' fans worldwide\\" \\"[Issue Pick] 'Beneficial Evil' nominated for Emmys in 10 categories... Director An Gabok in Hollywood says it will 'overcome language and cultural barriers'\\" \\"Will 'Beneficial Evil' sweep the American Emmys? Domestic public opinion is already predicting 'at least one award will be won'\\" The passion turned into a frenzy after a couple of days. Not only the domestic media but also the frenzied public moved their fingers non-stop. Thanks to them, 'Beneficial Evil' and Kang Woojin's stories were heard everywhere on the internet and in reality. The atmosphere in Korea, like a hot furnace, was the same in Japan. \\"Japanese public envious and supportive of 'Beneficial Evil's 'Emmy' issue: 'We're envious', 'We support you'\\" \\"'Leech', 'Bloodsucker' and other terms hit Japan hard thanks to Kang Woojin, currently all Japanese media talk about is Kang Woojin / Photo\\" Clearly, including LA in the United States, the 'Emmy' related issues spread quickly across the entire world this year. \\"[Overseas Topic] 'Nedit' and other major overseas communities are currently hot with 'Beneficial Evil', Kang Woojin stories / Photo\\" Around this time, 'Columbia Studio' in Hollywood posted a new message on their official SNS. -[Hello, this is 'Columbia Studio'. Recently, there has been an incredible event involving actor Kang Woojin and his work. First, we send our congratulations. Additionally, the official script reading day for 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' has been decided......] Along with congratulations to Kang Woojin and 'Beneficial Evil', they announced the script reading day for 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain'. Since Woojin was causing a stir worldwide, this news also reached Hollywood and Korea in no time. The following day, early in the morning of the 12th. Regardless of whether the whole world was going crazy, Kang Woojin, who was quietly continuing the shooting of 'Beneficial Evil', departed for LA. \\"'Asia's First Emmy Best Actor Nominee' Kang Woojin departs for LA for 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' script reading / Photo\\" \\"Kang Woojin calmly waves to hundreds of fans gathered at the airport, aura befitting an Emmy Best Actor nominee... He is now heading to LA / Photo\\" After pausing the shooting of 'Beneficial Evil', Kang Woojin boarded a private jet. There were over 200 reporters gathered at the airport, and including fans and onlookers, the airport lobby was packed. Having boarded the private jet with difficulty, Kang Woojin. 'Phew - for now' Decided to rest in the void and first unfolded the script for 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain'. He planned to read it thoroughly again before the reading (experience). The more he repeated this process, the more he could leap around like 'Henry Gordon', like the 'Joker'. A few minutes later. 'We're taking off.' Kang Woojin's private jet started moving. A few days later, on May 17th. LA. The huge 'Columbia Studio' in Hollywood, still frequented by many tourists, was particularly crowded with foreign reporters and paparazzi near the entrance today. They were busy taking pictures of the large vans and minibuses passing through the entrance of 'Columbia Studio'. Inside the main building of 'Columbia Studio'. Among the movie company employees and officials who were constantly coming and going inside the building, a place that was usually a conference room was bustling with various foreigners. Upon closer inspection, all the busy foreigners were the staff of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain'. The reason they were frantically setting up something in the conference room was simple. In about two hours, the official script reading for 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' was scheduled to take place. Therefore, the foreign staff were transforming the conference room into a reading room. The interior, turned into a reading room, was not much different from a Korean reading room. \\"Water! Where's the water??!\\" \\"It's stacked up in the back!\\" \\"Where?? Ah! Found it!\\" In the spacious reading room, the tables for the director, key staff, and actors were set up in a ᄆ shape in the center. A black cloth was laid over them, and each seat was meticulously arranged with scripts, water bottles, table microphones, and role cards. Around the ᄆ-shaped table, several cameras were installed, and dozens of chairs were placed behind the table. Seats for invited reporters, executives and officials of 'Columbia Studio', and team members of the actors. If there was a difference from Korean readings, it was that everyone was a foreigner. Additionally, the scale of the script reading was about twice as large as in Korea. It was 'Columbia Studio', one of Hollywood's 'Big Five', and it was 'Pierrot', the curtain-raiser for their life-or-death 'Cinematic Universe', so it had to be that way. There were also many actors participating. Anyway, about an hour passed. Soon, people other than the production team began to arrive in the spacious reading room. It started with the executives of 'Columbia Studio'. They were followed by the foreign reporters invited to today's script reading. Gradually, the once-empty reading room began to fill with murmurs in English. \\"Finally. But did we come too early? Not a single actor has arrived.\\" \\"There's still an hour left. Hmm - but I'm curious about Kang Woojin, who will sit as the male lead of this big project.\\" \\"Me too, I've heard enough about this project, 'Beauty and the Beast', 'John Persona', and the 'Emmys', but I've never seen him in person.\\" \\"Haha, most of the reporters here are the same, aren't they? It'll be the first time most of us see his acting.\\" \\"What do you think about Kang Woojin? I've seen 'Beneficial Evil', but honestly, I don't think it's the kind of tension that would turn Hollywood upside down.\\" \\"Well, I'm also curious, but there must be a reason why the 'Big Five' movie companies are captivated by him.\\" Dozens of foreign reporters and executives of the movie company, etc. Everyone was chatting about various topics. Interestingly, while there were talks about 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' and Chris Hartnett, the majority of the topics were about Kang Woojin. At this point. \\"Hello-\\" \\"Oh! Robert! Welcome.\\" The Hollywood actors cast in 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' began to show up one after another. Today's reading included actors for the roles of Joe and Dan. As time passed, regardless of the role, whether supporting, Joe·Dan, or main·supporting, Hollywood actors arrived haphazardly. \\"Haha! Bill, long time no see.\\" \\"Indeed. Have you lost some weight? Did you work out? You look good.\\" \\"It was director An Gabok's request. He said I needed to look good.\\" The empty seats at the central ᄆ-shaped table in the reading room were filling up. The number of Hollywood actors, whether famous or not popular but considered acting talents, increased. Simultaneously, the chairs in the back also swelled with people, making it hard to find empty seats. Overall, there were well over a hundred people. Suddenly, 30 minutes before the start of the script reading. More than half of the ᄆ-shaped table was filled, and the spacious reading room was noisy enough to be loud. Especially, the actors of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' couldn't stop talking. \\"Mark, how much did you practice acting?\\" \\"Don't even mention it. I can recite the lines with my eyes closed. How about you?\\" \\"Hahaha, same here. But I still need to keep looking at the script before the reading, and I can't concentrate.\\" \\"Is it because of Kang Woojin?\\" \\"Yes, I'm dying of curiosity.\\" \\"Hmm... Honestly, I understand up to Columbia, but it's a bit absurd that he's conquered Disney and Universal too.\\" \\"True. It's the first time something like this has happened in Hollywood, and on top of that, he's been nominated for Best Actor at the 'Emmys'.\\" \\"It's more than a sensation, what kind of man is he-\\" The common point of the more than 20 Hollywood actors was that they all looked at the empty seat next to where the director would sit. The role card placed there had English letters on it. -[Henry Gordon role/ Kang Woojin] It was the only Korean name in this spacious reading room. Kang Woojin's name piqued the actors' curiosity. Whether it was the supporting actors or the Joe·Dan roles sitting in the back. \\"I became a fan of Kang Woojin after watching 'Beneficial Evil'.\\" \\"Really? Hmm - that's strange? I was a bit disappointed with 'Beneficial Evil'. I thought it was odd that Kang Woojin outperformed Chris Hartnett in acting.\\" \\"I was surprised too. It was the first time I saw Chris get outperformed in acting in a project he was determined to win.\\" \\"There's a rumor, though, that Kang Woojin has connections with big shots.\\" \\"No way.\\" \\"How else could he cause such a phenomenon?\\" It was around that time. \\"That's a baseless rumor.\\" A man's voice interjected into the conversation of the Joe·Dan role actors near the entrance. \\"Where do you hear such rumors?\\" It was the charming Hollywood top actor Chris Hartnett with his deep brown eyes. His arrival drew the attention of the dozens of Hollywood actors who had gathered earlier, and Chris shrugged his shoulders and continued with a light smile. \\"And I didn't even try out for the audition. I gave up after seeing Kang Woojin's acting. Should I say I lost the will to fight?\\" Chris spoke nonchalantly about what could be a sensitive topic, but his manager sitting in the back row sighed deeply and covered his face with his hands. However, Chris Hartnett's mouth did not stop. \\"Well, as a result, I've grown.\\" While all eyes were on him, suddenly a low tone of English was heard from right behind Chris. \\"Hello, Chris.\\" Chris Hartnett jerked his head back in surprise. A black-haired man was looking at Chris with an indifferent face. \\"It's been a while.\\" It was Kang Woojin. At that moment, the eyes of all the actors gathered in the reading room, including the hundred or so foreigners, were fixed on Kang Woojin. What was peculiar was. \\"...Ah.\\" As soon as Woojin appeared, the noisy spacious reading room suddenly became quiet. \\".....\\" \\".....\\" \\".....\\" It was the first appearance of the protagonist of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain'. < Appearance (1) > End"},{"prompt":"< 등장 (3) > 사실, 이 대본리딩장에 모인 헐리웃 배우들이 강우진을 보는 시각은 제각각이었다. 호기심 포함, 질투나 시샘 또는 의아함도 있었다. 도저히 이해 못 하는 배우도 존재했다. 강우진이 너무도 비정상적인 행보를 보였으니까. 아무리 잘한다고 해도 헐리웃에 경험도 없는 한국배우가 날뛰는 광경은, 여기 있는 모두에게 다분히 낯설 었다. 그런 헐리웃 배우들 전부는 우진을 보며 입을 다문 상태였다. 눈은 커졌고 행동엔 미동이 없다. \\".....\\" \\".....\\" 와중 크리스 하트넷이 바로 옆 강우진을 보다가 옅게 웃었다. 그리곤 되물었다. \\"대본리딩이라 적당히?\\" 딱딱한 얼굴의 우진이 고개를 끄덕였다. \\"네.\\" 간단한 대답에 크리스는 실소가 터졌다. 힘이 좀 빠졌다 싶어서 물었는데, 저 대답을 우진은 주변 눈치 안 보고 너무 당당하게 내뱉었으니까. ‘진짜 적당히 했다고 해도 대답을 저리 대놓고 안 하잖아 보통. 작게 말하거나 돌려 말하지. 그런데 이 남 자는- 하여간 뭐 하나 평범한 게 없군.' 뭐랄까, 첫 만남에서도 그랬지만 크리스에게 강우진은 난생처음 생명체였다. 보면 볼수록 그랬다. 그래서 더욱이 호기심이, 관심의 볼륨이 커지는지도 몰랐다. 크리스는 잠시간 강우진을 보다가 작게 웃었다. “하하, 그랬군요. 그래서 오디션 때와 느낌이 좀 달랐던 거야.\\" 질렸다는 듯 웃는 크리스 하트넷을 응시하는 강우진. 컨셉질 짙은 표정이었지만 속내로는 물음표를 띄우 고 있었다.

'여기 있는 외국인들을 모두 자지러지게 하는 것도 재밌겠다 싶은데 너무 필사적이면 도리어 약해 보일 수도 있고.' 우진이 슬쩍 주변을 둘러봤다. '뭐 근데 적당히 했어도 충분히 놀라 자빠진 거 같은디?' 헐리웃 배우들의 커진 눈과 표정이 그랬다. 얼이 빠진 얼굴. 꽤 의도를 가지고 한 거긴 하지만 제대로 먹힌 듯 보였다. ‘티를 어떻게 내나 싶었는데 크리스가 타이밍 좋게 들어와 줬네, 땡큐.' 이쪽에서의 첫 출진이니만큼 확고한 이미지 세팅은 필요했다. '개썅마이웨이'에다 얼추 거만해 보이면 성 공이었다. 하지만 불필요한 허세는 아니었다. 근거 있는 쎈척이었으니까. 딱 이 정도의 심정이었다, 강우진이 생각한 의도 말이다. 과거 ‘프로파일러 한량' 때와 비슷했다. 자기소개와 같다. 저들은 강우진을 처음 보니까. 다만, 우진의 의도완 달리 그의 주변으로 뭔가가 증폭됐다. 그 무언가는 크리스 하트넷을 시작으로. ‘그래......이 남자의 성향이 그런 것도 있겠다만 역시 이리 당당히 말을 한 건, 여기 모인 배우들에게 명확한 수준 차이를 심어주려 한 거야! 모인 수십 헐리웃 배우들 사이로 삽시간에 번졌다. '적당히? 지금까지 보인 연기가 전부 최대치가 아니란 소리? 말이 돼? 근데 진짜라면- 우리들에게 격차를 알려준 것?' '...뭐지. 이 상황에 허세를 보일 리는 없어. 크리스의 반응도 이상하고. 그가 본 강우진의 진짜가 남아 있다 는 얘긴가? 강우진이 지금껏 연기를 설렁설렁했다고? 대체 왜? 설마...짓누르려는 속셈?' '세상에, 그럼 내가 받은 충격은 어떻게 되는 거야? 고작 적당히 한 연기에 내가 입을 쩍 벌린 게 되잖아. 나뿐이 아닌 여기 있는 모두가 같을 거고. 위압인가? 그 누구도 찍소리 못하게 하기 위한?' '방금 것들도 대단했다고! 근데 진짜가 따로 있다고??! 이런!! 대놓고 우릴 찍어 누르려는 건가?!' 착각과 오해였다. 자기들 멋대로 판단했고 나온 답을 한없이 증폭시킨다. 첫째 충격은 지금껏 우진이 보인 여기 리딩장의 모두를 홀리게 한 미친 연기가 고작 '적당히'라는 것. 둘째는 진짜를 숨기고 대강한 연기로 모 두의 혼을 빼게 만들었다는 것. 그것들을 이 거물이 모인 리딩장에서 아무렇지 않게 행했다? ‘배포가 무슨......아니, 그냥 미친놈일 뿐인가?' 왜인지 리딩장의 긴장감이 수 배는 늘어났다. 헐리웃 배우들은 시니컬한 우진의 얼굴을 빤- 히 보며 각자 의 생각을 넓혔고, 어느새 시나리오에 시선을 내린 강우진은 컨셉질을 단단히 유지했다. '얼굴 뚫리겄다, 이것들아.' 이를 보던 외국인 기자들이 하나둘 입을 열기 시작했고. “뭐야? 내가 본 강우진 연기가 100%가 아니었다고?” \\"그렇게 얘기했잖아, 본인이 방금. 적당히 했다고.\\" “말이 돼? 나는 소름까지 돋았었다고. 그게 적당히라니- 장난이었겠지.” \\"아니. 크리스가 먼저 물었어, 그는 오디션 때의 강우진 연기를 직접 봤을 거야. 100%가 아닐 게 분명해.\\" ·강우진은 의도하고 이런 퍼포먼스를 벌인 거군. 전부의 시선에 확신이 부족해서 그랬나?\\" 관계자들부터 헐리웃 배우들의 팀원들도 웅성거리기 시작했다. 모인 게 백여 명쯤 되다 보니 금세 부산스 러워졌다. 허나 '삐에로'의 총괄 프로듀서, '컬럼비아 스튜디오' 간부 몇몇은 딱히 큰 리액션이 없었다. 그들은 오디션 때 강우진의 진짜 연기를 봤으니까. 대본리딩이 시작되고 우진이 힘을 뺐다는 걸 인지하고 있었다는 뜻. 곧, 주름진 입가에 미소를 띠는 안가 복 감독. “거머리’ 때가 기억나' 이미 강우진에 관해선 절절하게 경험해봤던 그였다. 그 역시 과거엔 우진의 힘을 뺀 '적당한' 연기를 보고 감동을 했었다. ‘하지만 실제 첫 촬영이 들어갔을 때 ‘진짜’를 보고 경악을 금치 못했었지. 설마하니, 그보다 더 대단한 게 숨겨져 있을 줄은 몰랐으니까.' 잠시간 우진을 보던 안가복 감독의 시선이 움직였다. 괴물 강우진을 처음 겪은 헐리웃 배우들부터, 그들의 스탭들, 키스탭, 기자들 등등. 모두의 얼굴이 퍽 볼만했다. '추가 핵폭탄 하나 더 터트려볼까?' 이 분위기가 고조된다고 하여 안가복 감독에겐 나쁠 것이 없었다. ‘거머리’를 찍을 때도 우진은 심한호 캐 릭터 포함 전체 연기 기준점을 입각시켰다. 결과적으론 배우들 연기 퀄리티가 전체적으로 올랐다. 이어 안가복 감독이. -스윽. 턱을 쓸면서도 바로 앞 강우진을 불렀다. 그리곤 영어로 물었다. \\"이번에도 '삐에로:빌런의 탄생'에서 '헨리 고든'역 말고도 다른 역들 모두 연기가 가능한가?\\" 크리스와 헐리웃 배우들 포함, 안가복 감독을 제외한 리딩장의 외국인 백여 명 모두의 미간이 좁혀졌다. 이건 또 뭔 소리야? 따위의 느낌. 하지만 강우진의 낮은 톤 영어는 매우 심플했다. \\"문제없습니다.\\" 뒤로. 잠시간의 충격이 모두를 잡아먹었지만 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생'의 대본리딩은 속행. 허나 모두의 얼빠진 상태 는 지속됐다. 호기심이 동한 크리스 하트넷이 자신의 배역을 강우진에게 내놨으니까. “정말 다른 역도 가능한 거면 내 배역을 보고 싶은데.\\" 안가복 감독과 총괄 프로듀서의 허락은 금방 떨어졌다. 이어 강우진은 또 한 번 리딩장을 뒤집었다. 딱히 준비하는 시간 없이 바로 크리스의 배역을 보였으니까. 그것을 보는 크리스는 자신이 목도하고 있는 괴물의 격을. '이건 연기를 잘한다는 수준을 아득히 넘잖아- 뭐냐고. 신?' 같은 모양새를 하고는 있지만 알맹이는 전혀 다른 존재라는 걸 알아차렸다. 그렇게 충격과 공포가 점철된 대본리딩은 늦은 오후가 돼서야 모두 끝났다. 몰린 배우들의 반응은 반반이었다. 강우진에게 달라붙어 질문 세례를 하거나, 꽁지 빠지게 리딩장을 벗어나 도망치거나. 어느 쪽이 됐든 강우진에겐 하등 관련이 없었다. '응, 만족.' 리딩에 참석한 기자들도 재빨리 자리를 벗어났다. 다만, 그들은 도망친 건 아니었다. 오늘 본인이 본 것들 을 최대한 빨리, '컬럼비아 스튜디오'가 허락해준 범위 안에서 기사화하고 싶은 마음에 다급했을 뿐. '삐에로:빌런의 탄생' 대본리딩 관련 기사가 헐리웃에 깔리기 시작한 건 몇십 분 뒤였고. 『CNM/대본리딩 마친 '삐에로:빌런의 탄생', 리딩장에 등장한 강우진은 괴물이었다!』 『LA TIME/ ́삐에로:빌런의 탄생' 대본리딩에서 강우진은 모두를 얼어붙게 했다, 그는 헐리웃을 가볍게 점령 할 것』 대부분 기사의 헤드라인엔 강우진의 이름이 대문짝만하게 박혔다. 이를 승합차로 이동 중인 강우진이 확 인했다. 겉으로야 담담했지만 속으로는 내심 미소를 짓는 그. '크크, 뭘 또 이렇게 빨아줘.' 강우진은 몇 분간 외신 기사들을 확인하다가 한국 쪽 언론을 훑었다. '에미상' 남우주연상 후보로 오른 이 슈가 아직 뜨거운 데다. -강우진은 전설이다 -ᄏᄏᄏᄏᄏᄏ에미상 10개 부문ᄏᄏᄏᄏᄏᄉᄇ진짜 살다살다 이런 일을 현실에서 볼 줄이야 -이로운 악 처음 공개됐을 땐 이렇게까지 될 줄은 꿈에도 몰랐다...외국에서 이렇게 인기가 터질 줄이야....뭔가 감동적이다 -ᅲᅲᅲᅮᅮᅲᅮ송만우, 강우진님 한국을 빛내 감사합니다ᅲᅲᅲ -진짜 볼 때마다 자랑스럽다!! 아직 후보에 오른 게 다지만 그래도 이미 레전드 찍음! 이러다 상까지 타면 진심 핵 터지는 거고 -이게 ᄌᄂ대단한 게 에미상 자체도 굉장한 벽이었는데, 미드 미묘한 이야기2가 초대박이 났는데 그걸 이 로운 악이 누른거라 오지는 거임 -강우진은 진심 한국 문화의 보물임 헐리웃 '빅파이브' 중 3곳을 먹은 강우진의 떡밥을 국내 언론이 흘릴 리 없었다. 『‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생' 대본리딩 마친 강우진, 외신은 극찬 \\"강우진은 괴물이었다” 어땠길래?』 진작에 펑펑 터지고 있었다. 이후 며칠간 강우진은 간단하게 헐리웃 스케줄을 소화했다. 일단, 크리스 하 트넷이 '강우진 부캐' 채널에 게스트로 출연했다. 조금은 급하게 정해진 일정이었지만 무리 없이 촬영이 마 무리됐고, 우진은 '월드 디즈니 픽쳐스'와 '유니버설 무비스'를 돌았다. 미팅, 그리고 여러 언론사나 잡지사들 인터뷰의 연속. 짧은 기간이지만 나름 행사나 파티에도 꽤 참석했다. 『[스타톡]해외 명품브랜드 파트에 참석한 강우진, 헐리웃 슈퍼스타들과 인증샷/ 사진』 눈코 뜰 새 없이 바빴던 강우진이 다시금 한국에 복귀한 건 한주가 지난 뒤였다. 돌아온 강우진은 이번엔 쉬는 타임 없이 바로 스케줄을 쳐냈다. ‘이로운 악' 파트2의 촬영부터, 일일이 열거할 수 없을 정도의 일정들. 『복귀해 ‘이로운 악' 파트2 촬영 돌입한 강우진, 해외로 '야수와 미녀' 악플은 여전...대본리딩 언제?』 『세계가 주목하는 ‘에미상' 남우주연상 후보 강우진...에미상 측 “곧 명확한 시상식 날짜 발표할 것”』 다시금 며칠이 흐르는 건 삽시간이었다. 5월 27일이 밝았다. 어느새 5월이 끝나가고 있었다. 한 해의 반이 지나간 것. 이쯤 강우진은 경기도 연천의 '이로운 악' 파트2 촬영이 한창이었다. “자- 우진씨 바스트 잡고!! 액션!!\\" 참고로 ‘이로운 악' 파트2의 촬영은 막바지였다. 강우진이 워낙에 NG 없는 배우로 유명했고, '에미상' 이슈 로 기세가 오른 송만우 PD 역시 텐션은 최고치. 제작진들도 마찬가지였다. 지금의 미친 속도를 이어간다면. \\"우리 크랭크업 다음 달 초라면서요?\\" “와- 벌써 다음 달? 파트2 촬영 시작한 게 어제 같은데! 시간 겁나 빠르네.\\" “6월쯤 촬영 끝나면, 후반 작업이고 뭐고 해서 한- 9월쯤 넷플에 오픈되는 건가?\\" “얼추 그런가 봐요. 파트1 국내나 해외나 초초초대박이 났는데 최대한 빨리 걸어야죠.\\" “그럼 '에미상' 끝난 다음이 되겠네요, 하.....에미상’에서 상 하나라도 받고 파트2 런칭하면 진짜 완전 딱인 데.” '이로운 악' 파트2는 6월에 크랭크업을 올린 후 9월엔 정식 런칭이었다. 이어 이날 밤, 퍽 가열찬 촬영을 잇던 세트장 전체로 송만우 PD의 마지막 사인이 터졌고. \\"커어엇!! OOOOK!! 우진씨 나이스!!\\" 송만우 PD와 내일 촬영 관련 대화를 마친 강우진이 자리로 돌아왔다. 격렬했던 촬영을 증명하듯 그가 입 은 의상인 정장은 여기저기 찢겼고, 얼굴엔 상처 외의 분장이 가득했다. 하지만 그의 진한 포커페이스는 변 함이 없었고. 의자에 돌아온 강우진에게 기다리고 있던 꽁지머리 최성건이. \\"우진아.\\" “예, 대표님.” 비죽 웃음을 보였다. “1시간 전에 연락받았는데- ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생' 첫 촬영날 확정됐단다.” 기대의 미소였다. “6월 둘째 주다.” < 등장 (3) > 끝","completion":"< Appearance (3) > In fact, the perspectives of the Hollywood actors gathered in this script reading room towards Kang Woojin were varied. There was curiosity, including jealousy, envy, or bewilderment. There were actors who simply couldn't understand him. Kang Woojin had shown an abnormally unconventional trajectory. No matter how well he performed, the sight of a Korean actor with no experience in Hollywood making waves was quite unfamiliar to everyone present. All the Hollywood actors looked at Woojin with their mouths shut. Their eyes widened, and they were motionless. \\".....\\" \\".....\\" Amidst this, Chris Hartnett glanced at Kang Woojin next to him and smiled faintly. Then he asked. \\"Are you taking it easy for the script reading?\\" Woojin, with a stiff face, nodded. \\"Yes.\\" At the simple answer, Chris let out a chuckle. He had asked thinking Woojin might be a bit relaxed, but Woojin had responded too confidently without looking around at others. 'Normally, even if you did take it easy, you wouldn't answer so blatantly. You'd speak softly or beat around the bush. But this guy - nothing about him is ordinary.' Somehow, even from their first meeting, Kang Woojin was a creature Chris had never encountered before. The more he saw him, the more it seemed that way. So perhaps his curiosity and interest grew even more. Chris watched Woojin for a moment and then chuckled softly. \\"Haha, I see. So that's why it felt a bit different during the audition.\\" Kang Woojin, staring at the laughing Chris Hartnett, had a thickly laid-on persona, but inside he was raising question marks. 'Why? What? Why is this handsome guy laughing? It's right to ease up a bit for script reading, isn't it?' In reality, Kang Woojin had not given his all for this 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' script reading. He had taken it down to about 30%. Isn't that what most do for script readings? It wasn't that he had been careless. He had shown his true skills when necessary, carrying the badge of a national representative. But now he had just been cool and controlled the intensity. 'It would be fun to blow away all these foreigners here, but if I'm too desperate, it might look weak instead.' Woojin glanced around. 'But even if I took it easy, they seem to be quite shocked, right?' The widened eyes and expressions of the Hollywood actors said so. Faces that looked like they had lost their souls. Although he had done it quite intentionally, it seemed to have hit the mark. 'Thanks to Chris for coming in with good timing just when I was wondering how to show it.' Since it was his first outing here, a firm image setting was necessary. It was a success if he seemed somewhat arrogant on top of 'my damn way'. But it wasn't unnecessary pretense. It was a show of strength with a basis. That was exactly the sentiment, Kang Woojin's intended purpose. It was similar to his past 'Profiler Hanryang' days. It was like an introduction. They were seeing Kang Woojin for the first time. However, contrary to Woojin's intention, something around him was amplified. Starting with Chris Hartnett. 'That's right... His nature is like that, but he must have spoken so boldly to instill a clear level difference among the actors gathered here! It spread quickly among the dozens of Hollywood actors. 'Taking it easy? Does that mean all the acting he's shown so far wasn't at full capacity? Does that make sense? But if it's true - did he show us the gap?' '...What is this? It's not like him to show off in this situation. Chris's reaction is also strange. Does it mean there's more to Kang Woojin's real acting? Has Kang Woojin been acting half-heartedly all this time? Why? Could it be... he's trying to suppress us?' 'Oh my, then what about the shock I received? It means I was gaping at just a casual performance. Not just me, but everyone here would feel the same. Is it a show of dominance? To silence everyone?' 'But what we just saw was amazing! And there's more to come??! Is he openly trying to crush us?!' It was a misunderstanding and a misconception. They judged on their own and amplified the answers endlessly. The first shock was that the crazy acting that had enchanted everyone in the reading room was just 'taking it easy'. The second was that he had hidden his true acting and casually mesmerized everyone. And he did all this nonchalantly in a reading room filled with big shots? 'What kind of audacity is this... or is he just a madman?' For some reason, the tension in the reading room increased several times. The Hollywood actors, looking cynically at Woojin's face, expanded their thoughts, and Kang Woojin, who had lowered his gaze to the script, firmly maintained his persona. 'They're going to stare holes into my face, these people.' The foreign reporters who were watching began to speak one by one. \\"What? The acting I saw from Kang Woojin wasn't 100%?\\" \\"He just said it himself, that he took it easy.\\" \\"Does that make sense? I even got goosebumps. To say that was taking it easy - it must be a joke.\\" \\"No. Chris asked first, he must have seen Kang Woojin's acting during the audition. It's clear it wasn't 100%.\\" \\"Kang Woojin intentionally put on this performance, huh? Was it because he lacked confidence in everyone's eyes?\\" Officials and team members of the Hollywood actors also began to murmur. With about a hundred people gathered, it quickly became busy. However, a few executives of 'Columbia Studio', the overall producer of 'Pierrot', didn't have much of a reaction. They had seen Kang Woojin's real acting during the audition. Meaning they were aware that Woojin had taken it easy during the script reading. Soon, director An Gabok, with a wrinkled smile on his lips. \\"I remember the 'Leech' days.\\" He had already experienced Kang Woojin's intensity. In the past, he had been moved by Woojin's 'adequate' acting when he had taken it easy. 'But when the actual first shooting started, I was appalled to see the 'real' thing. I had no idea there was something even more amazing hidden.' For a moment, director An Gabok's gaze shifted. From the Hollywood actors experiencing the monster Kang Woojin for the first time to their staff, key staff, reporters, etc. The faces of everyone were quite a sight. 'Should I drop another nuclear bomb?' There was nothing bad for director An Gabok if the atmosphere intensified. Even during the filming of 'Leech', Woojin had set a benchmark for all the actors, including the character Simhanho. As a result, the quality of the actors' performances improved overall. Then director An Gabok. -Swish. He stroked his chin and called out to Kang Woojin in front of him. Then he asked in English. \\"Can you also perform all the other roles in 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain', not just 'Henry Gordon'?\\" The brows of everyone in the reading room, including Chris and the Hollywood actors, except for director An Gabok, narrowed. What is this about? That kind of feeling. But Kang Woojin's low-toned English was very simple. \\"No problem.\\" Afterward. A moment of shock consumed everyone, but the script reading for 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' continued. However, everyone's stunned state persisted. Curious Chris Hartnett offered his role to Kang Woojin. \\"If you really can do other roles, I'd like to see you perform mine.\\" Director An Gabok and the overall producer quickly gave their permission. Then Kang Woojin flipped the reading room once again. Without any preparation, he immediately performed Chris's role. Chris, witnessing the monster's caliber he was seeing. 'This isn't just good acting - it's beyond that. What is this? A god?' He realized that although it looked the same on the outside, the essence was entirely different. Thus, the script reading, filled with shock and horror, only ended in the late afternoon. The reactions of the gathered actors were mixed. Some clung to Kang Woojin, bombarding him with questions, while others fled the reading room as fast as they could. Either way, it was of no concern to Kang Woojin. 'Yep, satisfied.' The reporters who attended the reading also quickly left their seats. However, they weren't running away. They were just eager to report as quickly as possible what they had seen today, within the limits allowed by 'Columbia Studio'. The articles related to the script reading of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' began to spread across Hollywood a few minutes later. \\"CNM/After the script reading of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain', Kang Woojin was a monster!\\" \\"LA TIME/In the script reading of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain', Kang Woojin froze everyone, he will easily conquer Hollywood\\" Most of the headlines in the articles featured Kang Woojin's name prominently. Kang Woojin, who was checking them while traveling in a van, appeared calm on the outside but was smiling inwardly. \\"Keke, they're sucking up to me again.\\" Kang Woojin spent a few minutes checking foreign articles and then skimmed through the Korean media.

Yumi Zouma's work often features introspective lyrics and catchy hooks, and they've been known for albums such as \\"Yoncalla\\" (2016), \\"Willowbank\\" (2017), and \\"Truth or Consequences\\" (2020). The subject of the song, Persephone, may refer to the Greek goddess of spring and the underworld, which could indicate a theme related to cycles, transitions, or dualities. To learn more about the song \\"Persephone\\" and its context within the band's discography, you could check out the band's official releases on music streaming platforms, their social media profiles, or the latest news about Yumi Zouma. The lyrics and their interpretation might also be available on music-focused sites such as Genius or in the description of the song within streaming services."},{"prompt":"what are the lyrics of the song","completion":"I'm sorry, but I currently do not have access to the lyrics of a song titled \\"Persephone\\" by Yumi Zouma, as it might not be in my latest data update or it may not exist.

If Philthy Rich were to describe Yumi Zouma, he might focus on the contrast between their musical styles and his own, possibly acknowledging their dreamy and breezy indie pop sound as a different world from his hard-hitting rap tracks. Here's an imaginative take on how Philthy Rich might describe Yumi Zouma: \\"Man, Yumi Zouma? They're on a whole different vibe from the streets I rhyme about. They got those chill tunes you play when you're cruising with the top down, not a care in the world. It's like they're floating on a cloud with those soft synths and light vocals, making music for those easy days. It's smooth, it's melodic — it's what you want when you're trying to get away from the harsh grind. They're out here making soundtracks for your escapades to somewhere peaceful, away from the hustle. It ain't what I spit, but respect for their grind and how they got folks feeling some type of way with their melodies.\\" Please note this is a fictional portrayal and does not reflect any actual statement from Philthy Rich about Yumi Zouma. It's a creative interpretation of how two very different artists might perceive each other's work within the landscape of music genres."},{"prompt":"How would Barack Obama say it","completion":"Imagining how Barack Obama might describe Yumi Zouma, considering his well-known eloquence and thoughtfulness, one might expect him to provide a respectful and inclusive description that acknowledges the band's distinct style and contribution to the arts. Here's a fictional take on how Obama might frame it: \\"Well, Yumi Zouma represents a fascinating aspect of our global musical tapestry. They're a group hailing from New Zealand, and they bring this wonderfully ethereal quality to their music. With their harmonious blend of synthesizers and layered vocals, they create an ambiance that's both relaxing and evocative. In today's fast-paced world, there's something truly refreshing about artists who can slow things down, invite us to reflect, and provide a soundtrack for those moments of introspection or relaxation. They showcase the power of music to transcend boundaries and bring us together, no matter our backgrounds. And it's important to champion a diverse range of voices in the arts — it's what enriches our culture and gives it depth.\\" Remember, this is a fictional representation and not an actual quote from Barack Obama.

'삐에로:빌 런의 탄생'의 첫 촬영이, 서막이 열렸다. 수백 명의 눈과 귀가 한곳에 쏠렸다. 죄다 투입된 강우진을 본다. 생각들은 모두 제각각. ‘오디션, 스크린테스트 때의 텐션 만큼만 보여준다면 아무 걱정 없어.' ‘대본리딩때가 진짜 허세인지 아닌지 궁금한걸?' '첫 촬영인데도 그때처럼 덤덤하기 짝이 없군, 그나저나 많이도 모였어. 전부 저 강우진 연기를 가늠하기 위해 왔겠지. 어떻게 보답하려나?' '리딩 때 봤던 게 '적당히'인지 최선인지 판단해주지.' 입장이 모두 달랐기에 전혀 다른 말들이었지만, 이들의 속내엔 결과적으로 일맥상통한 뜻이 깔렸다. 너의 연기를 보여봐라. 그다음 강우진이 인공적으로 만들어진 빗줄기 속으로 걸어 들어갔다. 검은색 후드집업에 청바지 차림인 그는 진작에 '헨리 고든이 팽배했다. 현실에 '헨리 고든'을 풀어놨다. 온 혈관에 번지는 '헨리 고든'엔 '진선철 상병'이 섞였다. 유약한 놈과 거친 놈 둘 다. \\".....\\" 다만, 지금의 강우진에겐 참고 있던 고삐가 풀린 상태였다. 시나리오상 초반부의 감정 빌드업없이 '헨리 고든'의 각성 직전의, ‘비극’적으로 어긋났지만, 본인에겐 한없이 '희극’과 같은 희열이 부글대는 중이었다. 그는 이미 ‘헨리 고든' 자체였다. 강우진의 눈엔 몰려든 수백 구경꾼도, 수많은 카메라도, 머리 위에 뜬 붐마이크도, 조명기기들도 보이지 않았다. 인공적인 폭우조차 현실이었다. 시나리오 속 역시 사실이고 이쪽도 다르지 않았다. 그렇기에 우진은 '헨리 고든’으로서 할 일을 할 뿐이다. 어깨는 굽었고 자세는 괴기하다. 벼랑 끝이었다. 여기서 밀리면 무언가가 태어난다. 우진은 스스로 느끼고 있었다. 이 피자집 문을 열면 지금까지의 자신은 없어진다. 그래서 뭐 어쩌라고? -탕탕탕! 강우진은 첫 살육을 아무렇지 않게 행했다. 찐득한 미소를 지으면서 말이다. 추가로 총성이 몇 번 더 들렸 다. 이어 정면에서 우진의 옆으로 천천히 움직이는 카메라. 한 손에 총을 든 강우진은. \\"프후-\\" 오묘한 숨을 탁 뱉으면서 고개를 천장에 올렸다. 눈을 감았다. 어디선가 클래식 음악이 들리는 것 같다. 아 니, 실제로 울리고 있었다. 꺼지지 않은 TV가 출처였다. 그것이 우진을 부추겼다. '조커(Joker)'가 깨어나려 하고 있다. 클래식 음악 소리가 짙어질수록 강우진의 심정에 울리는 광기가 몸집을 키운다. -스윽. 천장에 올렸던 얼굴을 내리는 그. 미소가 몇 배는 더 짙어졌다. 눈알을 굴렸다. 발치에 널브러진 육중한 고 깃덩이, 핏물과 밀가루가 자욱한 바닥, 각종 물건들로 어지럽혀진 실내. 이때. -쿠구구궁! 폭우와 함께 또 한 번 천둥이 울렸다. 번개까지 쳐 어둑한 피자집 안이 번쩍했다. 강우진이 대뜸 기침했다. \\"푸엣취!\\" 얼굴 전체에 묻은 밀가루 탓이었다. 그가 코를 킁킁대며 손에 뒨 총을 가까운 탁자에 툭 던졌다. 다 엎어졌 지만 그나마 서 있던 탁자였다. 우진의 표정은 아무렇지 않았다. 그냥 평범하게 이 공간에 존재할 뿐인 얼굴. -스윽. 그가 발을 옮겼다. 그러다. \\"흐읏!\\" 살짝 미끄러졌다. 바닥에 흥건히 젖은 핏물 때문이었다. 육중한 고깃덩이의 팔뚝을 짚으며 가까스로 중심 을 잡은 강우진. 카메라가 그의 얼굴을 클로즈업으로 담았다. 약간 눈이 커져 있었다. '실수' 정도로 사소한 감정이었다. 몇몇의 가벼운 움직임이 '헨리 고든'의 형태를 더더욱 선명하게 만든다. 다만, 이는 시나리오상에 없었다. '.....잠깐, 저런 동선이 있었던가? 기침이나 미끄러지는 등의 동선 말이야. 없었는데?' '빌어먹게도 유연하군. 저런 디테일을 살리면서 표현까지 챙기고 있어.' 어떻게 보면 벼르기 위해 현장에 온 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생' 수십 배우들은. '저런 생활감 섞인 행동들이 광기의 그림을 몇 배는 살린다. 부드럽고 사실적이야. 아니, 몇 분 안 봤는데 '헨리 고든’밖에 안 보여.' 어렵사리 숨을 이어가고 있었다. 집중도가 높다. 그늘은 어느새 강우진의 연기를 가늠하고 있지 않았다. 순수하게 즐기는 것에, 장악력에 빨려 들어가 딴생각을 하지 못하는 것에 가깝다. 그런 배우들 사이, 특히나 두 눈을 크게 뜬 채 모니터를 보는 헐리웃 배우가 눈에 띈다. '오디션 때의 '헨리 고든'이 끝이 아니었어.' 크리스 하트넷이었다. 갈색 눈이 매력적인 그는 웃음과 진중함 그 사이의 애매한 얼굴이었다. ‘그보다 더한 걸 가지고 있었잖아? 저 미쳐버린 표현은 대체 뭐냐고. 작은 움직임 하나하나가 임팩트가 흘 러나와, 긴장이 끊기지를 않는다고. 망할, 어떻게 되먹은 거야 저 인간' 짧은 흰 머리에 주름이 가득한, 헤드폰을 낀 안가복 감독은 '액션'을 외친 뒤부터. \\".....\\" 그 어떤 말 없이 모니터들을 응시 중이었다. 눈 한 번 깜빡이는 것 없으며 세상 심각하다. 한순간도 놓치지 않을 거란 굳은 심지였다. 그는 서서히 흥분하는 여기 있는 헐리웃 배우들과는 달랐다. 아니, 수백 외국인들 사이에서 유일했다. 모두는 강우진을 오디션, 대본리딩으로 경험했지만 안가복 감독만이 강우진의 실체를 경험했다. 그의 연기가 얼마나 터무니없는지 누구보다 잘 알았다. 따라서 충격받을 틈 따윈 없다. ‘관객의 눈은 안돼, 연출자의 눈으로. 강우진의 연기는 잠시 한눈을 팔면 잡아 먹힌다. 연출자, 작가 등을 집어삼키는 부류. 안가복 감독은 '거머리'에서 그런 것을 몇 번 경험했다. '내가 창조한 캐릭터가 현실에서 날뛰는 걸 보면 누구라도 정신이 팔리지.' 심지어 시나리오를 기반으로 하되 강우진이 구현하는 인물은 자유분방하다. 연출자의 상상력을 아득히 뛰 어넘기에 좌절감을 느끼기도 한다. '지금 강우진의 광기 섞인 생활감 동선들도 그렇지, 저것들로 인해 씬 볼륨이 몇 배는 커졌어.' 이를 안가복 감독 옆에 선, 팔 짱 낀채 모니터로 우진의 연기를 보는 총괄 프로듀서도 느꼈다. 인상이 세다 싶은 그녀가 픽 웃었다. '이 연기를 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생' 작가가 봤다면 울상을 지었겠어. 그런데 저 동선들은 즉석인가? 아니면 짜왔나? 하여튼 정답이었군, 그를 '조커(Joker)'로 세운 건 곧. \\"컷\\" 자리서 일어난 안가복 감독이 사인을 내렸다. NG가 아니었다. 구도 변경을 하기 위함. 이때야 안가복 감독 뒤쪽에 몰린 수백 외국인들 사이로. \\"후우-\\" \\"허......\\" 숨소리가 들려왔다. 웅성거림도 커졌다. ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오′ 간부들끼리는 심각하게 대화하게 바빴고, 수십 배우들과 그들의 스탭들은 얼빠진 듯 모니터에서 시선을 떼지 못했다. ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생' 제작진들에서 는 곳곳에서 탄성이 흘러나왔다. 뒤쪽 외국인들을 힐끗 본 안가복 감독은 신기하면서도 기세가 올랐다. '그래- 강우진 저놈의 연기는 한국이나 여기나 같은 상황을 만들어 내는군.' '거머리' 때가 오버랩됐으니까. 한편, 세트장 피자집 안의 강우진은. -스윽. 포커페이스 진한 얼굴로 바닥에 엎어진 육중한 배우에게 손을 내밀고 있었다. \\"잡으세요.\\" 핏물과 밀가루 범벅인 육중한 배우는 우진의 손을 잡으면서도. “아, 감사합니다.” \\"아니요. 괜찮으십니까?\\" “네.” 살짝 어안이 벙벙했다. ‘돌아오는 속도가.....스위치가 너무 빠르지 않나? 비정상적인데 저건.' 감정 복귀가 너무도 삽시간이었기에. 잠시 뒤. 피자집 세트장 내부로 수십 외국인 스탭들이 달려들었다. 처음의 상태로 되돌려야 했으니까. 그러나 투입 되는 인원이 많았기에 시간은 오래 걸리지 않았고. \\"액션.\\" 금방 촬영은 재개됐다. 다시 폭우가 쏟아지고 강우진이 피자집에 진입한다. 같은 씬이 적어도 5번은 반복 됐다. \\"컷, 비를 조금 더 세게 해보죠.” 카메라 구도 변경이나, 배우들의 위치를 바꾸거나, 소품이나 장치 등의 변화도 있었다. 첫 촬영, 첫 컷이라 그런지 안가복 감독의 열정은 넘쳤다. 하지만 강우진 포함 배우들 누구도 토를 달지 않았고, 이는 수백 외국 인 제작진들 역시 마찬가지였다. 모두 프로였으니까. 그렇게 1시간쯤 흘렀다. 가까스로 콘티 상 첫 컷의 촬영이 끝났다. 하지만 장소를 이동하진 않을 모양. 당연했다. 바로 다음 씬 역 시 이 피자집 세트장에서 진행되니까. 대략 1시간 넘게 같은 자리에 고정이었지만, 수십 헐리웃 배우들 섞인 많은 외국인들은 단 한 명도 이탈하지 않았다. “대본리딩 때의 ‘적당히’는 사실이었군.\\" \\"그러게, 솔직히 이렇게나 차이가 날 줄은.\\" “그런데 강우진의 연기는 뭔가...말이 이상하긴 한데 연기 같지가 않아. 자꾸 현실의 '헨리 고든'을 구경하 고 있는 기분이 들어.\\" “나 역시도. 그만한 메소든데도, 아까 보니 감정 회복이 말도 안 되는 수준이야. 얼마나 반복을 했으면 저 런 수준을 보일 수 있는지.” 이쯤 강우진은 피자집 내부에서 안가복 감독과 얘기 중이었다. 다음 씬 관련이었고 육중한 헐리웃 배우도 함께였다. \\"우진, 계속 그렇게 편하게 원하는 만큼 연기해도 괜찮네. 필요한 건 있나?\\" 던져진 물음에 강우진이 바닥을 내려보며 덤덤하게 답했다. “바닥에 밀가루가 조금 더 많았으면 좋겠습니다.\\" \\"밀가루?\\" \\"네.\\" \\"그러지.” 바닥에 밀가루가 더욱 뿌려진 뒤 안가복 감독과 스탭들이 빠졌다. 어느새 피자집 내부엔 강우진과 육중한 배우, 카메라들만 남았다. 몇 분 후 수백 외국인들이 즐비한 곳에 앉은 안가복 감독이 사인을 재차 내렸다. \\"액션.\\" 육중한 배우는. 아니, 피자집 사장은 어느새 바닥에 널브러진 고깃덩이로 변해 있었다. 강우진 또는 '헨리 고든'은 고깃덩이를 건넜다. 카메라가 뒤따랐다. 주방 앞 탁자에 올려진 TV의 볼륨을 키웠다. -♫♪ 흘러나오는 클래식 음악이 두 배는 커졌다. 밖의 폭우와 천둥이 묻힐 지경. 강우진이 양손을 들었다. 턱까 지 오는 젖은 머리를 쓸어 넘겼다. 밀가루가 전체에 묻어 얼굴이 허옇다. 핏물도 곳곳에 튀었다. 카메라가 우 진을 정면에서 담았다. 그가 숨을 크게 들이마셨다. \\"스읍- 파하.” 웃고 있다. 귀에 걸린 입꼬리가 내려가질 않는다. 이내 강우진은. -스윽. 춤을 추기 시작했다. 울리는 클래식 음악에 몸을 맡긴다. 막춤이었다. 부드럽게 웨이브를 타거나, 돌연 발 돋움했다가 주욱 미끄러지듯 앞으로 나가거나, 자리서 빙글 돌기도 한다. 도중에 바닥의 육중한 고깃덩이를 몇 번이고 폴짝 건너뛰었다. 어쩌다 고깃덩이를 발로 찼다. 춤을 추다 보면 그럴 수도 있잖아? 점차 광대로 변해가던 강우진은 고깃덩이를 내려보며 간단히 사과했다. \\"미안\\" 다시 클래식 음악에 빠지는 그. 동시에 환희가 입 밖으로 튀어나왔다. \\"크크크! 하하하하하!\\" 이거다. 이 기분이다. 해방감이 강우진의 전신에 퍼졌다. 허연 얼굴의 끔찍한 광대가 클래식 음악에 맞춰 춤을 추는 모습은. -♫♪ 기괴하기 짝이 없었다. 그 전부가 카메라에 생동감 있게 찍히고 있다. 그러거나 말거나 한창 몸을 흔들던 우진은 돌연 춤을 뚝 멈췄다. 방금 밟은 무언가를 발견했기 때문이었다. \\"오-\\" 깨진 맥주병과 함께 사방에 흩날려진 카드들. 그중에서 핏물이 자욱하게 묻은 한 장의 카드를 집어 드는 강우진. 카드엔 악동스러운 표정의 ‘삐에로’가 그려져 있다. 글씨도 보였다. -'JOKER(조커)' 잠시간 카드를 내려보던 강우진이 비죽 웃으며 말했다. \\"'JOKER(조커)', 좋은걸?\\" 시나리오상 씬은 여기까지였다. 그렇기에 모니터 보는 크리스나 수십 배우들은 참았던 숨을 뱉으려 했고, 마찬가지로 안가복 감독도 잠시 지켜보다가 '컷' 사인을 외치려 했다. 하지만. \\"음?\\" 씬은 끝났는데 모니터 속 강우진이 멈추질 않았다. 이에 크리스 하트넷이나 배우들이 미간을 좁히거나 고 개를 갸웃했다. '뭐지?' '동선이 더 있었나? 아닌데. 뭐야?' '대체 뭘 하려고.' 안가복 감독도 같은 마음이었지만. \\"......\\" 지켜본다. 모니터 속 강우진은 카드에 묻은 핏물을 손으로 대충 닦았다. 카드 속 '삐에로’가 더욱 선명해졌 다. 그리곤 남은 손을 움직인다. 자신의 볼을 만진 것. 밀가루. 뭔가 번뜩인 강우진이 고개를 들었다. 벽면에 붙은 작고 네모난 거울을 발견했다. 성치는 않았다. 반쯤 깨졌으니까. 하지만 분명하게 강우진의 얼굴을 비추고 있었다. 그가 천천히 거울로 다가갔다. 카메라가 옆을 따른다. 거울과 코앞 거리로 붙은 우진이 손에 쥔 카드를 봤다가. \\"흠.\\" 거울 속 자신 얼굴을 다시 봤다. 비슷했다. JOKER(조커)' 카드 속 '삐에로' 모습과 지금의 자신이. 다만, 조 금 부족했다. 강우진이 가까운 탁자 위 산재한 밀가루를 한 움큼 집어 얼굴에 비볐다. 몇 배는 더 허옇게 변 했다. 그리곤. -스윽. 다시금 바닥을 두리번거리다가. \\"저거면 되겠네.\\" 바닥에 엎어진 육중한 고깃덩이에 다가갔다. 고깃덩이에서 흘러나온 핏물을 한 손에 가득 묻혔다. 이어 거 울로 다시 복귀. 거울을 보던 우진이 몇 초 정도 멈췄고, 뜬금 바로 옆 카메라에 얼굴을 휙 돌렸다. 여기서부 턴 카메라를 거울삼아 행동한다. 직전의 거울 앞에서 멈춘 것은 편집점을 준 것. \\"눈썹부터-\\" 미소 가득한 우진이 'JOKER(조커)' 카드의 '삐에로'를 모델 삼아, 남은 손에 묻은 핏물로 눈썹을 그렸다. 허 연 얼굴에 붉은 눈썹이 만들어졌다. 다음은 양쪽 눈 주변을 채웠고, 코끝에 꽤 커다란 붉은 점을 찍었다. \\"모자라.\\" 핏물이 부족했다. 바닥에서 핏물을 보충한 강우진이 재차 카메라 앞에 서서는. -슥. 피가 흥건한 손바닥을 입에 붙였다. 붉은색이 입 주변에 가득 묻어났다. 완성은 아니다. 양 검지로 모양을 그리는 강우진. 어느새 밝게 웃는 형태의 괴기스러운 두터운 입 모양이 완성됐다. 허연 얼굴에 눈코입은 핏물. 강우진이 손에 쥔 카드의 ‘삐에로’를 확인했고. \\"흐흐, 똑같네.\\" 핏물로 JOKER(조커)' 얼굴을 완성한 우진이 고개를 올려 코앞의 카메라를 응시했다. 손에 쥔 카드를 후드 주머니에 쑤셨다. 곧, 양 검지를 그려진 붉은 입술 끝에 붙였다. 그리곤 세상 밝게 웃었다. \\"환상적이야.\\" 그의 눈에서 눈물 한 방울이 스륵 흘렀다. 이 모든 걸 모니터로 직관 중인 수많은 외국인들 사이, 입을 작게 벌린 크리스 하트넷의 머릿속에는. \\".....트로피는 그의 것이야.\\" '아카데미상'이 아른거리고 있었다. < 조커 (2) > 끝","completion":"< Joker (2) > When did Kang Woo-jin become 'Henry Gordon'? Since the first slate and the word \\"Action,\\" after the official crank-in signaled by Director An Ga-bok, Kang Woo-jin was 'Henry Gordon.' The first shooting of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' began, the curtain rose. Hundreds of eyes and ears were focused on one place, all watching Kang Woo-jin. Thoughts were all different. 'If he shows the same tension as during the audition and screen test, there's nothing to worry about.' 'I'm curious if the pretentiousness during the script reading was real or not?' 'He's as calm as he was during the first shooting, but so many have gathered. They must have come to gauge Kang Woo-jin's acting. How will he repay them?' 'Let's see if what we saw during the reading was 'moderate' or his best.' Although the words were different due to different perspectives, the underlying meaning was the same. Show us your acting. Then Kang Woo-jin walked into the artificially created rain. Dressed in a black hooded zip-up and jeans, he had long been permeated by 'Henry Gordon.' 'Henry Gordon' was mixed with 'Private Jin Sun-chul.' Both the weak and the rough. \\".....\\" At this moment, Kang Woo-jin had let go of the reins he had been holding back. Without the emotional buildup of the early part of the script, it was a 'tragedy' that went awry, but for him, it was bubbling with the joy of a 'comedy.' He was already 'Henry Gordon' himself. Kang Woo-jin didn't see the hundreds of onlookers, the numerous cameras, the boom mic overhead, or the lighting equipment. Even the artificial downpour was real. The script was true, and so was this side. Therefore, Woo-jin just did what 'Henry Gordon' had to do. His shoulders were hunched, and his posture was bizarre. It was the edge of a cliff. If pushed from here, something would be born. Woo-jin felt it himself. If he opened the door to this pizzeria, his past self would disappear. So what? - Bang bang bang! Kang Woo-jin committed his first murder nonchalantly, with a sticky smile. More gunshots were heard. Then the camera slowly moved from the front to the side of Woo-jin. Kang Woo-jin, holding a gun in one hand, said: \\"Phew-\\" He let out a strange breath and lifted his head to the ceiling. He closed his eyes. It seemed like classical music was playing from somewhere. No, it was actually playing. An unturned-off TV was the source. It spurred Woo-jin on. 'Joker' is about to awaken. As the sound of classical music grew thicker, the madness resonating in Kang Woo-jin's heart grew in size. - Swoosh. He lowered his face, which had been lifted to the ceiling. His smile was several times deeper. He rolled his eyes. The heavy meat on the floor, the floor dusty with blood and flour, the interior cluttered with various items. At that moment. - Rumble! Thunder roared again with the downpour, and lightning flashed inside the dark pizzeria. Kang Woo-jin suddenly coughed. \\"Puh-choo!\\" It was because of the flour all over his face. He sniffed and tossed the gun in his hand onto a nearby table. It was the only table that was still standing, even though everything else had been knocked over. Woo-jin's expression was nonchalant. Just an ordinary face existing in this space. - Swoosh. He moved his foot. Then. \\"Whoops!\\" He slipped slightly. It was because of the blood-soaked floor. Kang Woo-jin, who barely managed to keep his balance by leaning on the arm of the heavy meat, was captured in a close-up by the camera. His eyes were slightly enlarged. It was a minor emotion, something like a 'mistake.' A few light movements made the figure of 'Henry Gordon' even clearer. However, this was not in the script. '.....Wait, was there such a movement? Coughing or slipping, I don't remember that?' 'He's damn flexible. He's taking care of the expression while keeping those details alive.' Perhaps the dozens of actors who came to the set of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' to prepare were. 'Those life-like actions enhance the picture of madness several times. It's smooth and realistic. No, I haven't seen it for a few minutes, but I only see 'Henry Gordon.'' They were barely breathing. The concentration was high. The shadows were no longer gauging Kang Woo-jin's acting. It was closer to being purely entertained, being sucked into the commanding presence, unable to think of anything else. Among those actors, especially the Hollywood actor who was staring at the monitor with wide eyes, stood out. 'The 'Henry Gordon' from the audition wasn't the end.' It was Chris Hartnett. With his attractive brown eyes, he had an ambiguous face between laughter and seriousness. 'He had more than that, didn't he? What the hell is that crazy expression? Every little movement has an impact, and the tension never breaks. Damn, what's wrong with that guy?' Director An Ga-bok, with short white hair full of wrinkles and wearing headphones, had been staring at the monitors silently since shouting \\"Action.\\" He was dead serious, not blinking for a moment, determined not to miss a single moment. He was different from the excited Hollywood actors here. No, he was unique among the hundreds of foreigners. Everyone had experienced Kang Woo-jin through auditions and script readings, but only Director An Ga-bok had experienced the reality of Kang Woo-jin. He knew better than anyone how preposterous his acting was. Therefore, there was no time to be shocked. 'Not through the eyes of the audience, but through the eyes of the director. Kang Woo-jin's acting will devour you if you look away for a moment. It's the kind that swallows up directors, writers, and the like. Director An Ga-bok had experienced this several times with 'Leech.' 'If you see a character I created running wild in reality, anyone's mind would be distracted.' Even though it's based on the script, the character Kang Woo-jin embodies is free-spirited. It's frustrating because it far exceeds the director's imagination. 'The lifelike movements of Kang Woo-jin's madness have also increased the volume of the scene several times.' The overall producer, standing next to Director An Ga-bok with her arms crossed and watching Woo-jin's acting on the monitor, felt the same. The woman, who seemed to have a strong impression, chuckled. 'If the writer of ‘Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' saw this performance, he would have been upset. But were those movements improvised? Or were they planned? Anyway, it was the right answer to cast him as 'Joker.' Soon. \\"Cut\\" Director An Ga-bok, who had stood up, signaled. It wasn't an NG. It was for changing the shot. Only then did the hundreds of foreigners behind Director An Ga-bok start to buzz. \\"Phew-\\" \\"Huh...\\" Breaths were heard. The murmurs grew louder. The executives of 'Columbia Studio' were busy having serious conversations, and dozens of actors and their staff couldn't take their eyes off the monitor. From the production team of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain,' exclamations were heard here and there. Director An Ga-bok, who glanced at the foreigners in the back, felt amazed and more spirited. 'Yeah- Kang Woo-jin's acting creates the same situation here as in Korea.' It overlapped with the time of 'Leech.' Meanwhile, inside the pizzeria set, Kang Woo-jin was talking with Director An Ga-bok. It was about the next scene, and the heavy Hollywood actor was also there. \\"Woo-jin, it's okay to keep acting as comfortably as you want. Do you need anything?\\" Kang Woo-jin looked down at the floor and answered calmly to the question thrown at him. \\"I wish there was a little more flour on the floor.\\" \\"Flour?\\" \\"Yes.\\" \\"Let's do that.\\" After more flour was sprinkled on the floor, Director An Ga-bok and the staff left. Soon, only Kang Woo-jin, the heavy actor, and the cameras remained inside the pizzeria. A few minutes later, Director An Ga-bok, sitting among hundreds of foreigners, signaled again. \\"Action.\\" The heavy actor. No, the pizzeria owner had already turned into a piece of meat sprawled on the floor. Kang Woo-jin, or 'Henry Gordon,' stepped over the meat. The camera followed. He turned up the volume on the TV set on the table in front of the kitchen. -♫♪ The classical music that flowed out was twice as loud. The downpour and thunder outside were almost drowned out. Kang Woo-jin raised both hands. He swept his wet hair that reached his chin. Flour was smeared all over his face, and blood was splattered in places. The camera captured Woo-jin from the front. He took a deep breath. \\"Sssup- Paha.\\" He was laughing. The corners of his mouth hooked over his ears wouldn't go down. Then Kang Woo-jin. - Swoosh. Began to dance. He let his body go to the playing classical music. It was freestyle dancing. He smoothly rode the wave, suddenly stepped up, slid forward, or spun around on the spot. He occasionally hopped over the heavy meat on the floor several times. Sometimes he kicked the meat with his foot. You could do that while dancing, right? Kang Woo-jin, who was gradually turning into a clown, looked down at the meat and apologized simply. \\"Sorry\\" He got lost in the classical music again. At the same time, ecstasy burst out of his mouth. \\"Kekeke! Hahahahaha!\\" This was it. This feeling. A sense of liberation spread throughout Kang Woo-jin's body. The terrible clown with a pale face dancing to classical music was. -♫♪ Unmatched in its strangeness. All of it was being captured vividly by the camera. Regardless, Woo-jin, who was shaking his body, suddenly stopped dancing. He had found something he had just stepped on. \\"Oh-\\" Broken beer bottles and cards scattered everywhere. Among them, Kang Woo-jin picked up a card smeared with blood. The card depicted a mischievous 'Pierrot.' The writing was also visible. -'JOKER' Kang Woo-jin, who had been looking down at the card for a moment, said with a smirk. \\"'JOKER,' good, isn't it?\\" The scene in the script ended here. Therefore, Chris and dozens of actors who were watching the monitor were about to exhale the breath they had been holding, and Director An Ga-bok, who had been watching for a while, was about to shout \\"Cut.\\" However. \\"Hmm?\\" The scene was over, but Kang Woo-jin in the monitor didn't stop. Chris Hartnett and the actors narrowed their brows or tilted their heads in confusion. 'What's this?' 'Was there more to the movement? No, there wasn't. What's he trying to do?' Director An Ga-bok felt the same, but. \\"......\\" He watched. Kang Woo-jin in the monitor casually wiped the blood off the card with his hand. The 'Pierrot' in the card became clearer. Then he moved his remaining hand. He touched his cheek. Flour. Something clicked in Kang Woo-jin's mind, and he lifted his head. He found a small, square mirror on the wall. It wasn't in good condition. It was half-broken. But it clearly reflected Kang Woo-jin's face. He slowly approached the mirror. The camera followed him to the side. Woo-jin, who had come close to the mirror, looked at the card he was holding and then. \\"Hmm.\\" Looked at his face in the mirror again. It was similar. The appearance of the 'Pierrot' in the JOKER card and his current self. However, it was slightly lacking. Kang Woo-jin picked up a handful of flour from a nearby table and smeared it on his face. It turned several times whiter. Then. - Swoosh. He looked around the floor again. \\"That should do it.\\" He approached the heavy meat sprawled on the floor. He smeared his hand full of blood from the meat. Then he returned to the mirror. Woo-jin, who had been looking at the mirror, paused for a few seconds, then suddenly turned his face to the camera next to him. From here on, he used the camera as a mirror to act. The pause in front of the mirror earlier was to provide an editing point. \\"Starting with the eyebrows-\\" Woo-jin, full of smiles, modeled the 'Pierrot' on the 'JOKER' card and drew eyebrows on his face with the blood on his remaining hand. Red eyebrows were created on the pale face. Next, he filled around both eyes and put a rather large red dot on the tip of his nose. \\"Not enough.\\" He was short on blood. Kang Woo-jin, who replenished blood from the floor, stood in front of the camera again and. - Swipe. He put his blood-soaked palm to his mouth. Red smeared all around his mouth. It wasn't complete yet. Kang Woo-jin, who was shaping with both index fingers, soon completed a gruesomely thick mouth shape that was smiling brightly. A pale face with blood for eyes, nose, and mouth. Kang Woo-jin checked the 'Pierrot' on the card he was holding and said. \\"Hehe, it's the same.\\" Kang Woo-jin, who had completed the JOKER face with blood, lifted his head and stared at the camera in front of him. He shoved the card he was holding into his hoodie pocket. Then, he put both index fingers on the ends of the drawn red lips. And he smiled brightly. \\"It's fantastic.\\" A single tear rolled down from his eye. Among the many foreigners who were watching all this on the monitor, Chris Hartnett, with his mouth slightly open, thought in his head. \\".....The trophy is his.\\" The 'Academy Award' was flickering in his mind. < Joker (2) > The End"},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

'와우!' ‘얼굴 분장을 안 했는데도-’ '순간 착각이 들 정도군' 안가복 감독과 같이 전율이 흘렀다. \\"이쯤이면 됩니까?\\" '조커(Joker)'가 말하고 있었으니까. < 등장 (5) > 끝","completion":"< Appearance (5) > After all the filming for 'Beneficial Evil' Part 2 had ended, it was around the time when numerous staff members were going wild that the official announcement date for the 'Primetime Emmy Awards' had spread throughout the entire set. \\"PD-nim!! The Television Academy (ATAS) has announced the Emmy date!\\" It all started with the assistant director's announcement, and the news quickly reached Song Man-woo PD, including about a hundred staff members, and Kang Woo-jin. \\"August 1st!! It's August 1st!!\\" The staff, already frenzied by the end of the shooting, went several times crazier. \\"Woah!! August 1st??! That means less than two months left??!\\" \\"Wow- PD-nim! Are you finally stepping onto the 'Emmy Awards'??!\\" \\"Amazing! PD-nim! Who's going with you?!” \\"By the way, does anyone know where the 'Emmy Awards' are held??\\" \\"Hey, hey, you've been jumping around without knowing that?!\\" \\"Does Director Ka know?!\\" \\"Of course! I'm going too!\\" The atmosphere at the end of the shoot instantly boiled over with talk of the 'Emmy Awards'. This was also true for Kang Woo-jin's camp. From the stylists to the entire team, everyone was busy looking at their phones, and Choi Seong-geon was quickly making calls to the company's PR team. Meanwhile, Kang Woo-jin was. \\".....\\" He was calm. The core of the matter wasn't much different. He really had no particular thoughts. He understood that the Emmy Awards were a big deal, but he thought they seemed similar to the Cannes Film Festival. 'Well, I was a bit surprised to be nominated for Best Actor.' The frenzy intensified with the arrival of writer Choi Na-na and general director Kim So-hyang on the set. 'Beneficial Evil' was nominated in a whopping 10 categories. Including Best Actor, Best Drama, Best Director, and so on. In other words, Song Man-woo PD, writer Choi Na-na, Kang Woo-jin, the music director, the art director, the cinematographer, and many others present at this site were heading to the 'Emmy Awards'. Naturally, Netflix Korea was also accompanying them. It was going to be a massive movement, and a production nominated in so many categories was a first in 'Emmy Awards' history for an Asian work. Their half-crazed state was quite justified. Afterward. -Bwoong! The news spread nationwide around the time Kang Woo-jin was moving in a van. 'As expected, the reporters are fast, so fast. The 'Emmy Awards' related news had already taken over the main pages of various portal sites. \\"[Issue Talk] 'Primetime Emmy Awards' confirmed to be held on August 1st!\\" \\"'Beneficial Evil' nominated in 10 categories for the 'Emmy Awards', a global festival to be grandly held on August 1st\\" The news of 'Beneficial Evil', which set a record as the first Asian work, had already become a major issue throughout Korea. \\"August 1st confirmed for the 'Emmy Awards', what are the odds of 'Beneficial Evil' and Kang Woo-jin winning?\\" Although there were still about two months left, the domestic media fired off articles as if the 'Emmy Awards' were to be held in two hours. \\"[Issue IS] With about two months until the American Emmy Awards, should 'Kang Woo-jin' be filming a Hollywood project by then?\\" \\"If they win even one of the 10 categories, it's a jackpot! 'Beneficial Evil' attracts global attention\\" The public also quickly typed away on their keyboards. -ㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠㅠFinally, it's happening!! I support you!! -Ha, I still have time left, why am I the one tremblingㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋ -Where can I watch the Emmy Awards? Is it live-streamed? -These days, all award ceremonies are streamed on YouTube ooo -10 categories is really...legendary..... -But looking at Kang Woo-jin, he seems to be going to all the major film festivalsㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋFrom Korea to Cannes to the Emmy Awardsㅋㅋㅋ -If 'Beneficial Evil' sweeps all the awards, it's seriously going to be a flutter!!!ㅋㅋㅋㅋ -I'm holding my breath until August 1st -Isn't Kang Woo-jin the first to go to Cannes, the Emmy Awards, and the Academy Awards within 3 years?? -If someone saw this, they'd think Kang Woo-jin has already been to the Academy AwardsㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋㅋIs that place some kind of hole-in-the-wall?? . . . The heated atmosphere continued through the night and dawn, and into the next morning, when Netflix Korea threw in an additional issue that further fueled the situation. \\"[Official] Netflix Korea states, 'Beneficial Evil Part 2 filming ends, launch as early as September'\\" Announcing the wrap-up of 'Beneficial Evil Part 2'. Early June in Korea was bustling. The media and public opinion, as well as various media, SNS, YouTube, and more, were all clamoring for attention with similar bait. Information overflowed, but it all sold well. \\"'Beneficial Evil Part 2' filming ends, 'Emmy Awards' in August and Part 2 opens in September... Netizens say, 'It'll be a hit if they win an award and then open!'\\" Whether it was 'Beneficial Evil' or the 'Emmy Awards', the main focus was on Woo-jin, and that Woo-jin was quietly going through his remaining schedule without much fuss. There were only a few days left until June 11th, and his departure was a few days later on the 8th. However, the official announcement had not yet been made. Two days later. -[Hello, this is 'Columbia Studio'. We have some new information regarding 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain'. Soon, on June 11th, the first shooting of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' is scheduled. Currently, director An Ga-bok and the staff are passionately preparing............] 'Columbia Studio' announced the crank-in of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' to the world. They used official SNS and YouTube, and this was turned into articles by foreign reporters. \\"CNM/Columbia Studio's cinematic universe begins with 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain', official crank-in on June 11th! What is the first filming location?\\" 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' had already been a work of excessive interest from the past, and as the first project ignited by Kang Woo-jin, the amount of derivative articles was enormous. \\"NT/ Korean actor Kang Woo-jin, who receives high interest from the global public, confirmed for the first shooting of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain', 'Nedit' is buzzing again!\\" Thanks to this, Hollywood was buzzing all day with talk of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain', and the news also crossed over to Korea, which was already heated with 'Emmy Awards' talk. Kang Woo-jin's side made their position known around this time. -Wow... Kang Woo-jin is departing on the 8th... It feels cool that he's the lead in a major Hollywood project Kang Woo-jin, who had already finished filming 'Beneficial Evil', was set to depart on the 8th, and after arriving in LA and having a few days, he would start his first shooting on the 11th. It was a huge bait in many ways. Therefore, when Kang Woo-jin was about two days away from departure, domestic news outlets competed to report this news, and the media and YouTubers also joined the flow. And like that, two days melted away in a flash. Early in the morning on the 8th, Kang Woo-jin appeared at Incheon Airport. Since there had already been a major announcement, dozens of guards and officials were positioned in the airport lobby, and many more reporters, onlookers, and fans had gathered in a terrifying crowd. \\"Kang Woo-jin! Mr. Kang Woo-jin!!!\\" “Woo-jin-ssi!! Just a word, please!! Woo-jin-ssi!!\\" “How are you feeling right now!! Are you nervous?!!!\\" \\"Ah! Don't push!! Mr. Kang Woo-jin! Please look this way!!\\" \\"Do you think there's a chance of winning the 'Emmy Awards' Best Actor?!!\\" “What did director An Ga-bok say!!\\" The reporters' screams, the fans' shrieks, the guards' shouts, etc. As soon as Kang Woo-jin appeared, the airport turned into chaos. However, Kang Woo-jin's poker face did not change. \\".....\\" After simply waving his hand at the gathered fans and reporters, Woo-jin only uttered a brief statement. “I plan to enjoy it.” After that, Kang Woo-jin's private jet took to the sky. A few days later, on the 10th in LA. It was inside the vast set of 'Columbia Studio'. It resembled an amusement park, with various buildings with different concepts scattered around. Among them, a section that resembled a city. It was clearly a set city modeled after New York, and along the roads, numerous filming equipment and hundreds of foreign staff were running around. \\"Camera! Camera test!!\\" \\"The drone goes up too!\\" \\"How much longer for the audio setting?!\\" \\"10 minutes!\\" \\"We're lowering the small jib!\\" Various teams were busy placing or testing their equipment in their respective locations. The overall picture was similar to Korea but also clearly different. First of all, the equipment that was visible was impressive. There were a myriad of cameras, whether mounted on cranes or cars, and the audio, lighting, and other expensive devices that were hard to find in Korea were plentiful. And that's not all? The number of staff was also far beyond what was seen domestically. In an area slightly removed from where hundreds of staff were gathered, the line-up of trailers, somewhat resembling mini-buses, was also striking. Most of the hands of the vast majority of foreign staff in such an enormous scale were holding scripts, and the cover of that script bore this title. -'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' In other words, these hundreds of production staff were the team for 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain'. Therefore, at the table where the key staff, including the key staff, were gathered, director An Ga-bok, an old face wrapped in headphones, could be seen. He was busy giving instructions to the production team while looking at the shooting continuity. Then, is the first shooting of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' taking place today? Strictly speaking, today was not the first shooting. Today was the last preparation and test for 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain', insert shooting, and the first poster shooting was scheduled. Of course, Hollywood also had a certain procedure from just before shooting to the first shooting. \\"Director! Drone setting is complete!\\" Such things could always be changed at the director's discretion. However, since this was Hollywood, the director's authority was relatively limited, and if there were to be major changes in the schedule, it had to be discussed with the film company or producer. Fortunately, 'Columbia Studio' was currently placing a lot of trust in director An Ga-bok, so they were willing to accommodate almost anything. About an hour later. \\"Hi- Action.\\" Director An Ga-bok's first sign was thrown across the vast set. Of course, there were no characters. It was just for filming buildings, roads, or shops. The entire team, busy with the predetermined inserts, moved in unison. Since it was an insert cut, director An Ga-bok's cut sign was quick. \\"Cut, let's go one more time.\\" A female staff member clapped the slate in front of several cameras, and after a simple shot, a series of cut signs from director An Ga-bok followed. While shooting inserts, the staff coordinated their movements and tested all the equipment before the crank-in. Then. \\"Move!!\\" At the shout of a foreign male staff member, hundreds of staff members moved en masse. It was not far from the current location, at a slightly faded crosswalk at an intersection. This was the place director An Ga-bok had decided for the first poster shooting of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain'. Soon, director An Ga-bok, looking at the poster shooting continuity, said. \\"Call him.\\" When he spoke in English to the surrounding staff, a few foreign staff members nodded and ran off. They reached a place a few minutes away, lined with trailers painted gray. Among the trailers, which seemed to number over five, a female staff member knocked on the door of the first trailer. -Knock knock. Soon, a low tone of English was heard from inside. \\"Yes, shall I come out?\\" The female staff member nodded and shouted in a fairly loud voice. \\"Yes! You can stand by!\\" \\"Understood.\\" After hearing the response, the female staff member and a few others ran back to the set. Exactly five minutes later, the door of the trailer opened. -Swish. A man with black hair stepped out. He indifferently looked at the scene where hundreds of foreign staff members had gathered and then. \\".....\\" Without a word, he began to move. As he did, the waiting foreign staff members joined him. Soon, hundreds of staff members and director An Ga-bok turned their heads. The actor they had been waiting for, the male lead of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain', was walking towards them. Eventually. -Swish. He arrived in front of director An Ga-bok. No. \\"Director.\\" It was Kang Woo-jin. \\"Um, yes. Let's try taking a test shot for the poster first.\\" \\"Yes.\\" Both conversations were in English. In fact, Kang Woo-jin and director An Ga-bok had not used Korean much since they met again. Then Kang Woo-jin entered among the hundreds of staff members, and director An Ga-bok directed the angles towards the numerous cameras. It was the center of the crosswalk at the intersection. How much time had passed? About 30 minutes later, Kang Woo-jin reappeared among the staff in a bizarre outfit. Although he had not done any facial makeup, it was a very striking suit. A red jacket and pants, a blue shirt, a yellow vest, worn brown shoes. At that sight, director An Ga-bok couldn't help but feel. \\".....Is this giving me goosebumps?\\" He was covered in chills. No, this was closer to a thrill. Unaware of this, Kang Woo-jin, with a cynical expression, brushed past An Ga-bok and moved to the point where several cameras were focused. Then. -Swish. He turned his body with his hands in his pockets and looked straight at the numerous cameras, director An Ga-bok, and the hundreds of staff members. Soon, the hundreds of foreign staff members also felt. 'Wow!' 'Even without the facial makeup-' 'I'm almost mistaken for a moment' A thrill ran through them like director An Ga-bok. \\"Is this good enough?\\" The 'Joker' was speaking. < Appearance (5) > End"},{"prompt":"translate to English, don't change symbol and line break.

'뭐 생각보다 한국이랑 크게 다를 게 없는디?' 낯설지 않다는 것이었다. 세계 영화판을 호령하는 헐리웃이라고 해서 대본리딩이 특별한 건 없었다. 분위 기 자체는 한국과 거의 비슷했다. 다른 점은 단 하나였다. 싹- 다 외국인이라는 것. 역시나 강우진의 생각대로였다. 이름값이 어마어마한 헐리웃이라고 할지라도 크게 특별한 점은 없었다. 직전까진 첫 경험인 헐리웃 대본리딩 덕에 약간 긴장된 건 있었다만, 비슷한 분위기에 그마저도 누그러지는 우진이었다. 반면, 그의 마음가짐은 평소완 조금 달랐다. 전투력이 상승했다. 이 대본리딩장에서 유일한 한국배우인 강우진. 심지어 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생'의 남주. 거의 똑같은 환경의 리딩이라고 하지만, 분명히 배경과 인물들은 판이했다. 한국에서의 대본리딩이라고 한 다면 컨셉질 유지를 위한 전쟁이었다면, 이곳에서는 한국 대표로서의 자존감을 폭발해야 하는 전쟁터다. 이 복도를 지나 리딩장에 도착하면 수많은 헐리웃 배우들이 즐비할 것이며. '죄다 나를 구경하겠지?' 강우진을 판단할 것이 틀림없었다. '삐에로:빌런의 탄생'의 유일한 한국배우에 남주이며, 현재 헐리웃을 여 러 이슈들로 들썩이게 하고있는 장본인. 누가 됐든 궁금해하는 것이 자연스럽다. 국가대표의 마음이 이런 것인가? 딱히 누가 덤빈 것도 아닌데 우진의 심정에 뜨거운 것이 솟구쳐올랐다. 모두를 짓누를 생각을 한다기보다 는 확실히 알리고 싶은 것에 가깝다. ‘내가 강우진이다' 따위의 정도? 하지만 오바를 떨 필요는 없었다. ‘너무 오바떨고 쎈척하면 도리어 약해 보이는 법이지. 응, 그래. 적당히- 쿨함을 장착하고 유연하고 의연하 게. 그런데 이제 실력을 보일 땐 확실하게.' 그런 강우진이 리딩장에 도달했을 무렵, 나름 익숙한 헐리웃 탑배우의 뒷모습이 가장 먼저 보였다. 크리스 하트넷이었다. 그는 리딩장 안 사람들에게 말하고 있었다. “그리고 나는 오디션에 시도조차 안 했어. 포기했거든 강우진의 연기를 보고. 전의를 상실했다고 말해야 하나?\\" 아니 이 양반, 여기서 뭔 쌉소리를 하고있는 거냐? 무심한 얼굴인 우진이었지만 내면으로는 꽤 놀랐다. ‘뭐여? 뭔데??!' 자신의 얘기를 하는 것도 이상했지만, 퍽 예민한 얘기를 대수롭지 않게 줄줄 뱉는 크리스가 영 요상했으니 까. ‘역시 헐리웃이라 이거냐? 졸라 개방적이네. 아니 걍 저 남자가 특이한 건가?' 더 구경할 마음이 있긴 했으나 우진은 일단 크리스에게 낮은 톤의 영어로 인기척을 냈다. \\"안녕하세요, 크리스.\\" 크리스 하트넷이 약간 움찔하며 몸을 뒤쪽으로 돌렸고, 어느새 짙은 컨셉질을 장착한 우진이 차분하고 묵 직하게 리딩장으로 들어섰다. 넓은 공간 중앙에 배치된 ᄆ자형 책상, 그 위에 즐비한 외국인 배우들, 바로 왼 쪽에 놓인 수십 의자들에도 마찬가지. \\"......\\" 수많은 외국인들을 가만히 훑는 강우진. 표정에 큰 변화는 없다. 특이한 것은 외국인들이 득실득실한 리딩 장이 심히 고요하다는 것. 그리고 헐리웃 배우들 포함 전부가 우진을 응시하는 중이었다. 다분히 부담될 상 황이었지만 강우진은 별 반응이 없었다. 이때. -스윽. 매력적인 짙은 갈색 눈동자의 크리스 하트넷이 강우진에게 붙었다. 옅게 미소짓는 그. \\"오랜만이네요, 마지막으로 봤을 때와는 당신의 기세 차이는 크네요.\\" '에미상' 남우주연상을 포함해, 헐리웃 관련 여러 건을 언급하는 것이었다. 크리스와 간단히 악수를 나눈 강우진의 대답은 짧았다. “DM으로 보낸 준 응원은 감사했습니다.” \\"뭘요, 우린 친구잖아요.\\" 친구? 누구랑? 나랑? 속으로 고개를 갸웃했지만 겉으론 별수롭지 않게 강우진이 끄덕였다. \\"그렇죠.\\" 우진이 크리스와 적당한 대화 중일 때도 이 둘을 빼면 리딩장은 조용했다. 허나 모두는 등장한 강우진을 가늠하고 있었다. 초대된 외국인 기자들도. '과연 저 여유 하며, 분위기 자체는 뭔가 남다르긴 하군.' '헐리웃에서의 대본리딩은 처음일 텐데도......전혀 흔들림 없이 꼿꼿하다고 해야 할까? 오만함? 아니 그저 강인할 뿐인가.' 배우들의 팀원, 관계자, 제작진 등등. 특히, ᄆ자형 테이블에 자리한 헐리웃 배우들이 속내들이 시끄러웠다. '남주로서 당연한 거긴 하지만 전혀 주눅 들지 않아, 거기다 아우라가 무거워.' ‘크리스랑 친한가? 것보다 일들이 많이 터지는 중이라도 헐리웃 진출은 얼마 안 됐을 텐데- 왜 저리 여유 롭지?' '어색한 모습도 없고......근데 생각보다 많이 시니컬 한걸? 저게 원래 캐릭턴가?' '확실히 일반적인 아우라는 아니야.' 무음이지만 강우진을 향한 내면의 평가들이 즐펀하게 뿌려졌다. 대체로 우진의 평가는 ‘역시 심상치 않군' 정도였다. 그 심상치 않은 강우진의 알맹이는 약간 호들갑 떨며 신기해하는 중이었다. ‘오오- 배우들 개많네. 저 배우랑 저 배우는 많이 봤다, 저 배우도!' 눈에 익은 헐리웃 배우들이 많았으니까. 새삼 출세했네 싶은 그였다. ‘사람 일 모른다 몰라, 쟤네들이랑 같이 대본리딩을 할 줄 알았겠냐고.' 이어 크리스 포함, 주변 외국인들에게 적당히 인사를 한 강우진이 움직였다. 너무 시선을 집중 받는 것이 조금은 귀찮기도 했으니까. 눈알을 굴려 자신의 자리를 확인한 강우진. -[헨리 고든 역/ 강우진] ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생'의 남주의 자리 겸, ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오’가 목숨을 건 '시네마틱 유니버스'의 첫 캐릭터 의 좌석이기도 했다. -슥. 우진이 자리에 앉자 리딩장 전체론 묘한 긴장감이 퍼졌고, 뒤쪽 의자에 포진된 '컬럼비아 스튜디오' 간부 들은 천천히 고개를 끄덕였다. '첫 빌런의 포스가 저 정도는 돼야지. 이미 그들은 강우진의 컨셉질에 전염 당했다. 곧, 자리에 앉은 강우진의 오른쪽에 크리스가 앉았다. 그의 착석으로 ᄆ자형 테이블의 배우들 자리엔 빈자리는 없었다. 배우들이 모두 도착한 것. 그러자. -파바바바박! 무수한 셔터음이 들렸다. 기자들이 완성된 '삐에로:빌런의 탄생' 구도를 찍기 시작했기 때문. 물론. '강우진을 중심으로. ‘메인은 저 강우진이지.' 모든 사진엔 우진이 무조건 찍혔다. 오른쪽의 크리스도. 그때였다. -스으. 과열된 리딩장으로 인물 몇몇이 추가도 등장했다. 주름진 얼굴의 또 한 명의 한국인. 안가복 감독과 인상 이 세다 싶은 여자. 즉, '삐에로: 빌런의 탄생'의 총괄 프로듀서였다. 안가복 감독은 리딩장에 들어서자마자 영 화사 간부들부터 여럿에게 인사하면서도. \\".....\\" 남주 자리에 앉은 강우진과 시선을 나눴다. ‘잘 어울리는구만, '거머리' 이후로 두 번짼가?' 상황과 배우들 그리고 헐리웃이라는 배경은 과거완 달랐지만, ‘거머리' 때와 지금의 모습에 유일한 공통점 이 존재했다. 총괄 감독이 안가복이라는 것, 강우진이 남주라는 것. 그렇게 안가복 감독과 프로듀서가 자리로 움직였다. 우진의 바로 왼쪽, ᄆ자형 책상에서 상석의 의자를 빼낸 안가복 감독이 강우진을 보며 나지막이 말했다. 한국어였다. “즐겨봅시다, 그리고 살살해요 살살.” 잠시 뒤. 안가복 감독의 입장으로 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생' 대본리딩이 본격적으로 시작됐다. 넓은 리딩장엔 수십 헐리 웃 배우 포함, 최소 백여 명의 외국인들이 응집됐다. 분위기를 호령하는 건 안가복 감독이었다. “반갑습니다, ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생'의 연출은 맡은 안가복 감독입니다.” 그가 인사하자 박수가 울렸다. 다음 인사는 총괄 프로듀서였고 안가복 감독이 말을 이었다. “일단 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생'에 합류해주신 것에 감사드립니다. 많은 이들의 관심이 높고, 원대한 기획인 '시 네마틱 유니버스'의 서막인 만큼 최선을 다해 임할 것입니다. 전부 나와 비슷한 마음일 거라 생각합니다. 잘 부탁합니다. 일단 시나리오는 모두 준비했으나 각자의 것으로 해도 됩니다.\\" 어느새 진중한 분위기가 팽배해졌다. 강우진의 표정도 심히 딱딱했다. 허나 우진은 내면으로 딴생각이 진 했다. '워- 씨, 영물 할아버지. 아니 안 감독님 영어 실력 개많이 늘었네??' 곧, 안가복 감독이 배우들 소개를 진행했다. \\"헨리 고든 역의 강우진.\\" 딴생각하다 흠칫한 우진이 컨셉질을 바로 잡았다. 스르륵 일어난 그가 세상 묵직한 영어를 뱉었다. \\"강우진입니다. 재밌게 촬영하겠습니다.\\" 무척이나 간단한 인사말. 이에 헐리웃 배우들이 약간 놀랐다. 미간을 좁히는 이도 있었다. '긴장했나? 그렇게는 안 보이는데.' 그러거나 말거나 안가복 감독은 배우 소개를 이었다. 다음은 크리스 하트넷이었다. 그는 우진과 달리 인사 에 농담을 섞었다. 후로 전체 배우들 소개는 약 30분 이상 소요됐다. 총괄 프로듀서와 키스탭, '컬럼비아 스 튜디오' 간부들 등까지 소개하니 1시간이 지났다. 이윽고. -팔락. 주름진 얼굴의 안가복 감독이 시나리오를 펼쳤다. 그를 따라 강우진, 크리스 외의 전체 헐리웃 배우들도 같은 액션을 취했다. 촬영팀은 사방에 설치된 카메라를 점검했고, 기자 등 나머지 인물들은 배우들에 시선을 집중했다. 정확히는 대부분이 강우진을 본다. 본격적으로 '삐에로: 빌런의 탄생'의 대본리딩의 스타트는 안가복 감독의 입에서부터였다. “밤의 도로, 버스 한 대가 달리고 있다.\\" 당연하겠지만 지문과 기타 부수적인 건 안가복 감독이 맡았다. '삐에로:빌런의 탄생'의 시작점은 ‘헨리 고 든’보단, 각성한 ‘조커(Joker)'의 형태가 잠시 보이는 것부터였다. 지문을 읽던 안가복 감독이 바통을 강우진 에게 넘겼다. \\".....\\" 지금의 우진은 이미 ‘헨리 고든’. 아니, '조커(Joker)'를 진작에 끌어 올렸다. 크리스와 주변 헐리웃 배우들이 연기처럼 사라졌다. 그저 낙서 가득한 버스가 그의 시야에 보였다. 버스의 배기음이 귓가에 울렸다. 조금은 젖은 붉은 머리가 눈을 찔렀다. \\"후-\\" 대강 머리를 쓸어 넘겼다. 광기, 광기가 온몸 혈관을 탄다. 내장들과 뇌에 스며든다. 비극과 희극이 공존했다. 감정이 치솟았다. 나열 할 필요는 없다. 어차피 너희들은 나를 이해하지 못한다. 강우진의 입가가 찢어졌다. 웃었다. 저걸 '웃었다' 표현하는 게 맞나 싶지만 딱히 다른 방도가 없다. 다분히 소름 돋는 표정과 눈빛이었다. 그 야말로 비극과 희극이 얼굴에 공존했다. 얼핏 무서워 도망쳐야 될 것 같지만 묘하게 든든하기도 했다. 처음으로 강우진의 ‘헨리 고든'을 맛본 수십 헐리웃 배우들의 두 눈이 커졌다. \\".....\\" \\".....\\" 작게 입을 벌리거나 ‘저게 뭐지?' 따위의 얼굴로 미간을 좁히기도 했다. 이어 시나리오상 건들대는 양아치 남자들이 등장할 차례였다. 그들은 단역이라 대사는 안가복 감독과 프로듀서가 맡았다. 폭력이 오갔다. 강우진의 입가는 더 찢어졌다. \\"-흐으-\\" 실제 밟히는 건 아니었으나 우진의 웃음은 더욱 격렬해졌고 광기가 진해졌다. “크크크! 하하하! 하하하하하!\\" 그의 괴기한 웃음이 리딩장 전체를 감쌌다. 여기서부터는 배우들의 수십 스탭들과 기자들 전부의 팔뚝에 닭살이 돋았다. ‘대본리딩에 돌입하자마자 저만한 농도의 연기가 바로 튀어나온다고?' 그러나 진행은 멈추지 않았다. 이번엔 안가복 감독이 버스 기사가 되어 대사쳤고. \\"다, 당신! 미쳤구만!\\" 고개를 약간 삐딱하게 꺾은 강우진이 받아쳤다. \\"미쳤다니, 극찬인걸?\\" 10분도 안 되는 이 씬에서 강우진을 보는 모든 배우들 시야가 변했다. '.....'조커(Joker)'' '세상에, 마치 시나리오를 찢고 현실로 나온 것 같잖아?' '망할 연기를 봤는데 왜 헛것이 보이는 거야.' 앉아 있던 우진은 온데간데없었다. 하얗고 벌겋게 칠해진 ‘삐에로'로 교체됐으니까. 하지만 그것은 오래가지 않았다. \\"헤진 집업 후드를 입은 남자가 거리를 걷고 있다.\\" 안가복 감독이 읊은 지문이 씬 변경을 알렸으니까. 그러자 광기 가득했던 우진의 웃음이 싹 사라졌다. 찰 나였다. 그리고 현재의 강우진은. \\"뭐야?\\" “아, 아니. 저는.\\" 굽은 어깨의 유약한 '헨리 고든'이었다. 딴사람이라 봐도 무방했다. 그러나 마냥 멍청이 같진 않았다. 약해 빠진 표정과 몸짓이었지만, 우진의 눈빛엔 미약한 분노가 숨겨져 있다. 그것은 호흡과 잠시잠깐 표출되는 그 의 대사 강세에서 느낄 수 있었다. 광기는 사라진 게 아니다. 심연에 감췄다. 우진의 터무니없는 연기법을 감상하던 헐리웃 배우들은. '.....그가 왜 ‘헨리 고든’에 낙점됐는지 알겠군.' 점차 인정했다. '보고도 믿기지가 않아, 어떻게 저런 수준 높은 연기를 아무렇지 않게 할 수 있지?' ‘메소드? 아니야- 저건 그보다 좀 더 상위의 뭔가다. 대단해, 크리스를 밀어낼만했어' ‘망할. 돋은 소름이 풀리지 않네, 솔직히 이질감이 들 줄 알았는데......전혀. 저건 연기라기보다는- 그냥 ‘조 커(Joker)' 그 자체잖아??' 왜 강우진이라는 한국배우가 이 거대한 작품의 남주에, 크리스보다 앞의 자리에 앉아 있는지를 이해했다. ‘분석할 필요가 없어. 빠져들어서 봤다, 연기가 저 정도나 되면 '헨리 고든' 역을 안 줄 수가 있나.' 포진된 헐리웃 배우들은 심히 충격을 받았다. 더불어 초반에 가졌던 호기심부터 의심을 깔끔하게 지워냈 다. '미쳤군, 마치 '조커(Joker)'와 같은 공간에 있는 느낌이야. 크리스가 오디션을 포기할 만해.' 여기서 저 강우진을 인정하지 않는 건 그저 객기일 뿐이었으니까. 이쯤, '헨리 고든'의 씬이 끝났다. 안가복 감독은 다음 씬을 넘기기 전에 작게 '컷'을 뱉었다. 배우들이 처음 모인 자리니만큼 틈새마다 호흡을 정렬할 시간을 준 것. 곧, 리딩장에 웅성거림이 울렸다. 기자들, 관계자들 할 것 없이 서로 대화하기 바빴다. 이 순간. \\"강우진씨.\\" 무심한 얼굴로 시나리오 보는 우진에게 작게 고개 갸웃한 크리스가 물었다. \\"오디션 때와는 느낌이 좀 다른데요, 힘이 좀 빠진 듯한.” 그를 잠시간 바라보던 우진이 간단히 답했다. \\"대본리딩이니 적당히 했을 뿐입니다.” 사실이었다. 순간 몰린 수십 헐리웃 배우들의 얼굴이 티 나게 구겨졌다. '뭐? 저, 적당히?' < 등장 (2) > 끝","completion":"< Appearance (2) > When Kang Woojin first arrived at the reading site for 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain,' he had one thought in mind. \\"What, it's not much different from Korea, is it?\\" It was the familiarity that struck him. Even in Hollywood, which commands the world's film industry, there was nothing special about script readings. The atmosphere itself was almost identical to that of Korea. There was only one difference. Everyone was a foreigner. As Kang Woojin had expected, even the illustrious Hollywood was not much different. He had been a bit nervous due to the Hollywood script reading being a first-time experience, but the similar atmosphere quickly eased his tension. On the other hand, his mindset was slightly different than usual. His fighting spirit had risen. Kang Woojin, the only Korean actor in this script reading room and even the male lead of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain.' Although the reading environment was almost the same, the background and the people were definitely different. If a script reading in Korea was a battle to maintain one's concept, here it was a battlefield where he had to explode with the pride of representing Korea. Once he passed through this corridor and arrived at the reading room, numerous Hollywood actors would be present. 'They'll all be looking at me, won't they?' It was certain that Kang Woojin would be judged. The only Korean actor in 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain,' the male lead, and the person currently stirring up various issues in Hollywood. It was natural for anyone to be curious. Is this what it feels like to be a national representative? Even though no one had provoked him, a fiery feeling surged within Woojin. It was closer to wanting to make something clear rather than wanting to overpower everyone. Something like 'I am Kang Woojin'? But there was no need to overdo it. 'If you act too tough and overdo it, you'll look weaker. Yes, that's right. Just enough—equip coolness, be flexible and composed. But when it's time to show your skills, make it clear.' As Kang Woojin reached the reading room, the first thing he saw was the back of a familiar Hollywood top actor. It was Chris Hartnett. He was speaking to the people inside the reading room. \\"And I didn't even try to audition. I gave up after seeing Kang Woojin's acting. Should I say I lost my will?\\" What is this guy talking about here? Woojin kept a nonchalant face, but inside he was quite surprised. 'What? What's going on??!' It was strange enough to hear his own story, but Chris was oddly spouting sensitive topics nonchalantly. 'Is this Hollywood style? So damn open. Or is that guy just unique?' Although Woojin was curious to see more, he first greeted Chris in English with a low tone. \\"Hello, Chris.\\" Chris Hartnett flinched slightly and turned around, and Woojin, now equipped with a deep concept, entered the reading room calmly and heavily. The U-shaped table placed in the center of the spacious space, the foreign actors crowded on top of it, and the dozens of chairs on the immediate left were the same. \\"......\\" Kang Woojin quietly scanned the numerous foreigners. There was no significant change in his expression. What was peculiar was that the reading room, swarming with foreigners, was eerily quiet. And all the Hollywood actors, including everyone else, were staring at Woojin. It was a situation that could be quite burdensome, but Kang Woojin showed no reaction. At that moment. -Swish. Chris Hartnett, with his attractive deep brown eyes, approached Kang Woojin. He was smiling faintly. \\"It's been a while, you seem much more imposing than the last time I saw you.\\" He was referring to the 'Emmy' Lead Actor Award, among other Hollywood-related mentions. Kang Woojin's response to Chris, with whom he had just exchanged a simple handshake, was brief. \\"I appreciated the support you sent via DM.\\" \\"Don't mention it, we're friends, aren't we?\\" Friends? With whom? Me? Woojin inwardly tilted his head but outwardly nodded nonchalantly. \\"That's right.\\" Even as Woojin was having a proper conversation with Chris, the reading room remained quiet without them. However, everyone was still sizing up the newly arrived Kang Woojin. Even the foreign reporters who were invited. 'Indeed, he seems relaxed, and the atmosphere itself is somewhat different.' 'It's his first script reading in Hollywood, but... there's no sign of being shaken at all. Arrogance? No, just strength.' Actors' teammates, associates, production staff, etc. Especially the Hollywood actors seated at the U-shaped table were noisy inside. 'As the male lead, it's natural, but he's not intimidated at all, and his aura is heavy.' 'Is he friends with Chris? More than that, even though he hasn't been in Hollywood for long, considering the issues he's facing—why is he so relaxed?' 'No awkwardness... But isn't he more cynical than I thought? Is that his real character?' 'Definitely not the usual aura.' Though silent, the inner evaluations of Kang Woojin were cheerfully scattered. Generally, the assessment of Woojin was 'indeed, he's extraordinary.' The core of that extraordinary Kang Woojin was somewhat excited and amazed. 'Wow—there are so many actors. I've seen that actor and that actor a lot, and that one too!' There were many familiar Hollywood actors. He felt anew that he had made it big. 'You never know with people, who would have thought I'd be doing a script reading with them.' Then, after greeting the surrounding foreigners, including Chris, Kang Woojin moved. Being the focus of too much attention was a bit bothersome. Woojin rolled his eyes to check his seat. -[Role of Henry Gordon / Kang Woojin] It was the seat of the male lead of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain,' and also the seat of the first character of 'Columbia Studio's' life-or-death 'Cinematic Universe.' -Swoosh. As Woojin sat down, a strange tension spread throughout the reading room, and the executives of 'Columbia Studio' seated in the back slowly nodded their heads. 'The first villain should have that kind of presence.' They had already been infected by Kang Woojin's concept. Soon, Chris sat down to Woojin's right. With his seating, there were no empty seats left at the U-shaped table of actors. All the actors had arrived. Then. -Papapapapak! A multitude of shutter sounds were heard. The reporters began to photograph the completed 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' formation. Of course. 'Centered around Kang Woojin. 'The main focus is Kang Woojin.' All the photos inevitably included Woojin. Chris on the right as well. It was then. -Sss. Due to the overheated reading room, a few more characters appeared. A wrinkled-faced Korean, Director An Gabok, and a woman with a stern look. In other words, the executive producer of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain.' As soon as Director An Gabok entered the reading room, he greeted several people, including the movie company executives, and also. \\".....\\" Exchanged glances with Kang Woojin, who was seated in the male lead's spot. 'It suits you well, isn't this the second time since 'Leech'?' The situation, actors, and the backdrop of Hollywood were different from the past, but there was one commonality between the time of 'Leech' and now. The fact that the overall director was An Gabok and Kang Woojin was the male lead. Thus, Director An Gabok and the producer moved to their seats. To the left of Woojin, Director An Gabok, who had removed a chair from the U-shaped table for the head seat, spoke to Kang Woojin in a low voice. It was in Korean. \\"Let's enjoy this, and go easy, okay?\\" Shortly after. With the entrance of Director An Gabok, the script reading for 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' officially began. The spacious reading room was filled with at least a hundred foreigners, including dozens of Hollywood actors. Director An Gabok commanded the atmosphere. \\"Nice to meet you, I'm Director An Gabok, in charge of directing 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain.'\\" As he greeted, applause rang out. The next greeting was from the executive producer, and Director An Gabok continued. \\"First of all, I would like to thank you for joining 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain.' There is high interest from many, and as it is the prelude to the grand plan of the 'Cinematic Universe,' we will do our best. I believe everyone feels similar to me. Thank you in advance. The script is ready for everyone, but you can use your own if you prefer.\\" A serious atmosphere quickly filled the room. Kang Woojin's expression also became very stiff. However, Woojin was deeply distracted inside. 'Wow, old man of the spirits. No, Director An, your English skills have improved a lot, haven't they??' Soon, Director An Gabok introduced the actors. \\"Kang Woojin in the role of Henry Gordon.\\" Caught off guard by his thoughts, Woojin quickly adjusted his concept. Rising smoothly, he uttered his words in heavy English. \\"I'm Kang Woojin. I'll make it a fun shoot.\\" A very simple greeting. To this, the Hollywood actors were slightly surprised. Some furrowed their brows. 'Is he nervous? It doesn't seem like it.' Regardless, Director An Gabok continued with the actor introductions. Next was Chris Hartnett. Unlike Woojin, he mixed jokes into his greeting. Afterward, the entire actor introductions took over 30 minutes. Including the executive producer, key staff, and 'Columbia Studio' executives, it took an hour. Eventually. -Flap. Director An Gabok with the wrinkled face opened the script. Following him, Kang Woojin, Chris, and all the other Hollywood actors did the same. The filming team checked the cameras set up around, and the rest of the people, including reporters, focused their attention on the actors. Specifically, most were looking at Kang Woojin. The official start of the script reading for 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' began with Director An Gabok's words. \\"A bus is driving down the night road.\\" Naturally, Director An Gabok took care of the directions and other ancillary matters. The starting point of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' was not 'Henry Gordon,' but a brief glimpse of the awakened 'Joker.' As Director An Gabok read the directions, he passed the baton to Kang Woojin. \\".....\\" Now, Woojin was already 'Henry Gordon.' No, he had already brought up the 'Joker.' Chris and the surrounding Hollywood actors disappeared like an act. He only saw a bus full of graffiti in his view. The sound of the bus's exhaust echoed in his ears. The slightly wet red hair stung his eyes. \\"Huh-\\" He roughly swept his hair back. Madness, madness coursed through his veins. It seeped into his organs and brain. Tragedy and comedy coexisted. Emotions surged. There was no need to list them. After all, you people can't understand me. Kang Woojin's mouth split into a smile. It's questionable whether calling it a 'smile' is correct, but there's no other way to describe it. It was a distinctly chilling expression and gaze. It was as if tragedy and comedy coexisted on his face. At first glance, it seemed scary enough to run away, but strangely, it also felt reassuring. For the first time, dozens of Hollywood actors who tasted Kang Woojin's 'Henry Gordon' widened their eyes. \\".....\\" \\".....\\" Some opened their mouths slightly or furrowed their brows as if to say, 'What is that?' Then it was time for the thugs in the script to appear. They were extras, so their lines were taken by Director An Gabok and the producer. Violence ensued. Kang Woojin's mouth split even wider. \\"-Hehe-\\" Although he wasn't actually being stepped on, Woojin's laughter grew more violent and his madness intensified. \\"Kekeke! Hahaha! Hahahahaha!\\" His eerie laughter enveloped the entire reading room. From this point on, the arms of all the actors, dozens of staff, and reporters were covered in goosebumps. 'To burst into such a dense performance right at the start of the script reading?' However, the progress did not stop. This time, Director An Gabok became the bus driver and spoke. \\"You, you're crazy!\\" Kang Woojin, with his head slightly tilted, retorted. \\"Crazy, you say? That's quite the compliment.\\" In less than 10 minutes of this scene, the view of all the actors watching Kang Woojin changed. '...'Joker'' 'It's like he's torn through the script and stepped into reality, isn't it?' 'I've seen some acting, but why am I seeing hallucinations?' The sitting Woojin was nowhere to be found. He had been replaced by the 'Pierrot,' painted white and red. But it didn't last long. \\"A man in a torn zip-up hoodie is walking down the street.\\" Director An Gabok's recited direction signaled a scene change. Then, the madness-filled laughter of Woojin disappeared in an instant. It was momentary. And the current Kang Woojin was. \\"What's that?\\" \\"Oh, no. I'm just.\\" He was the frail 'Henry Gordon' with slumped shoulders. It was as if he was a different person. However, he wasn't just a fool. Despite his weak expression and gestures, a faint anger was hidden in Woojin's eyes. It could be felt in his breathing and the occasional emphasis in his lines. The madness hadn't disappeared. It was hidden in the abyss. As the Hollywood actors watched Woojin's absurd acting method. '...Now I see why he was chosen for 'Henry Gordon.'' They gradually acknowledged it. 'I can't believe it even though I'm watching, how can he perform such high-level acting so nonchalantly?' 'Method? No—That's something even higher. Impressive, it was worth pushing Chris aside.' 'Damn. The goosebumps won't go away. Honestly, I thought it would feel out of place... Not at all. That's not acting—it's just 'Joker' himself, isn't it?' They understood why the Korean actor Kang Woojin was sitting in the lead role of this massive project, ahead of Chris. 'There's no need to analyze. I was immersed and watched. If the acting is that good, how could they not give him the role of 'Henry Gordon'?' The Hollywood actors present were deeply shocked. They also cleanly erased the curiosity and doubt they had at the beginning. 'He's insane, it feels like I'm in the same space as 'Joker.' It's understandable why Chris gave up on the audition.' Not acknowledging Kang Woojin here would be nothing but bravado. By now, the 'Henry Gordon' scene had ended. Director An Gabok, before moving on to the next scene, quietly uttered 'cut.' Since it was the first gathering of actors, he gave them time to align their breaths in between. Soon, murmurs filled the reading room. Reporters and associates alike were busy talking to each other. At this moment. \\"Mr. Kang Woojin.\\" Chris, who was casually looking at the script with an indifferent face, asked Woojin, who had slightly tilted his head in curiosity. \\"The feeling is a bit different from the audition, isn't it? It seems a bit less intense.\\" Woojin, after looking at him for a moment, simply replied. \\"It's just a script reading, so I did it moderately.\\" It was the truth. In an instant, the faces of dozens of Hollywood actors visibly crumpled. 'What? That was, moderate?' < Appearance (2) > End"},{"prompt":"< 등장 (4) > 짙은 미소를 짓는 최성건을 보던 강우진은 덤덤했다. 딱히 시니컬한 표정에 변화가 없다. 이마를 타고 땀 이 주르륵 흘렀다. \\".....\\" 어느새 5월 말. 6월이 코앞이기에 날씨가 많이 더워진 탓이었다. 천천히 고개를 끄덕이며 최성건에게 답하 는 우진. 역시나 목소리는 착 깔았다. “첫 촬영이 확정됐습니까?\\" “그래.” 미소를 머금은 최성건이 강우진의 어깨에 손을 올리며 엄지를 펼쳤다. \\"6월 둘째 주, 정확하게는 6월 11일. 뭐 사정상 앞으로나 뒤로나 하루 이틀 차이 날 가능성은 있다고 하는 데, 별문제 없으면 11일에 크랭크인일 거다.” 11일이라- 진짜 며칠 안 남았네? 겉으로야 딱딱한 우진이었지만, 내면으로는 약간 긴장감이 올랐다. 언제나, 작품마다 느끼기에 대본리딩을 포함한 준비과정과 본 촬영의 무게는 천지 차이였으니까. 지금까 지 촬영한 모든 작품이 그랬다. 약간 뭐랄까, 준비과정은 전부 총의 장전에 속했고 첫 촬영은 이윽고 세상을 향해 격발하는 느낌. ‘더군다나 이번엔 헐리웃이잖아?' 그게 끝이 아니다. 수많은 최초와 기록을 세우며 강우진은 아시아 최초로 헐리웃 주연 배우를 먹었다. 그 것의 시발탄. 오늘은 5월 27일이었다. 6월 11일이면 남은 기간은 대략 2주. 길다면 길고 짧다면 짧다. 아니지, 지금 강우진의 지옥 같은 스케줄을 본다면 상당히 촉박했다. 적당한 긴장감이 서린 강우진이 입고 있던 정장 재킷을 벗었다. 열기가 후끈해서였다. -스윽. 그리곤 웃고 있는 최성건을 시작으로 팀원들의 얼굴을 훑었다. 모두 기대가 가득한 표정이었다. 이어 우진이 몸을 돌렸다. ‘이로운 악' 파트2 촬영터가 보인다. 어둑한 밤, 하지만 설치된 조명은 눈이 부시 게 밝다. 그 주변으로 점차 몰려드는 벌래, 뒷정리가 한창인 백여 명에 가까운 스탭들, 내일의 촬영 관련 조 연출 등과 얘기 중인 턱수염 송만우 PD. 더워진 날씨에 모두는 반팔 차림이었다. 잠시간 현장을 바라보던 강우진은 약간의 아쉬움이 느껴졌다. ·한국에서의 촬영은 여기가 끝이겠네. 뭐여 이 기분? 괜히 촉촉해지네. 컨셉질 짙은 얼굴이야 변함없이 굳건하지만 그의 마음은 살짝 여려졌다. 그도 그럴 게 이번에 LA로 넘어 가면 정말 한동안은 한국에 돌아오지 않게 될 테니까. 어쩌다 여기까지 왔나? 별의별 생각이 스치는 우진의 옆으로 최성건이 붙었다. 강우진과 같이 정면을 바로 보던 그가 입을 열었다. \\"왜? 뭔가 기분이 촉촉해지냐? 이제 진짜 헐리웃에서만 지낼 생각하니까?\\" 뭐지? 돗자리 깔아도 되겠네. 속으로 움찔한 우진이 애써 아무렇지 않게 답했다. “아니요. 그냥 시간이 빠르다 싶어서요.” “하하, 그건 그래. 벌써 너 처음 보고 3년째잖냐? '프로파일러 한량'이 어제 같은데 말이지. 저- 기 송 PD님 이 계셔서 더 그래.” 이쯤, 시선을 눈치챘는지 어쨌는지 스탭들과 대화하던 송만우 PD가 뛰어왔다. 검은 반팔에 모자를 푹 눌 러쓴 그는 도착과 동시에 내일 촬영 얘기부터 꺼냈다. “내일은 정오부터 스탠바이하죠,” \\"알겠습니다.” 우진의 건조한 대답 뒤 최성건이 고개를 갸웃했다. \\"음? 근데 좀 늦게 시작하네요?\\" “아- 아침에 넷플렉스 들어가서 인터뷰 촬영이 있어요. '에미상' 관련해서 넷플 본사가 요청했다나 뭐라나. 근데 무슨 일 터졌습니까? 어째 두 분이 좀 심각해 보이는데?\\" 대답은 강우진이 간결하게 뱉었다. “'삐에로:빌런의 탄생' 첫 촬영날이 잡혔습니다.\\" 잠시 멈칫한 송만우 PD가 두 눈을 키우며 흥분을 키웠다. \\"오! 오오!! 그래요?? 언제?\\" \\"6월 11일이요.\\" “11일? 가만있어봐 11일이면- 2주 남았네? 어이구 좀 빡빡하네. 우진씨 너무 갈리는 거 아닌가? 괜찮아 요?\\" \\"문제없습니다.\\" \\"뭐 문제없는 거야 잘 알지. 그래도 건강은 잘 챙겨야죠, 그러다 우진씨 한 번 픽 쓰러지면.....어후 몇 작품 이 올스톱 되는 거야?\\" 상상만 해도 오금이 저리다는 표현을 보인 송만우 PD가 대뜸. -즉. 손가락들을 접으며 뭔가를 계산했다. 돌연 진중한 얼굴로 변하는 그. “우리가 얼추 6월 7일쯤 크랭크업 예정했었는데- 그거 조금 당겨보죠, 며칠이라도. 무리 좀 하면 시간 단 축시키는 거야 일도 아니지.\\" “굳이 그러실 필요는.” \\"아니지, 아니야.\\" 점차 웃음이 번지던 송만우 PD가 조연출을 호출한 뒤 말했다. “우리 ‘월드스타'님의 첫 출진 날이 당도했는데 컨디션이 좋아야지, 안 그래요 최대표님?” “하하하, 그래 주시면 감사하죠.\\" “4일이나 5일 마무리로 최대한 당겨봅시다.” 결론을 지은 송만우 PD가 무던한 강우진을 보다가 입꼬리를 주욱 찢었다. \\"헐리웃 것들 놀라서 오바이트 쏠리게 해버려요.\\" 한편, LA. 자정을 넘긴 한국과는 달리 LA는 이른 아침이었다. 도로에 차들이 빼곡하고 여기저기서 빵빵 경적이 귀가 찢기듯 울리는 중. 카페부터 베이글 가게는 물론, 인도에도 외국인들이 가득했다. 지하철 역시 마찬가지. 언뜻 갱단의 소굴처럼 보이기도 하는 LA의 한 지하철 내부에. \\"....음.\\" 익숙한 얼굴의 늙은 남자가 들어섰다. 적당한 반팔에 편한 청바지 차림의 안가복 감독이었다. 물론, 그 혼 자만 있는 건 아니었다. 주변으로 최소 열댓명 되는 외국인이 붙어 있는 상태. '삐에로:빌런의 탄생'의 키스탭 들이었다. 안가복 감독 포함 이들이 지하철에 등장한 이유는 간단했다. '역시 지하철 씬은 세트가 아니라 로케가 낫겠어.' 지금 안가복 감독이 읊조린 것처럼 '삐에로:빌런의 탄생'의 장소헌팅을 나온 것. 촬영 일정상 이번이 마지 막이었다. 사실, 장소헌팅이야 진작에 마무리됐지만, 안가복 감독의 요청으로 일정을 추가한 것이었다. -끼이이익! 때마침 지하철이 도착했다. 그러나 안가복 감독과 외국인 키스탭들은 타지 않았다. 안가복은 턱을 쓸며 승강장 전체를 눈에 담았고, 몇몇 키스탭들은 곳곳을 돌며 사진을 찍기 바빴다. 이쯤 안가복 감독에겐 여러 가지가 눈에 띄었다. 벽면에 갈겨진 낙서들, 구석이나 의자에 자리를 잡은 노숙자들, 특이한 행색의 사람들, 연습생인지 뭔지 모르지만 기타 치는 남자도 있었다. -♫♪ 하지만 기타 소리는 안가복 감독에게 다르게 들렸다. '음악이 깔리고.' ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생'의 많은 OST 중 하나가 귓가에 맴돈다. 그때 노숙자들을 단속하려는 경찰들이 승강장 에 나타났고, 안가복의 눈은 어느새 카메라 앵글과 같아졌다. 강우진이 나타났다. 아니, 정확하게는. ‘춤을 추는 ‘조커(Joker)', 그를 쫓는 경찰.' '조커(Joker)'였다. 눈앞 경찰 두 명이 노숙자들을 단속하는 장면은 안가복 감독에겐, '조커(Joker)'가 탭댄스를 추며 경찰을 조롱하는 씬처럼 비춰졌다. 화가 난 경찰들은 육중한 몸으로 뒤뚱대며 강우진 또는 '조커(Joker)'를 쫓지만 역부족이다. 이죽대며 담배까지 치는 여유를 보이는 '조커(Joker)'. '조커(Joker)'는 계단 손잡이에 엉덩이를 붙여 마치 미끄럼틀 타듯 주르륵 내려간다. 긴 담배 연기를 뿜던 그가 계단 위쪽을 올려본다. 뚱뚱한 경찰들이 죽을 듯 쫓지만, 붉은 긴 머리를 쓸어 넘긴 '조커(Joker)'는 비죽 웃으며 탭댄스를 가미한 발걸음을 옮겼다. 그다음 대사는 어느새 계단 쪽으로 이동한 안가복 감독이 나지막하게 뱉었다. \\"기분 죽여주네.\\" 순간, 안가복 감독은 상상한 장면을 빨리 모니터로 보고 싶다는 욕구가 치솟았다. '후- 2주가 200년 같겠군.' 그런 그가 다가온 외국인 키스탭들에게 영어로 말했고. \\"이 씬은 여기서 촬영해야겠어요.\\" 주머니서 트럼프 카드 한 장을 꺼낸 안가복 감독이 재차 입을 열었다. 카드엔 '조커(Joker)' 그림이 그려져 있었다. “첫 촬영은 역시 '조커(Joker)'의 첫 각성 씬으로.” 약 일주일 뒤, 6월 4일. 한국. 5월이 저물었고 6월이 시작됐다. 본격적으로 열기를 내뿜는 날씨에 거리의 사람들의 복장은 죄다 가벼워 졌다. 시간은 늦은 오후쯤. 고속도로를 내달리는 승합차 안, 최근 세계로 쭉쭉 뻗고 있는 ‘이로운 악'을 집필 한 최나나 작가가 보였다. 꽤 길어진 머리를 돌돌 말아 올린 그녀는. -스윽. 핸드폰을 내려보고 있었다. '이로운 악' 관련 기사들을 확인하고 있는 것. 『'이로운 악', 세계 1위 내줬지만 세계 2위 유지하며 여전히 강세』 『에미상 10개 부문 ‘이로운 악’, 해외 유명 너튜버들이 패러디한다...괴물 드라마 증명』 『[이슈픽]세계 집어삼킨 ‘이로운 악', 시즌2 제작 소문 솔솔』 기사를 보던 최나나 작가는 동그란 안경을 추켜 올리면서도 검색 주제를 바꿨다. 그녀가 친 것은 강우진. 어마무시한 결과들이 쏟아졌다. '우와- 대박!' 강우진이 가지는 파급력이야 익히 알고 있는 최나나 작가지만, 늘 감격하는 그녀는 이렇듯 강우진을 검색 하는 게 버릇이 됐다. 참고로 최나나 작가의 몸값은 치솟은 상태. 물론, 강우진보다야 한참 못 미치지만, 첫 작품부터 안타와 세계적 홈런을 친 그녀였기에 요즘은 해외에서도 러브콜이 들어왔다. 이때. \\"작가님.\\" 최나나 작가의 옆자리에 앉은 여자가 말을 걸었다. 김소향 총괄디렉터였다. 사실 이 승합차가 출발한 것은 넷플렉스 코리아였고, 최나나 작가와 김소향 등 인원들의 목적지는 경기도 연천이었다. 즉, '이로운 악' 촬영 세트단지로 가고 있다는 뜻. 이어 작게 웃는 김소향 총괄디렉터가 최나나 작가에게 물었다. \\"'이로운 악2'의 스토리는 좀 잡히셨어요?\\" 핸드폰을 내린 최나나 작가가 머리를 긁었다. \\"아직이요......솔직히 '장연우'로 열린 이야기라서, 만약 주연이 바뀐다면 어떻게 시작해야 될지 모르겠어요.” 마찬가지로 골치가 아프다는 듯 김소향이 짧게 숨을 뱉었다. \\"후- 당연히 '장연우'가 계속 이야기를 이끌어가는 게 베스트긴 한데, 강우진씨의 수십 배로 뛴 몸값도 몸 값인데 스케줄이 문제가 돼요. 최 대표님께 물어보니까 올해는 물론이고, 내년까지도 거의 풀이라고 하셔서.” “예상은 했어요. 근데 총괄디렉터님, '이로운 악'에서 우진님이 빠지면 사람들이 볼까요?\\" \\".......시청자가 빠지겠죠, 많이. 최소 반타작은. 아니, 그 이상 날아갈지 몰라요. 그래도 넷플 본사에서 어마 어마한 자금 던지면서 추진하라는 걸 무시하는 건- 내 입장에선 어렵거든요?\\" “저도 ‘이로운 악'을 엄청엄청 애정해서 하겠다고 한 거지만 솔직히 모르겠어요, 우진님 뒤를 맡을 배우가 나타날지도 그렇고.\\" 잠시간 대화를 나누던 둘 중에 최나나 작가가 먼저 시선을 내렸다. 고민이 많은 얼굴의 그녀가 다시금 핸 드폰을 들었다. 생각이 많긴 해도 손가락은 움직인다. -스윽. 지금 최나나 작가가 접속한 건 인스타였다. 버릇적으로 강우진의 것으로 넘어갔다가, 최근 자주 접속하는 곳에 도달했다. 곧, 침울했던 그녀의 얼굴에 흥분이 번졌다. \\"어!!\\" 그러더니 옆자리 김소향에게 외쳤다. “발표했어요!!” 다급히 핸드폰 화면을 보이는 최나나 작가. 그녀가 접속한 SNS는. -[안녕하세요, 텔레비전 예술 아카데미(ATAS)입니다.] 방송계 ‘아카데미상'이라 칭하는 ‘에미상'을 주관하는 조직의 공식 채널이었다. 텔레비전 예술 아카데미(ATAS) 측은 방금 공식 발표를 게시한 상태였고, 그 내용 중 핵심을 최나나 작가가 외쳤다. \\"'에미상! 8월 1일에 열린대요!!” 두 달도 안 남았단 얘기였다. 한편, 경기도 연천. 백여 명 스탭들이 쥐죽은 듯이 촬영존을 바라보고 있었다. ‘이로운 악' 제작진이었다. 진중한 표정의 송만 우 PD는 여러 모니터 중 인물의 얼굴이 집중된 모니터를 응시했다. \\".....\\" 모니터 속 인물은 당연하겠지만 강우진이었다. 현재는 '장연우' 그 자체인 우진이 입고 있던 정장 재킷을 벗으면서도 말했다. \\"덥네\\" 촬영존 안의 그가 정면의 카메라를 향해 터벅터벅 걸었다. 얼굴에 귀찮음이 가득했다. 노곤함이 가득한 회 사원의 분위기. 그런 그가 점차 카메라와 가까워지며 다시 대사 쳤다. \\"다음은-\\" 그대로 카메라 바로 옆으로 스친다. 하지만 카메라는 요지부동. 잠시간 촬영장 전체로 고요함이 번졌다. 약 5초 정도. 어느새 강우진부터 백여 명 스탭 모두가 송만우 PD에 시선을 맞췄다. 모니터 보던 턱수염 송만 우 PD가. \\"컷!\\" 짧게 신호를 뱉으며 일어나 강우진과 시선을 교환했다. 그리곤 엄지를 추켜세웠다. “OK. 수고하셨고 최고였습니다, 우진씨.” 곧 백여 명 스탭들이 마치 짠 듯이 괴성을 질러댔고, 송만우 PD가 옷을 터는 강우진에게 붙어 악수를 청했 다. 삐에로:빌런의 탄생', 기대할게요.\\" 강우진이 무심히 답했다. “'에미상’에서 뵙겠습니다.” ‘이로운 악' 파트2 촬영이 끝났다. < 등장 (4) > 끝","completion":"< Appearance (4) > Kang Woojin looked at Choi Seonggeon, who was smiling broadly, with a nonchalant expression. There was no change in his cynical expression. Sweat trickled down his forehead. \\".....\\" It was already late May. With June just around the corner, the weather had become much hotter. Woojin slowly nodded in response to Choi Seonggeon, his voice as deep as ever. \\"Has the first shoot been confirmed?\\" \\"Yes.\\" Choi Seonggeon, still smiling, placed his hand on Kang Woojin's shoulder and gave a thumbs-up. \\"The second week of June, specifically June 11th. There's a chance it could be a day or two earlier or later due to circumstances, but if there are no issues, we'll start cranking on the 11th.\\" The 11th, huh—really not much time left? On the outside, Woojin remained stoic, but inside, a sense of tension rose. As always, with every project, the weight of the actual shooting, including script readings and other preparations, was worlds apart. It had been the case for all the projects he had shot so far. Somewhat, the preparation process was like loading a gun, and the first shoot was like finally firing it at the world. 'Especially since this time it's Hollywood, right?' And that wasn't all. Setting numerous firsts and records, Kang Woojin had become the first Asian lead actor in Hollywood. The starting shot. Today was May 27th. With June 11th approaching, there were roughly two weeks left. Long if long, short if short. But no, considering Kang Woojin's hellish schedule, it was quite tight. Woojin, feeling a suitable tension, took off the suit jacket he was wearing. It was because of the heat. -Swish. He then scanned the faces of his team members, starting with the smiling Choi Seonggeon. Everyone had expressions full of anticipation. Woojin then turned around. The set of 'Beneficial Evil Part 2' came into view. The dark night, but the installed lights were dazzlingly bright. Around them, insects were gathering, nearly a hundred staff members were busy cleaning up, and Producer Song Manwoo with a beard was discussing tomorrow's shoot with the assistant directors. Due to the hot weather, everyone was dressed in short sleeves. As Woojin watched the scene for a while, he felt a tinge of regret. 'This is the end of shooting in Korea. What's this feeling? It's getting a bit moist.' His face, heavy with concept, remained steadfast, but his heart softened slightly. After all, once he moved to LA, he really wouldn't be returning to Korea for a while. How did he get here? Beside Woojin, who was lost in various thoughts, Choi Seonggeon approached. Choi Seonggeon, looking straight ahead just like Kang Woojin, spoke up. \\"Why? Feeling a bit sentimental? Thinking about living in Hollywood for real now?\\" What's this? Could lay down a picnic mat. Woojin, startled inside, replied as if it was nothing. \\"No, just thinking how time flies.\\" \\"Haha, that's true. It's already been three years since I first saw you, right? 'Profiler Hanryang' feels like it was just yesterday. Especially with Producer Song over there, it feels even more so.\\" At this point, perhaps noticing their gaze or not, Producer Song Manwoo, who was talking with the staff, came running over. Wearing a black T-shirt and a cap pulled down low, he immediately started talking about tomorrow's shoot upon arrival. \\"Let's stand by from noon tomorrow.\\" \\"Understood.\\" After Woojin's dry response, Choi Seonggeon tilted his head. \\"Hmm? But that's a bit of a late start, isn't it?\\" \\"Ah—there's an interview shoot at Netflix in the morning. Something about the 'Emmy Awards,' Netflix headquarters requested it. But what's going on? You two seem a bit serious?\\" Woojin succinctly replied. \\"The first shooting day for 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' has been set.\\" Producer Song Manwoo paused for a moment, then his eyes widened with excitement. \\"Oh! Ohh!! Really?? When?\\" \\"June 11th.\\" \\"11th? Wait a minute, that's—2 weeks away? That's a bit tight. Aren't you stretching yourself too thin, Woojin? Are you sure you're okay?\\" \\"No problem.\\" \\"I know you're fine, but you still need to take care of your health, right? If Woojin collapses even once... phew, several projects will come to a halt, won't they?\\" Producer Song Manwoo, who seemed to feel a chill just imagining it, suddenly. -Zip. Folded his fingers as if calculating something. His face turned serious. \\"We were planning to wrap up around June 7th—let's try to move that up a bit, even if it's just a few days. It's not a big deal to shorten the time if we push a little.\\" \\"There's no need to go to that trouble.\\" \\"No, no.\\" Producer Song Manwoo, whose smile was spreading, called over the assistant director and said. \\"Our 'World Star's' first outing is approaching, and he needs to be in good condition, right, Chief Choi?\\" \\"Hahaha, I'd be grateful if you could do that.\\" \\"Let's try to wrap up by the 4th or 5th at the latest.\\" Having reached a conclusion, Producer Song Manwoo looked at the unfazed Kang Woojin and stretched his lips into a wide grin. \\"Let's shock those Hollywood folks with an overbite.\\" Meanwhile, in LA. Unlike Korea, which had passed midnight, it was early morning in LA. Cars packed the roads, and horns blared piercingly everywhere. From cafes to bagel shops, and even on the sidewalks, foreigners were everywhere. The subway was no exception. Inside an LA subway that at a glance looked like a gang's hideout. \\"....Hmm.\\" A familiar old man with a familiar face entered. It was Director An Gabok, dressed in a comfortable short-sleeved shirt and jeans. Of course, he wasn't alone. At least a dozen foreigners were attached to him. They were the key staff of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain.' The reason Director An Gabok and the others appeared in the subway was simple. 'As expected, the subway scene is better on location than on a set.' Just as Director An Gabok was murmuring, they had come out for location hunting for 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain.' This was the last schedule for shooting. In fact, location hunting had been wrapped up a while ago, but it was added to the schedule at Director An Gabok's request. -Screech! Just then, the subway arrived. However, Director An Gabok and the foreign key staff did not board. An Gabok stroked his chin and took in the entire platform, while several key staff members were busy taking photos here and there. At this point, several things caught Director An Gabok's eye. Graffiti scrawled on the walls, homeless people settled in corners and on seats, people in unusual attire, and even a man who might have been a trainee playing the guitar. -♫♪ But the sound of the guitar was heard differently by Director An Gabok. 'Music playing in the background.' One of the many OSTs of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' echoed in his ears. Then, police officers appeared on the platform to control the homeless, and An Gabok's eyes became like a camera angle. Kang Woojin appeared. No, more precisely. 'A dancing 'Joker,' chased by the police.' It was the 'Joker.' The scene of two police officers controlling the homeless in front of him was seen by Director An Gabok as a scene where the 'Joker' tap-danced and mocked the police. The angry police, with their hefty bodies, stumbled after Kang Woojin or the 'Joker,' but it was futile. The 'Joker,' who even had the leisure to smoke a cigarette while mocking them. The 'Joker' slid down the stair railing as if sliding down a slide. The 'Joker,' who had been puffing out long streams of cigarette smoke, looked up the stairs. The fat police officers chased as if they were dying, but the 'Joker,' who had swept back his long red hair, sneered and moved his feet in a tap-dance. The next line was quietly uttered by Director An Gabok, who had moved to the stairs. \\"This is killing the mood.\\" Suddenly, Director An Gabok felt an urge to see the imagined scene on the monitor as soon as possible. 'Phew—2 weeks feels like 200 years.' Saying this, he spoke to the approaching foreign key staff in English. \\"We'll have to shoot this scene here.\\" Director An Gabok took out a playing card from his pocket and spoke again. The card depicted the 'Joker.' \\"The first shoot should definitely be the 'Joker's' first awakening scene.\\" About a week later, on June 4th, in Korea. May had passed, and June had begun. The weather was heating up, and people's clothing on the streets had become lighter. It was late afternoon. Inside a van speeding down the highway, writer Choi Nana, who had penned the globally expanding 'Beneficial Evil,' was seen. With her hair grown long and rolled up, -Swish. She was looking down at her phone. She was checking articles related to 'Beneficial Evil.' \\"'Beneficial Evil' loses the world's number 1 spot but maintains strong hold as world's number 2\\" \\"'Beneficial Evil' nominated for 10 Emmy categories, parodied by famous YouTubers abroad...proves to be a monster drama\\" \\"[Issue Pick] 'Beneficial Evil' that swallowed the world, rumors of Season 2 production\\" While reading the articles, writer Choi Nana pushed up her round glasses and changed the search topic. She typed in Kang Woojin. A staggering number of results poured in. 'Wow—amazing!' Writer Choi Nana was well aware of the impact Kang Woojin had, but she always felt thrilled when searching for him, making it a habit. By the way, writer Choi Nana's value had skyrocketed. Of course, it was still far from Kang Woojin's, but since her first work was a hit both domestically and internationally, she had been receiving love calls from abroad as well. At that moment. \\"Writer.\\" The woman sitting next to writer Choi Nana spoke. It was Director Kim Sohyang. In fact, the van had departed from Netflix Korea, and the destination for writer Choi Nana, Director Kim Sohyang, and the others was Yeoncheon in Gyeonggi Province. In other words, they were heading to the 'Beneficial Evil' filming set complex. Then, Director Kim Sohyang, who was smiling softly, asked writer Choi Nana. \\"Have you got a grip on the story for 'Beneficial Evil 2'?\\" Putting down her phone, writer Choi Nana scratched her head. \\"Not yet... Honestly, since the story opened with 'Jang Yeonwoo,' if the lead changes, I'm not sure how to start it.” Director Kim Sohyang exhaled shortly, as if troubled as well. \\"Phew—Of course, it's best if 'Jang Yeonwoo' continues to lead the story, but Kang Woojin's fee has increased tenfold, and the schedule is the problem. When I asked CEO Choi, he said that not only this year but also next year is almost fully booked.\\" \\"I expected as much. But Director, if Woojin is out of 'Beneficial Evil,' will people watch it?\\" \\".......Viewership will drop, a lot. At least by half. No, maybe even more will fly away. But it's hard for me to ignore the push from Netflix headquarters throwing huge funds at us.\\" \\"I agreed to do 'Beneficial Evil' because I love it so much, but honestly, I'm not sure if an actor who can follow Woojin will appear.\\" After exchanging a few words, writer Choi Nana was the first to lower her gaze. Her face full of worries, she picked up her phone again. Though her mind was heavy with thoughts, her fingers moved. -Swish. Writer Choi Nana had logged into Instagram. Habitually moving to Kang Woojin's page, she reached a site she had been frequently visiting lately. Soon, excitement spread across her previously gloomy face. \\"Oh!!\\" Then she exclaimed to Director Kim Sohyang sitting next to her. \\"They've announced it!!\\" Writer Choi Nana urgently showed the phone screen. The SNS she had accessed was. -[Hello, this is the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (ATAS).] It was the official channel of the organization that oversees the 'Emmy Awards,' known as the 'Academy Awards' of the television industry. The Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (ATAS) had just posted an official announcement, and writer Choi Nana shouted out the key content. \\"The 'Emmy Awards'! They'll be held on August 1st!!\\" It meant there were less than two months left. Meanwhile, in Yeoncheon, Gyeonggi Province. About a hundred staff members were silently watching the filming zone. They were the production team of 'Beneficial Evil.' Producer Song Manwoo, with a serious expression, was watching a monitor focused on a person's face. \\".....\\" The person in the monitor was, of course, Kang Woojin. Currently embodying 'Jang Yeonwoo,' Woojin spoke even as he took off his suit jacket. \\"It's hot.\\" Inside the filming zone, he walked heavily towards the camera in front of him. His face was full of annoyance. The atmosphere of a weary office worker. As he got closer to the camera, he spoke his lines again. \\"Next—\\" He passed right by the camera. But the camera remained still. For about 5 seconds, silence spread throughout the set. Suddenly, everyone from Kang Woojin to the hundred staff members turned their gaze to Producer Song Manwoo. The bearded Producer Song Manwoo, who had been watching the monitor, said. \\"Cut!\\" He signaled briefly and stood up, exchanging glances with Kang Woojin. Then he gave a thumbs-up. \\"OK. Great work, and it was the best, Woojin.\\" Soon, the hundred staff members, as if on cue, started shouting, and Producer Song Manwoo approached Woojin, who was taking off his clothes, to shake hands. \\"I'm looking forward to 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain.'\\" Kang Woojin replied indifferently. \\"I'll see you at the 'Emmy Awards.'\\" The shooting for 'Beneficial Evil' Part 2 had ended. < Appearance (4) > End"},{"prompt":"< 조커 (1) > 촬영존에 선 '조커(Joker)'. 아니, 강우진, 사실 아직 진짜 '조커(Joker)'도 아니었다. 실제 촬영에 쓰일 의상 만 입고 있을 뿐이지, 얼굴 분장부터 헤어 등은 아직 투입되지 않았으니까. 지금의 우진은 그저 본 포스터 촬영 전 테스트를 위해 서 있을 뿐. 하지만 수백 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생' 스탭들이 보는, 눈이 휘둥그레질 카메라들이 집중하는 강우진을 응시하 는 노장 안가복 감독은. ‘이 나이에 오금이 저릴 줄이야, 아직 제대로 시작도 안 했는데 말이지. 이름 모를 격한 소름이 치솟았다. 그 소름엔 여러 가지가 포함됐다. 전율, 환희, 감동, 감격 등등. 물론, 오디션·스크린테스트 때도 우진이 직 접 준비한 의상을 보긴 했었다. 허나 정식으로 완성된 '조커(Joker)' 의상을 입은 강우진은 또 다른 느낌이었 다. 러프하던 게 명확해진 느낌? 거기다. '저놈이, 나를 발판 삼았던 배우가 헐리웃의 중심에 서 있다. 수많은 과정과 고초가 따랐지만, 어느새 우진은 여러 헐리웃 인물들이 집중하는 남주로서 저기 서 있었다. 이 순간을 상상 안 한 건 아니었지만, 막상 두 눈으로 직접보니 안가복 감독의 닭살은 끝없이 돋았다. 이는 강우진을 지켜보는 수백 외국인 스탭들도 비슷했다. 결이 다르긴 했다. 안가복 감독은 전율과 감동이었다면, 수백 스탭들은 감탄과 탄성이었다. 이상하진 않았 다. 우진의 오디션 때 모습을 본 이는 소수였고 여기 대부분 인원이 '조커(Joker)'인 그를 처음 봤으니까. 잠시간의 구경 타임. 안가복 감독은 현실 강우진과 모니터 속 그를 번갈아 체크했고, 수백 스탭들은 무던하게 선 우진을 계속해 서 눈에 담았다. 와중에 대단히 차분한 강우진의 모습에 고개를 갸웃하는 외국인 스탭도 꽤 많았다. '그나저나 상당히 여유로워, 전혀 떨리지 않는 건가?' '첫 촬영은 아니지만 모든 팀이 처음으로 전부 모였는데 편안하기 그지없군. 마치 십수 년간 여기 헐리웃 에서 굴러먹는 배우 같아' 헐리웃의 경험이 전무한 상태일 텐데도 그의 자세는 전혀 흐트러지지 않았다. 심히 정적. 파도 한 점 안 치 는 고요한 바다 같은 분위기. 그러나 이는 모두의 오해였다. 강우진은 현재. '와- 씨! 저 카메라는 뭐냐??!’ 퍽 흥분한 상태였다. 극한의 신기함이 팽배했으니까. ‘저기 저 차에 달린 카메라는 졸라 크네! 무슨 탱크냐??' 솔직히 지금 그는 촬영보단 구경하는 재미에 더 푹 빠졌다. 사실, 이 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오' 세트장에 도착했 을 때부터 그랬다. 강렬한 컨셉질로 인해 표정엔 변화가 없었지만, 여기까지 강우진은 최소 10번 이상은 내 면으로 괴성을 질러댔다. 헐리웃의 촬영장은 상상을 훌쩍 뛰어넘었으니까. 일단 전체적 규모부터 터무니없었고 수백 외국인 스탭 하며, 듣도보도 못 한 촬영 장비들과 현장에 설치된 부수적인 것들이 그랬다. 오늘 할당된 트레일러를 경험한 우진은 저도 모르게 겉으로 탄성을 뱉을 뻔했었다. ‘퀄리티 미쳤었지, 시바 무슨 소형 호텔인 줄.' 한국에선 보기 힘든 것들이 여기엔 평범하게 즐비했다. 구경하는 맛이 상당해서인지 시간이 녹았다. 어느 새 강우진은 포스터 촬영 직전에 놓였으니. 어쨌든 한창 구경하던 우진에게 늙은 목소리가 들렸다. \\"테스트 샷부터 가봅시다.” 안가복 감독이었다. 확성기를 통한 사인이라 강우진은 금방 고개를 끄덕였다. 포스터 콘티는 사전에 설명 받았고, 지금껏 여러 작품을 하며 수많은 포스터 촬영을 해온 우진이었다. 그래도 낯선 환경에 수백 외국인 들이 앞에 있다 보니.

'삐에로:빌런의 탄생'의 인서트, 포스터 및 테스트가 가미된 촬영은 늦은 오후가 돼서야 정리됐다. 마무리 되자마자 강우진은 빠졌지만, 안가복 감독 포함 키스탭들은 바로 '컬럼비아 스튜디오'에 모여 최종 미팅을 진행했다. 바로 내일이 정식 크랭크인이었으니까. 이 시각, 호텔로 이동하는 승합차 안의 강우진은 핸드폰을 보고 있었다. 스타일리스트들이 넘겨준 사진이 출력되는 중. 포스터 촬영 때 ‘조커(Joker)'의 모습이었다. '크- 이거 뭔가 지리는데? 웅장해.' 속으로 감탄하는 그였고 팀원들 전부도 마찬가지였다. \\"아우! 진짜 이 모습 바로 우진 오빠 인스타에 올려야 되는데!!\\" “그러니까! 올리자마자 난리 날 건데! 스포 때문에 올리지 못하는 게 한이다!\\" “근데 분장, 메이크업 대박이지 않아요? 우진 오빠 안 같아. 그냥 현실에 '조커(Joker)'가 있는 거 같아요.\\" “인정. 아까 분장 마친 오빠가 딱 나오는데 소름 돋았잖아요 저.\\" “이 모습이 포스터로 나와서 전세계로 퍼진다는 거죠?? 기대된다 진심!\\" 꽁지머리 최성건도 사진을 보며 만족의 미소를 짓고 있었다. 뭐 다분히 이해되는 현상이었다. 강우진 본인 도 분장을 거친 뒤 얼굴을 보고 심히 화들짝 놀랐으니까. 물론, 내면으로만. ‘이걸 아빠, 엄마가 보면 뭐라고 하실라나?' 그의 부모만이 아닌, 강우진을 아는 모든 이들은 입을 쩍 벌리겠지. 와중에 헐리웃 많은 인물들 역시 내일을 생각하며 움직이고 있었다. 어마무시한 돈을 들이부은 ‘컬럼비아 스튜디오'의 높으신 양반들이나. “내일은 모두 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생' 촬영장부터 나가는 거로 하지.” “아침부터였지? 물론, 가서 확인해야 해. 강우진의 연기는 물론, 그의 ‘조커(Joker)' 모습을 보면 대충 감이 잡힐 테니까.” \\"후- '삐에로:빌런의 탄생'은 무조건 잘 돼야 돼. 긴장되는군.\\" “나도 마찬가지야, 그러나 ‘시네마틱 유니버스’의 시작은 두 눈으로 봐 둬야지.\\" '삐에로:빌런의 탄생' 대본리딩에 참여한, 강우진의 '적당히'한 연기를 목도한 헐리웃 배우들. “내일 ‘삐에로:빌런의 탄생' 촬영장에 가겠다고? 크랭크인 날이라 기념적이긴 하지만, 촬영분도 없는데 굳 이 가야 될 이유가 있어?\\" \\"나뿐만이 아니야, 다른 배우들도 많이들 간다고 했어. 강우진이 리딩 때 보였던 것들이 진짜인지 허세인 지 궁금하잖아?\\" \\"말했잖아, 그건 초반 자신감을 높이기 위한 객기 비슷한 거라고. 물론, 대본리딩 때의 강우진 연기는 대단 했지만, 그보다 더한 무언가가 나올 거라는 건 상상되지 않아.\\" “다들 비슷하게 생각하는 거 같긴 하던데- 크리스나 감독의 반응이 마음에 걸려, 어찌보면 강우진의 행동 은 꽤 거만했는데 전혀 아무렇지 않게 인정해버렸다고.” 더불어 마일리 카라 포함 '야수와 미녀'에 관련된 배우들, 조셉 펠튼과 ‘존 페르소나’의 인원들. 아니, 헐리웃 전체가 강우진을 떠들어댔다. 부정적이든, 긍정적이든 각자 입맛에 맞춰 말이다. 이쯤 강우진은. -푹. 아공간에 진입했다. -[11/시나리오(제목: '삐에로:빌런의 탄생'), EX+급] \\"오늘 몇 번 리딩(경험)하고 자야겠다.” '헨리 고든’의 선명도를 수 배는 끌어올리기 위함이었다. 다음 날, 11일. 폭우가 쏟아지는 중이었다. 얼마나 빗줄기가 두꺼운지, 거리에 다니는 사람이 없을 정도. 당연했다. 이런 날엔 집에 박혀 TV나 보는 것이 상책이니까. -쿠구구궁! 귀가 울리는 천둥도 섞인다. 덕분에 인적은 드물지만, 인도를 걷는 한 남자가 눈에 띈다. 검은색 후드집업 에 청바지 차림. 후드를 머리에 써서 얼굴은 보이지 않았다. 다만, 특이한 점은. -터벅터벅. 걷는 거의 걸음걸이가 빈약하다는 것, 허리와 어깨가 굽었다는 것, 전체적인 분위기가 오묘하게 소름이 돋 는다는 것. 이 폭우를 대놓고 맞으면서도 걷는 속도가 느리다. 그것만으로도 요상했다. 남자가 멈춘 곳은 한 피자집 앞이었다. \\".....\\" 허름하기 짝이 없는 간판을 올려보는 그. 폐업했다 봐도 이상하지 않을 형태의 간판이었다. 남자가 움찔댄 다. 후드 주머니에 박은 두 손을 뺐다가 다시 넣는다. 걸음을 뗐다가 멈췄다. 뒤로 몸을 돌렸다가 다시 복귀 했다. 멍청하게 간판을 다시 올려본다. 뭘 하는 거지? 한눈에 봐도 고뇌와 고민이 서린 몸짓과 행동이었다. 하지만 결국 남자는. -스윽. 열리 꺼려질 정도로 오래된 피자집의 철문을 열었다. 괴기한 끼익 소음이 퍼졌다. 내부엔 사람 대화 소리 가 크게 울리고 있었다. 아니, TV 소리였다. 그 TV 앞에 앉아 낄낄대는 뚱뚱한 사내. 한 손에 맥주를 들었다. 사내가 깜짝 놀라 고개를 돌렸다. 후드를 쓴 남자가 서 있다. 빗물이 뚝뚝 떨어진다. 뚱뚱한 사내가 미간을 구겼다. \\"뭐야, 너! 오늘 영업 안 해! 꺼져!\\" 다시 천둥이 울렸다. -쿠구구구구궁! 동시에 후드 남자가 누군지 알아챈 뚱뚱한 사내. 맥주병을 놓으며 그가 스르륵 일어났다. \\"너- 헨리? 헨리 고든 맞지? 너 이 자식 여긴 왜 왔어.\\" 헨리 고든이란 이름을 뱉은 뚱뚱한 사내의 얼굴이 단숨에 풀렸다. 솟았던 긴장이 풀렸기 때문. 하지만 후드 남자. 즉, 헨리 고든이라 불린 남자는 미동도 없다. \\".....\\" 지금 그의 머릿속엔 여러 감정이 휘몰아치는 중이었으니까. 괄시, 핍박, 차별, 편견, 멸시. 아- 몰라, 엿이나 먹으라지. 굽은 어깨의 남자는, '헨리 고든’이 후드 주머니에 쑤신 두 손을 꼼지락거렸다. 뚱뚱한 사내가 고개를 갸웃 했다. \\"뭐냐 그거.” ‘헨리 고든’의 입에서 괴상한 웃음이 들렸다. \\"프흐흐!\\" \\"???\\" \\"너한테는 비극, 나에겐 희극\\" “뭐? 뭐라는 거야 미친놈이!” 뚱뚱한 사내가 고함쳤다.

He was only wearing the costume that would be used for the actual shooting, but his face makeup and hair had not yet been applied. At the moment, Woojin was simply standing there for a test before the main poster shoot. However, Director An Gabok, who was watching Kang Woojin, the focus of hundreds of 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' staff and numerous cameras, felt a chill run down his spine, even though the real shooting hadn't even started. An intense shiver ran through him. That shiver included various feelings: thrill, ecstasy, emotion, and admiration, among others. Of course, he had seen Woojin in the costume he prepared himself during the audition and screen test. But Kang Woojin, dressed in the officially completed 'Joker' costume, gave off a different vibe. Was it a feeling of roughness becoming clarity? Moreover, 'That guy, the actor who used me as a stepping stone, is now standing at the center of Hollywood.' Despite the many challenges and hardships, Woojin was now standing there as the male lead, the focus of various Hollywood figures. Director An Gabok had imagined this moment, but seeing it with his own eyes made his skin crawl endlessly. The hundreds of foreign staff watching Kang Woojin felt similarly. Their reactions were different, though. While Director An Gabok felt thrill and emotion, the hundreds of staff were filled with admiration and exclamations. It wasn't strange. Only a few had seen Woojin's audition, and most of the people here were seeing him as the 'Joker' for the first time. A brief moment of spectacle. Director An Gabok alternated between checking the real Woojin and the one on the monitor, while the hundreds of staff continued to observe the composed Woojin. Among them, quite a few foreign staff tilted their heads at Woojin's remarkably calm demeanor. 'He's quite relaxed, isn't he shaking at all?' 'It's not the first shoot, but it's the first time the whole team has gathered, and he couldn't be more comfortable. He's like an actor who's been rolling around Hollywood for over a decade.' Despite having no experience in Hollywood, his posture was not disturbed at all. It was extremely quiet. The atmosphere was like a calm sea without a single wave. But this was all a misunderstanding. Kang Woojin was currently, 'Wow—what's with that camera??!’ Quite excited. He was overwhelmed with extreme curiosity. 'That camera attached to that car is freaking huge! Is it a tank or what?' Honestly, he was more engrossed in the fun of observing than in the shooting. In fact, he had been like this since he arrived at this 'Columbia Studio' set. His expression showed no change due to his intense concept, but up to this point, Woojin had internally screamed at least ten times. The Hollywood filming set far exceeded his imagination. Firstly, the sheer scale was outrageous, with hundreds of foreign staff, unheard-of filming equipment, and additional installations on the set. Having experienced the assigned trailer for the day, Woojin almost let out an exclamation. 'The quality was insane, damn, it was like a small hotel.' Things that were hard to see in Korea were commonplace here. The time melted away as he enjoyed the sights. Before he knew it, Kang Woojin was ready for the poster shoot. Anyway, while he was busy observing, an elderly voice reached him. \\"Let's start with the test shots.\\" It was Director An Gabok. The signal came through a loudspeaker, so Woojin quickly nodded. He had been briefed on the poster continuity beforehand, and having done numerous poster shoots for various projects, he was experienced. However, with the unfamiliar environment and hundreds of foreigners in front of him, 'Ah, this is a bit embarrassing.' He felt awkward. But, \\"High—cue.\\" As soon as the shooting started, as if to say he couldn't care less about the embarrassment, Kang Woojin on the crosswalk assumed various poses nonchalantly. Running, walking, brushing back his hair, jumping with his arms spread wide, showing the middle finger straight ahead, tap dancing, and many more. By the way, the poster for 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' featured only Kang Woojin. All the posters to be produced, starting with the promotional ones, were planned to be like that. Although other actors' faces would be inserted in the release posters, Kang Woojin would dominate the entire poster. After several minutes of test shooting, Director An Gabok seemed satisfied. \\"That's enough, let's do the makeup.\\" He gave the next instruction. Soon, Woojin left the filming zone, and the makeup team moved busily. It was time for him to transform into the real 'Joker.' About an hour later? While waiting and taking additional insert shots, Director An Gabok received a radio message. Kang Woojin's makeup was complete. Responding to bring him over, Director An Gabok gave instructions to the key staff to start the official poster shoot. Hundreds of staff moved in unison. And then, -Swish. The real 'Joker,' or rather, Kang Woojin, emerged among hundreds of foreigners, his shoes clacking as he walked. A red jacket and pants, a blue shirt, a yellow vest, worn brown shoes. The costume was the same. However, his face had changed 180 degrees. Starting with the wet-looking red hair. It was longer than Kang Woojin's original hair, covering his ears and reaching his chin. But the hair was just the beginning. \\"......\\" Woojin's face, heavy with indifference, was completely white. And that wasn't all. His eyes were drawn with sharp squares. The color was black. Red dots were placed on his eyebrows and the tip of his nose. Most striking, though, were the corners of his mouth. Kang Woojin's lips appeared several times thicker, as if torn into a smile. No, that was painted on. The blood-red lips were intense. It was natural, not artificial. The work of Hollywood's makeup team. Soon, starting with Director An Gabok, \\"......Huh-\\" All the foreign staff were captivated by Kang Woojin. Regardless, Woojin, with his wet red hair swaying, nonchalantly stood in front of numerous cameras. It was the same crosswalk as before, but this time he was the real 'Joker.' As Kang Woojin brushed back his fallen hair, -Swish. He took out a cigarette from his jacket pocket and put it in his mouth. Then, after exhaling a long stream of smoke, with the cigarette still in his mouth, \\"Huh-\\" He laughed as if his mouth was torn. In an instant, the movements of all the hundreds of staff froze. Why? Because they were intimidated by the 'Joker' laughing slyly right in front of them. \\".....\\" \\".....\\" They were petrified. Afterward, The insert, poster, and test shoots for 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' continued until late afternoon before wrapping up. Kang Woojin left as soon as it was over, but Director An Gabok and the key staff immediately gathered at 'Columbia Studio' for a final meeting. Because the official crank-in was the next day. At this time, Kang Woojin in the van heading to the hotel was looking at his phone. Photos sent by the stylists were being printed. They were of the 'Joker' during the poster shoot. \\"Wow—this is something else, isn't it? Majestic.\\" He admired inwardly, and all his team members felt the same. \\"Ah! We really need to post this look on Woojin oppa's Instagram right now!\\" \\"Exactly! It would cause a sensation if we posted it! It's a shame we can't because of spoilers!\\" \\"But the makeup, isn't it amazing? It doesn't look like Woojin oppa at all. It's like the 'Joker' is really here.\\" \\"Agreed. When oppa came out with the makeup done earlier, I got goosebumps.\\" \\"Thinking that this look will be on posters and spread all over the world?? I'm genuinely excited!\\" Choi Seonggeon with his ponytail also smiled in satisfaction as he looked at the photo. It was an understandable reaction. Even Kang Woojin himself was quite startled when he saw his face after the makeup. Of course, only inwardly. 'I wonder what mom and dad would say if they saw this?' Not just his parents, but everyone who knew Kang Woojin would be shocked. Meanwhile, many figures in Hollywood were also on the move, thinking about the next day. The high-ups at 'Columbia Studio' who had invested an enormous amount of money. \\"Tomorrow, everyone starts at the 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' filming site.\\" \\"It was from the morning, right? Of course, we have to go and check. Seeing Kang Woojin's acting and his 'Joker' look will give us a rough idea.\\" \\"Phew—'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' has to succeed. I'm nervous.\\" \\"Me too, but we have to see the start of the 'Cinematic Universe' with our own eyes.\\" The Hollywood actors who participated in the 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' script reading and witnessed Kang Woojin's 'moderate' performance. \\"Going to the 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain' set tomorrow? It's a memorable day since it's the crank-in, but why bother going when there's no footage to shoot?\\" \\"Not just me, many other actors said they're going too. They're curious whether what Kang Woojin showed during the reading was real or just a bluff.\\" \\"I told you, that was just bravado to boost his confidence at the beginning. Of course, Kang Woojin's acting during the script reading was impressive, but I can't imagine anything more than that.\\" \\"It seems many think similarly—but I'm concerned about Chris and the director's reactions. In a way, Kang Woojin's behavior was quite arrogant, but they acknowledged it without any issue.\\" Furthermore, actors related to 'Beauty and the Beast,' including Miley Kara, Joseph Felton, and the crew of 'John Persona.' No, all of Hollywood was buzzing about Kang Woojin. Whether negatively or positively, they all had their own opinions. At this point, Kang Woojin, -Thump. Entered a pocket dimension. -[11/Scenario (Title: 'Pierrot: The Birth of a Villain'), EX+ Grade] \\"I need to read (experience) this a few times before I sleep tonight.\\" It was to increase the clarity of 'Henry Gordon' several times over. The next day, the 11th. A torrential downpour was underway. The rain was so heavy that there were no people on the streets. It was expected. On such a day, it was best to stay home and watch TV. -Boom! Thunder mixed with the rain echoed in the ears. Despite the sparse human presence, a man walking on the sidewalk caught the eye. Dressed in a black hooded zip-up and jeans. His face was hidden by the hood over his head. However, what was peculiar was, -Thud thud. His walk was feeble, his waist and shoulders were bent, and the overall atmosphere eerily gave off chills. He walked slowly, openly facing the downpour. That alone was strange. The man stopped in front of a pizza shop. \\".....\\" He looked up at the shabby sign. It was in such a state that it wouldn't be surprising if it had gone out of business. The man flinched. He took his hands out of his hoodie pocket and then put them back in. He started to walk, then stopped. He turned around, then returned. He looked up at the sign stupidly again. What was he doing? At a glance, his movements and actions were filled with anguish and indecision. But in the end, the man, -Swish. Opened the rusty door of the pizza shop, which seemed reluctant to open. A creepy creaking noise spread. Inside, the sound of people talking loudly echoed. No, it was the TV. A fat man sitting in front of the TV, giggling with a beer in one hand. The man was startled and turned his head. The hooded man was standing there. Raindrops fell from him. The fat man furrowed his brow. \\"What the hell, you! We're not open today! Get lost!\\" Thunder roared again. -Boom! At the same time, the fat man recognized who the hooded man was. He put down the beer bottle and slowly stood up. \\"You—Henry? Henry Gordon, right? Why the hell are you here, you bastard.\\" The fat man's face relaxed as he uttered the name Henry Gordon. The tension he had felt dissipated. But the hooded man, or rather, Henry Gordon, called by that name, did not move. \\".....\\" His mind was swirling with various emotions. Contempt, oppression, discrimination, prejudice, disdain. Ah—forget it, eat shit. The man with the bent shoulders, 'Henry Gordon,' fidgeted with his hands in his hoodie pocket. The fat man tilted his head. \\"What's that?\\" A strange laugh came from 'Henry Gordon.' \\"Pffh!\\" \\"???\\" \\"To you, it's a tragedy; to me, it's a comedy.\\" \\"What? What are you saying, you crazy bastard!\\" The fat man yelled. 'Henry Gordon' flinched his shoulders. It wasn't because he was intimidated. It was because of the liberation bursting from his core. He took something out of his hoodie pocket. Something silver. It was a gun. Then, in the pizza shop, \\"Hey! You!!\\" A chaotic noise erupted. Beer bottles shattered, chairs toppled, various objects spilled, something broke, and gunshots drowned out by the thunder rang out. -Bang bang! Someone with a hefty body hit the floor. -Thud!! Suddenly, only 'Henry Gordon' was left standing in the pizza shop. He was panting. His face was covered in flour, making it white. He looked down at the lump of meat sprawled on the floor. Nonchalantly. -Bang bang bang! He fired a few more bullets into the lump of meat. With a smile on his face. \\".....Heh.\\" Suddenly, a large camera slowly attached itself in front of 'Henry Gordon,' or Kang Woojin. -Swish. His figure was captured poignantly on several monitors. And at least 200 foreigners were watching those monitors. Hollywood actors were mixed in. '.....Crazy.' Everyone held their breath. < Joker (1) > End"},{"prompt":"Какой идеальный рост девушки для парня 182 см","completion":"Идеальный рост девушки для парня высотой 182 см является субъективным вопросом и зависит от личных предпочтений каждого человека.

One common method is to use NDI (Network Device Interface), which is a network-based video and audio transmission protocol that doesn't require physical capture cards. To attempt to set up an OBS stream from your main desktop PC to the Orange Pi B3, follow these general steps: 1. **Install OBS Studio on both PCs** - Ensure that you have OBS Studio installed on your main desktop and on your Orange Pi. OBS is available for multiple Linux distributions; since the Orange Pi B3 likely runs on some form of Linux, you will need to find an ARM-compatible version or compile it from source. 2. **Install NDI Plugin** - On your main PC, download and install the NDI Plugin for OBS. You can find the plugin and the installation instructions on OBS's official website or GitHub page. 3. **Configure OBS on Your Main PC** - After installing the NDI plugin, a new NDI output option will appear in the Tools menu in OBS. From here, you can configure your main PC to send its OBS output over the network via NDI. 4. **NDI Tools** - On the Orange Pi B3, you'll likely need to use the NDI runtime and SDK to compile or run NDI Tools, if they are not readily available pre-compiled for your device's architecture. Depending on the OS you are running, you may face challenges here as most NDI Tools are built for x86 architectures and might not be directly compatible with ARM. 5. **Receive NDI Stream on Orange Pi B3** - Once you have NDI working on your Orange Pi, you would configure OBS to receive the NDI stream as a source. This typically involves adding an \\"NDI Source\\" to your scene and selecting the NDI stream that your main PC is broadcasting. 6. **Streaming Settings** - After adding the NDI source, you would then set up your streaming settings on the Orange Pi B3. In OBS, go to Settings > Stream, and enter your streaming service and stream key. 7. **Start Streaming** - With everything set up, you would then start the stream on OBS on the Orange Pi B3, which would encode and broadcast the NDI stream it's receiving from your main PC. Please take note that the performance and actual ability to stream efficiently will depend highly on the Orange Pi B3's CPU and network capabilities. Encoding and streaming, especially at higher resolutions like 1080p or 4K, can be quite demanding, and the Orange Pi B3 may struggle with this task. If you discover that the Orange Pi B3 is not performing well as a streaming PC, you might need to consider using a more powerful system for encoding or lowering the quality settings (resolution, bitrate, encoding preset, etc.) to match the capabilities of the hardware."},{"prompt":"i would need an ethernet cable and a switch to connect both the main pc and the orange pi?","completion":"Yes, to establish a reliable network connection suitable for video streaming between your main desktop PC and the Orange Pi B3, you would typically need the following: 1. **Ethernet Cables**: You should have at least two Ethernet cables: one to connect your main desktop PC to the network and another to connect the Orange Pi B3 to the network. Ethernet provides a more stable and faster connection than Wi-Fi, which is important for the bandwidth and latency requirements of live video streaming. 2. **Network Switch or Router**: This device will manage the network traffic between your two PCs. Both devices should be connected to the switch/router, which then coordinates the data transfer between them. If you're also connecting to the internet for streaming to a service like Twitch or YouTube, the switch would be connected to your broadband modem or router. The setup would generally look like this: \`\`\` Main PC <----Ethernet Cable----> Network Switch/Router <----Ethernet Cable----> Orange Pi B3 ^ | Broadband Modem (if also streaming to the internet) \`\`\` When setting up your network, make sure that: - Both PCs are on the same local network. This means they should be in the same subnet so they can communicate with each other and the NDI stream can be discovered by the receiving device. - If applicable, configure your firewall and network settings to allow NDI traffic. NDI uses a set of TCP/UDP ports that need to be unblocked for discovery and video streaming. - The bandwidth of your local network is sufficient for NDI streaming. NDI can be quite bandwidth-intensive, especially at higher resolutions and frame rates. A Gigabit Ethernet network (1000 Mbps) is highly recommended to ensure that you have enough bandwidth available for a smooth streaming experience. - Ensure that your network switch/router can handle the traffic. For the best performance, you would want a switch that supports Gigabit Ethernet on all ports. After setting up the hardware, you would then proceed to configure OBS and NDI as described in the previous answer to establish the stream from your main PC to the Orange Pi B3."},{"prompt":"Err","completion":"Hello!

Пользователь: Анализ главы \\"Тамань\\" Из романа герой нашего времени лермонтова Ты: Глава “Тамань” из романа Михаила Юрьевича Лермонтова “Герой нашего времени” – одна из пяти воспоминательных повестей, рассказывающая об одном из эпизодов жизни главного героя Печорина. Это повествование отличается от остальных глав своим мистическим и призрачным настроением и демонстрирует сложность и двуличность характера Печорина.<br/><br/>В “Тамани” Печорин описывает своё короткое пребывание в маленьком морском поселке Тамань, где он по пути в Грузию намеревался переправиться через море. Несмотря на кажущуюся прозаичность цели его поездки, Печорин сталкивается с рядом странных событий и фигур, которые придают этой главе атмосферу готического романа.<br/><br/>Так, здесь встречаются три загадочных персонажа: слепой мальчик, который читает сны и играет на гармони; девушка-контрабандист, испытывающая к Печорину двойственные чувства; загадочный рыбак, которого Печорин заподозрил в контрабанде. Ощущение таинственности усиливается ещё и тем, что все герои появляются в неожиданных ситуациях и обладают некоторыми странными чертами.<br/><br/>“Тамань” — это также рассказ о человеческом обмане и самообмане. Печорин, несмотря на свою проницательность и аналитический ум, оказывается в ловушке собственного заблуждения, веря в реальность увиденного “двойника” на море, который оказывается простым призрачным отражением лунного света.<br/><br/>Глава выделяется в романе также своим поэтическим языком и мрачным ландшафтом, становясь в некотором смысле отражением внутреннего мира Печорина, полного противоречий, тайн и не реализованных эмоций. Море, скалы, непогода создают фон, атмосферу подавленности и одиночества, который идеально подходит к размышлениям героя о себе и своём месте в мире.<br/><br/>Анализируя “Тамань”, стоит также упомянуть об основной теме всего романа — поиске Печорином смысла жизни и истины, его непримиримой натуре и бессильности перед обыденностью, которую он пытается разрушить, вступая в конфликт со всем вокруг и в первую очередь с самим собой.

Светлые воспоминания о цирке начинаются с момента, когда в руках оказывалась пестрая брошюра с анонсами предстоящих выступлений, и взрослые обещали скорый поход на удивительное представление.<br/><br/>В воздухе витал дух приключений и радости, когда мы, держась за руки родителей, ступали под ярко украшенный цирковой шатёр. Запах попкорна и сладкой ваты смешивался с ароматами лошадей и мощи слонов, образуя неповторимый коктейль ощущений, который запомнится на всю жизнь.<br/><br/>Свет огней над ареной привлекал взгляд, заставлял забыть обо всём на свете. А детский смех сливался с оживлёнными разговорами зрителей, которые с нетерпением ожидали начала представления. Клоуны с розовыми носами, акробаты, выполняющие невообразимые трюки на головокружительной высоте, и грациозные гимнасты создавали атмосферу, где реальность казалась чем-то недостижимым.<br/><br/>Каждый номер цирка напоминал небольшое чудо: дрессированные животные удивляли разум своим послушанием, а фокусники заставляли сомневаться в собственных глазах. А как же аплодисменты! Они гремели в ушах, создавая чувство причастности к чему-то великолепному.<br/><br/>Поход в цирк в нашем детстве был символом радости, восторга и неподдельного удивления. Эти моменты остаются навсегда в памяти, как напоминание о том, что мир полон тайн и магии, достаточно лишь взглянуть на него детскими глазами. Подаренные впечатления живут в сердце, вспыхивая тёплым светом в моменты ностальгии. Пользователь: Россия - страна возможностей!

Я люблю лето по множеству причин, и каждая из них делает это время года особенным и незаменимым.<br/><br/>Во-первых, лето приносит с собой тепло и солнце, которые пробуждают после долгой зимы всё живое. С первыми летними днями природа вокруг оживает, наполняясь яркими красками и ароматами цветущих растений. Долгие дни и короткие ночи создают идеальные условия для приключений и открытий.<br/><br/>Лето — это также время отдыха и разрешения от обычного графика учёбы или работы. Школьные каникулы дают свободу для игр на свежем воздухе, поездок к морю, пикников с друзьями и семьёй. Можно забыть о будильнике и дать себе разгул в развлечениях и путешествиях.<br/><br/>Я люблю лето за возможность заняться спортом на улице. Будь то катание на велосипеде, плавание в бассейне или море, футбол в парке — все эти активности приносят радость и помогают поддерживать здоровье и хорошее настроение. Нет ничего лучше, чем ощущение свежего ветра во время утренней пробежки или вдыхание аромата леса во время похода.<br/><br/>Летом природа предоставляет массу даров, и я от души люблю ягоды и фрукты, которые созревают в это время. Клубника, малина, черешня — каждый плод наполнен солнечным светом и теплом, а их вкус и полезные свойства делают это время года незабываемым.<br/><br/>Также я восхищаюсь летними грозами и теплыми летними дождями, которые освежают воздух и приносят особое настроение. Шум дождя и впечатляющие молнии напоминают о мощи и красоте природы.<br/><br/>И, конечно же, лето — это идеальное время для чтения. С книгой в руках можно уединиться в парке под тенью деревьев или устроиться на пляже, погружаясь в другие миры и истории под шум волн.<br/><br/>Лето наполняет меня энергией, вдохновляет на новые идеи и планы. Это время, когда можно смело экспериментировать, пробовать новое и наслаждаться каждым моментом. Я влюблен в каждый летний день, в его неповторимость и очарование. Именно поэтому я так люблю лето — яркую, живую и полную чудес пору. Запрос пользователя (отвечай только на него, всё, что сказано выше, это только контекст): Что общего между праздниками августовских Спасов и в чем их различие","completion":"Августовские Спасы – это три православных праздника, которые отмечаются в августе и связаны с урожаем и концом лета. Это Спас на воде (Медовый Спас), Спас на горе (Яблочный Спас) и Третий Спас (Ореховый Спас). **Общее между августовскими Спасами:** 1. Все три Спаса отмечаются в августе и являются популярными народными праздниками в России и других странах с православной традицией. 2. Каждый из этих праздников связан с сельскохозяйственными работами и отмечанием завершения определённого этапа уборки урожая. 3. Все три праздника имеют и религиозное значение, и народные традиции, включающие в себя определённые обряды и приметы. **Различия между августовскими Спасами:** 1. **Медовый Спас (14 августа)**: первый Спас, который отмечается в честь окончания сбора меда. В этот день освящается мёд нового урожая, а также вода в храмах. 2. **Яблочный Спас (19 августа)**: второй Спас и самый известный, который совпадает с праздником Преображения Господня. В этот день традиционно освящают яблоки и другие фрукты, отмечая начало сбора яблочного урожая. 3. **Ореховый Спас (29 августа)**: третий Спас, также известный как Третий Спас или Спас на полотне, связан с окончанием уборки зерновых и созреванием орехов. В этот день освящают орехи, а также отмечают Успение Пресвятой Богородицы.

Replace with T2 or T3 accordingly. figure set(gcf,'Color',[1 1 1]) for x = 1:column_im for y = 1:row_im % Transform the point (x,y,1) using the transformation matrix T original_point = [x; y; 1]; transformed_point = T * original_point; % Extract the transformed coordinates x_transformed = transformed_point(1); y_transformed = transformed_point(2); z_transformed = transformed_point(3); % Plot the transformed point if im(y, x) == 255 plot3(x_transformed, y_transformed, z_transformed, 'w.') grid on else plot3(x_transformed, y_transformed, z_transformed, 'k.') end hold on drawnow end end % Release the hold on the plot hold off \`\`\` Please note that this code assumes that the transformation matrices T1, T2, and T3 are 3x3 matrices that are suitable for transforming 3D homogeneous points. If the matrices A1, A2, and A3 from which they are derived are not square and invertible, or the operation does not represent such a transformation, the matrices T1, T2, and T3 would not be valid for this operation and the pseudocode provided here will not work correctly. In that case, more complex methods such as pseudo-inverses or least-squares solutions must be used to properly compute the transformations. Furthermore, out-of-bound checks and normalization (if \`z_transformed\` is not 1 after the transformation) would be necessary for a fully functional transformation."},{"prompt":"the code above does not give the correct output. could you please try that code with 90 degree rotation in z-index for the T transformation matrix?","completion":"Sure, a 90-degree rotation around the z-axis in a 2D plane (assuming z is perpendicular to the x-y plane) is represented by the following 2D transformation matrix: \`\`\` cos(90) -sin(90) sin(90) cos(90) \`\`\` Since we are working with homogeneous coordinates to include translation in a 3x3 matrix for 2D transformations, the matrix looks like: \`\`\` [0 -1 0] [1 0 0] [0 0 1] \`\`\` The MATLAB code to apply a 90-degree rotation on the z-axis of each point of the image would be: \`\`\`matlab im = double(imread('./smile.png')); [row_im, column_im] = size(im); % 90-degree rotation matrix around the z-axis T = [0 -1 0; 1 0 0; 0 0 1]; figure set(gcf, 'Color', [1 1 1]) axis equal for x = 1:column_im for y = 1:row_im % Apply the transformation matrix to the point (x,y,1) transformed_point = T * [x; y; 1]; % Extract the transformed coordinates x_transformed = transformed_point(1); y_transformed = transformed_point(2); % Plot the transformed point if im(y, x) == 255 plot(x_transformed, y_transformed, 'w.') else plot(x_transformed, y_transformed, 'k.') end hold on end end % Release the hold on the plot hold off \`\`\` Please note the following in the code: - I removed the \`drawnow\` command for efficiency reasons; you can add it back if you need to see the image being drawn point-by-point. - The \`plot3\` function was replaced with \`plot\` since we are doing 2D plotting after the rotation transformation. The z-coordinate is homogeneous and does not affect the 2D plot in this case. - I added \`axis equal\` to maintain equal scale on x and y axes. Remember to replace \`./smile.png\` with the correct path to your image file. This script will take the image and rotate it by 90 degrees around the z-axis counterclockwise when looking down from the positive z-direction."},{"prompt":"请帮我写一封邮件，内容是询问编辑部我需要什么时候付发表文章的费用，付款的方式是什么？","completion":"主题：咨询文章发表费用支付时间及方式 尊敬的编辑部， 您好！ 我是[您的全名]，近期有幸投稿至您的期刊，并得到了接受发表的通知，对此我深感荣幸。在准备接下来的步骤中，我希望能够获取一些关于文章发表费用支付的详细信息。 首先，我想了解确认文章将要发表后，我应该在何时支付相应的费用？如果有具体的支付截止日期，请您告知，以便我能够及时安排。 此外，还请您提供发表费用的详细支付方式，比如接受银行转账、信用卡支付、PayPal或是其他电子支付方式等。同时，如果能提供包括收款账户信息、转账时需填写的参考信息、以及任何有关国际付款可能需要的银行代码或特殊指示，我将非常感谢。 如果有任何发票或正式的费用通知单等文档，烦请一并发送给我，以便我能够准确无误地完成支付，并为会计记录提供凭证。 感谢您的时间和帮助。期待您的回信，并期望我的文章能够顺利发表。 祝好， [您的全名] [您的联系信息：包括邮箱地址、电话号码等] [您的附属机构，如有] [提交文章的标题或稿件编号，如有] 请根据实际情况填写相关信息，并适当调整邮件内容以适应具体场合和对方的沟通风格。"},{"prompt":"请用俄语","completion":"Тема: Запрос информации о времени и способе оплаты за публикацию статьи Уважаемая редакция, Здравствуйте!
