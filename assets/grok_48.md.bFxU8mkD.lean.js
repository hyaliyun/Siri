Create a new Dart file (e.g., parent_child_page.dart) and add the following code: \`\`\`dart import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; class ParentChildPage extends StatefulWidget { @override _ParentChildPageState createState() => _ParentChildPageState(); } class _ParentChildPageState extends State<ParentChildPage> { // List to store parent-child group data List<GroupData> groupData = []; // Callback function to handle submitting the data entered by the user void submitData(String arabicName, String englishName) { GroupData newGroupData = GroupData(arabicName, englishName); setState(() { groupData.add(newGroupData); }); } @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { return DefaultTabController( length: 3, // Number of tabs child: Scaffold( appBar: AppBar( title: Text('Parent-Child Groups'), bottom: TabBar( tabs: [ Tab(text: 'Group 1'), Tab(text: 'Group 2'), Tab(text: 'Group 3'), ], ), ), body: TabBarView( children: [ // Tab 1 content GroupForm(submitData), // Tab 2 content GroupForm(submitData), // Tab 3 content GroupForm(submitData), ], ), ), ); } } class GroupData { String arabicName; String englishName; GroupData(this.arabicName, this.englishName); } class GroupForm extends StatelessWidget { final Function(String, String) onSubmit; GroupForm(this.onSubmit); final TextEditingController arabicNameController = TextEditingController(); final TextEditingController englishNameController = TextEditingController(); void submitForm() { final String arabicName = arabicNameController.text; final String englishName = englishNameController.text; onSubmit(arabicName, englishName); } @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { return Center( child: Padding( padding: EdgeInsets.all(16.0), child: Column( mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center, children: <Widget>[ TextField( controller: arabicNameController, decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'Arabic Name'), ), TextField( controller: englishNameController, decoration: InputDecoration(labelText: 'English Name'), ), ElevatedButton( onPressed: submitForm, child: Text('Submit'), ), ], ), ), ); } } \`\`\` 2. In your main.dart file, add the following code to see the UI: \`\`\`dart import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; import 'package:your_app_name/parent_child_page.dart'; void main() => runApp(MyApp()); class MyApp extends StatelessWidget { @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { return MaterialApp( title: 'Parent-Child UI Example', theme: ThemeData( primarySwatch: Colors.blue, visualDensity: VisualDensity.adaptivePlatformDensity, ), home: ParentChildPage(), ); } } \`\`\` In this example, the \`ParentChildPage\` class represents the main page containing the tabs. The \`GroupData\` class represents a model for storing the Arabic and English names. The \`GroupForm\` class represents the form displayed on each tab to input the data. The \`submitData\` function handles submitting the form data and updating the UI. With this code, each tab will have its own form to input the Arabic and English names, and when the user clicks the submit button, the data will be added to the \`groupData\` list and displayed on the respective tab."},{"prompt":"(In MC’s room…) MC: “Who could be knocking on the door now?” (MC opens the door - it was Natsuki, an angel.)

Marketing refers to the overall strategy and activities that a company undertakes to promote its products or services to customers. It encompasses identifying target markets, conducting market research, developing marketing strategies, creating advertising campaigns, and establishing a brand identity. Marketing is a broad discipline that involves analyzing consumer behavior, market trends, and competition in order to attract and retain customers. Business promotion, on the other hand, refers specifically to the techniques and tactics used to create awareness and generate interest in a company or its offerings. It includes activities such as advertising, public relations, sales promotions, trade shows, and direct marketing. Business promotion often focuses on specific initiatives or campaigns aimed at increasing sales, raising the company's profile, or launching new products or services.

I was excited about Vega. They touted it as good at gaming and great for compute. And I waited for it, mostly because I had my top-of-the-range 2-year-old Freesync monitor and wanted to keep using it. Vega is good for gaming, true, but not the best. I no longer care what future holds for DirectX 12 and Vulkan because few of the top games use that. I want existing software using DirectX 11 and OpenGL to work great on AMD. I cannot trust AMD on promises of great performances in DirectX 12 and Vulkan because their implementations of DirectX 11 and OpenGL has always been sub-optimal and often critisized. But I sure can trust a company that has always had great DirectX 11 and OpenGL implementations that they can make equally great DirectX 12 and Vulkan ones. Now that I do machine learning, I wanted to use my Vega for its much touted compute capability. All modern machine learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow/Keras, Caffe, Torch can use GPUs to dramatically speed up computations. They all support GPUs out of the box. It was a nasty surprise for me that they all expect the GPU to support CUDA. None of the frameworks can use OpenCL. AMD is trying to make these machine learning frameworks utilize AMD hardware, but the support is rather poor, see the current state of it over at Deep Learning on ROCm. AMD hardware and OpenCL are currently useless for machine learning, unless one is willing to build their own machine learning framework from scratch. The fact that I cannot use this record-breaking theoretical compute capability for machine learning is a failure of AMD, no one else's. Even more so because AMD was making a lot of noise about its machine learning capabilities and its Instinct series targeted specifically for machine learning. I am pretty sure now that AMD's \\"new era of Deep Learning\\" translates to \\"none of the existing deep learning software works with AMD\\". This is the point I am most unhappy about. What is the use of \\"World’s Fastest Training Accelerator for Machine Intelligence and Deep Learning\\" if little software can utilise that? IMO, AMD should be throwing money at popular projects to make them support AMD as a 1st class citizen. Just rage-swapped my RX Vega 64 LC for NVidia 1080Ti and thought I bricked my PC because I could not hear it. Turned out that the air-cooled 1080Ti at 2000MHz is much quieter than the liquid cooled RX Vega 64 LC at 1670Mhz. And the most amazing thing is that all GPU-accelerated software now just works. In Primitive Discarding in Vega: Mike Mantor Interview at 8:30 Mike says that Vega exceeds 1700MHz and they run it \\"at least 1700Mhz\\", however, I was not able to observe that in games, no. 1700Mhz is about the max my liquid cooled Vega can do when under-volted, with stock voltages it hovers around 1650MHz. The VRAM goes from 945Mhz to 1050MHz easily on my sample though, with no other adjustments. Just a bit unhappy that AMD marketing got me with their hot air. Stop saying that AMD marketing isn't good or effective. #makesomenoise","completion":"The author expresses disappointment with AMD's Radeon Vega GPU, citing false promises and subpar performance in DirectX 11 and OpenGL. They also highlight the lack of support for OpenCL in machine learning frameworks, making AMD hardware useless for such purposes.

They swapped their AMD GPU for an Nvidia 1080Ti, noting its quieter operation and compatibility with GPU-accelerated software.

Here are the general steps and considerations for implementing SAP PP in a dairy manufacturing company: 1. Define Objectives and Scope: Clearly define the objectives and scope of implementing SAP PP in your dairy manufacturing company. Identify pain points and desired outcomes, such as improved production planning, inventory management, and resource utilization. 2. Assemble Implementation Team: Form a team of key stakeholders, including representatives from various departments such as production, procurement, quality control, and IT. The team will be responsible for driving and managing the implementation process. 3. Conduct Gap Analysis: Analyze the current production processes, systems, and data in your dairy manufacturing company to identify gaps between the existing practices and the desired state with SAP PP. This will help determine the areas that need to be addressed during implementation. 4. Data Migration and Master Data Setup: Evaluate the existing data and ensure its accuracy and consistency. Cleanse and migrate relevant data into the SAP PP system, such as material master data, bills of materials, work centers, and production orders. 5. Configuration and Customization: Customize the SAP PP system to align with your dairy manufacturing company's specific requirements. Configure settings related to materials planning, routing, capacity planning, demand management, and shop floor control. 6. Training and Change Management: Provide comprehensive training to the end-users on how to use the SAP PP system effectively. Emphasize the benefits and impact the system will have on their daily tasks. Implement change management strategies to encourage acceptance and adoption of the new system. 7. Testing and Go-Live: Conduct thorough testing of the SAP PP system to ensure its functionality and integrity. Test various scenarios, such as production planning, capacity utilization, and order management. Once testing is successful, schedule the go-live date for the SAP PP implementation. 8. Post-Implementation Support: Provide ongoing support and maintenance after the go-live to address any issues, answer user queries, and make necessary adjustments. Continuously monitor and optimize the system based on user feedback to enhance performance and efficiency. It is recommended to work with an experienced SAP implementation partner or consultant who has expertise in both SAP PP and the dairy manufacturing industry.

Da millenni, le diverse culture hanno utilizzato la musica come forma di espressione, comunicazione e guarigione. La musicoterapia, un approccio terapeutico basato sull'utilizzo consapevole della musica, ha dimostrato di avere innumerevoli benefici per la salute mentale e fisica. Studi scientifici hanno evidenziato come la musica possa migliorare l'umore, ridurre lo stress, favorire il rilassamento e stimolare la creatività, tra gli altri vantaggi. Una delle caratteristiche uniche della musicoterapia è la sua accessibilità universale. Non importa la età, la cultura o l'esperienza musicale, la musica può raggiungere e coinvolgere ognuno. Può essere utilizzata sia in ambito clinico, come supporto nelle terapie tradizionali, sia come pratica personale per il benessere quotidiano. La musicoterapia può essere sperimentata in diverse forme e modalità. Una delle più comuni è l'ascolto consapevole della musica rilassante o curativa. Brani musicali appositamente selezionati, con melodie dolci e ritmi tranquillizzanti, aiutano a creare uno spazio tranquillo e sereno all'interno di noi stessi. Questa pratica può essere particolarmente utile per alleviare lo stress, combattere l'insonnia e migliorare la concentrazione. Altre forme di musicoterapia includono la creazione e l'improvvisazione musicale. Questo coinvolge attivamente il paziente o l'individuo, offrendo loro un modo per esprimersi, comunicare e superare sfide emotive o fisiche. Strumenti musicali, come chitarre, pianoforti, tamburi o anche il semplice utilizzo della voce, possono diventare canali attraverso cui liberare le proprie emozioni e trovare la guarigione interiore. In ambito clinico, la musicoterapia viene applicata in diverse discipline, come la riabilitazione, la psicoterapia e l'accompagnamento durante le cure palliative. I professionisti utilizzano la musica come strumento per creare un ambiente rassicurante, facilitare la comunicazione non verbale e stimolare il processo di guarigione, sia fisicamente che emotivamente. La musicoterapia non è solo un metodo terapeutico, ma anche un modo di connessione e condivisione, spingendoci a collegarci agli altri attraverso la musica. Gruppi di musicoterapia possono essere luoghi di incontro e sostegno, dove i partecipanti condividono esperienze e si aiutano reciprocamente attraverso la musica.

It must be exciting, though, to be welcoming triplets.” Natsuki: (smiling softly) “Yeah, it is. I never imagined becoming a mom so young, but I’ve come to embrace it. I’ve always loved kids, so having three little angels on the way is both daunting and amazing…especially since I’m an angel myself.” MC: “Wait, you’re an angel?

We need to get you to the hospital right away!” Natsuki: “But…what if my water breaks fully while on the way there?!” MC: “Don’t worry, Natsuki! We’ll figure it out. Just take deep breaths and try to stay calm.” Natsuki: “Okay…okay, I’ll try. But I’m so scared, MC.” MC: “I know it’s scary, Natsuki. But you’re not alone. I’ll be right here with you every step of the way. We’ll get through this together.” Natsuki: “Thank you, MC. I’m glad you’re here.” MC: “Alright, let’s quickly grab your things and head to the car. We’ll call an ambulance on the way, just in case.” Natsuki: “Okay, let’s go.” (MC and Natsuki rush out of the room, making their way to the car. Natsuki is in discomfort, but MC does their best to keep her calm throughout the journey to the hospital. But just before they exit the house, Natsuki’s water breaks fully.) Natsuki: “Oh my god!

Hang on, let me call for an ambulance!” Natsuki: “No time, MC!

Your friendship means the world to me.\\" (As the days pass, Natsuki adjusts to life as a mother of three. She breastfeeds her babies, cuddles them, and gives them all the love she possibly can. MC continues to support and help her whenever needed.) MC: \\"Natsuki, watching you with your daughters is truly heartwarming. You were meant to be a mother.\\" Natsuki: (blushing) \\"Thank you, MC. That means a lot to me.\\" (MC and Natsuki spend countless hours together, creating cherished memories and strengthening their bond.

Le seul truc dont je veux que tu tiennes compte c'est qu'on suivra notre héros en l'an 307, il aura eté élevé par son père adoptif dans une dimension où se trouve la baleine monde, une créature capable d'inonder le monde par ses pleurs. Détaille bien chaque ère y comprit la création","completion":"Bien sûr ! Voici un aperçu de l'univers que je peux imaginer pour toi : Ère de la Création : Au commencement, le monde était plongé dans les ténèbres. Les dieux se sont réveillés et ont uni leurs forces pour créer une réalité nouvelle. Ils ont donné naissance à la Baleine Monde, une créature immense capable d'inonder le monde avec ses pleurs. La Baleine Monde a ainsi donné naissance à toutes les formes de vie, des terres fertiles aux océans profonds. Ère des Royaumes : Pendant des siècles, les différentes races prospéraient en harmonie. Les elfes, les nains, les humains, les créatures magiques et bien d'autres peuples cohabitaient pacifiquement. Chaque race avait son propre royaume, régi par des dirigeants sages et puissants. Mais des tensions commencèrent à apparaître, menant à des guerres et à la fracture de l'unité qui régnait autrefois. Ère des Légendes : Les conflits entre les royaumes et les créatures magiques se sont intensifiés. Des héros légendaires ont émergé, dotés de pouvoirs et d'armes magiques leur permettant de défendre leurs terres. Des intrigues politiques, des trahisons et des batailles épiques ont façonné cette époque turbulente, laissant derrière elles de nombreuses histoires héroïques et tragiques. Ère des Cataclysmes : Une série de catastrophes ont frappé le monde, provoquant d'immenses bouleversements. Des tremblements de terre, des éruptions volcaniques et des tempêtes dévastatrices ont ravagé de nombreux royaumes. Les races ont été contraintes de se battre pour leur survie, et la magie elle-même a été altérée, devenant plus instable et imprévisible. Ère des Révolutions : Après la destruction et le chaos, les peuples ont finalement réussi à se stabiliser. De nouveaux royaumes se sont formés et des alliances ont été forgées. Les héros sont devenus des légendes et des nouvelles générations ont émergé, guidées par des idéaux de paix et de coopération. Mais des tensions subsistaient entre les races et la magie. Ère de l'Ascension : L'an 307 marque l'entrée dans une nouvelle ère, où ton héros se révèle. Élevé par son père adoptif dans une dimension où se trouve la Baleine Monde, il découvre qu'il possède un pouvoir unique : la capacité de communiquer avec la créature et d'influencer ses pleurs. Il se lance ainsi dans un voyage périlleux à travers le monde, cherchant à rétablir l'équilibre entre les forces magiques et à prévenir une inondation cataclysmique. Au cours de son périple, ton héros rencontrera des alliés et des ennemis, explorera des lieux mystérieux et découvrira des secrets enfouis depuis des siècles. Il devra comprendre les enjeux politiques et les conflits entre les races, tout en se confrontant à des entités maléfiques cherchant à exploiter le pouvoir de la Baleine Monde. Sa quête l'amènera à redéfinir les fondements de l'univers et à construire un avenir où la coexistence pacifique et la magie retrouveront leur place d'honneur."},{"prompt":"(In MC’s room…) MC: “Who could be knocking on the door now?” (MC opens the door - it was Natsuki, an angel.)

Confirm that this is the table causing the error. 2. Validate the data in the \\"delivery2_address_floor\\" column: Check the data that you are trying to insert into the \\"delivery2_address_floor\\" column for the row at line 570187. Ensure that the data is not missing and is properly formatted. In this case, the data value should exist and should also not be empty. 3.

Симптомы СРК могут быть разнообразными, но наиболее характерными являются боли и дискомфорт в нижней части живота, которые облегчаются после дефекации. У пациентов с преобладанием запоров частота и объем стула снижены, а сам процесс дефекации затруднен. С другой стороны, у пациентов с преобладанием диареи частота и объем стула увеличены, а дефекация может быть неожиданной и неуправляемой. Причины возникновения СРК до конца не известны, но считается, что факторы, такие как стресс, пищевые привычки, изменения в микробиоме кишечника и гиперчувствительность кишечника, могут способствовать его развитию. Лечение СРК включает изменение образа жизни и диеты, управление стрессом, прием лекарственных препаратов для облегчения симптомов (например, антидиарейных или противозапорных препаратов) и применение психотерапии для помощи в управлении стрессом и тревогой. Важно проконсультироваться с врачом для установления точного диагноза и разработки индивидуального плана лечения."},{"prompt":"Ecrire une lettre de motivation répndant à l'annonce qui se situe sur ce site : https://fr.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=c7e4f0bb0d088996&q=dispositifs+m%C3%A9dicaux&l=Gironde&tk=1h5braip4kbb1801&from=ja&alid=642216f46a3286602d2099f2&utm_campaign=job_alerts&utm_medium=email&utm_source=jobseeker_emails&rgtk=1h5braip4kbb1801 .

La realidad no es estática ni un simple conjunto de objetos y fenómenos, sino que está compuesta por una red de relaciones y conexiones entre los distintos elementos que la conforman. Además, para Zubiri, la realidad no es algo independiente del sujeto que la percibe, sino que está condicionada por nuestra forma de conocerla y comprenderla.

Хранение данных в виде отдельной таблицы в БД: В этом случае вы можете создать новую таблицу в вашей БД и импортировать данные из Excel в эту таблицу. Каждый столбец в таблице будет соответствовать столбцу в Excel, и каждая строка будет соответствовать строке в Excel. Если вам нужно только хранение и просмотр данных, этот метод будет простым и эффективным. 2. Хранение данных в реляционной БД: Если у вас есть связанные данные или требуется более сложная структура данных, вы можете использовать реляционную БД (например, MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite и т.д.). В этом случае вы можете создать несколько связанных таблиц, чтобы хранить данные, и использовать отношения (связи) между таблицами для объединения, фильтрации и извлечения данных. 3. Хранение данных в формате CSV или JSON: Если вам просто нужно сохранить данные из Excel и использовать их для дальнейшей обработки на разных платформах или инструментах, вы можете сохранить таблицу в формате CSV или JSON и хранить этот файл в базе данных в виде BLOB (Binary Large Object).

Technical analysis involves analyzing historical price and volume patterns to predict future price movements. Here are a few popular technical analysis tools that can be applied to Bitcoin: 1. Support and Resistance Levels: Identify key price levels where the Bitcoin price tends to find support (buying pressure) or resistance (selling pressure). These levels can be drawn based on historical price movements and used to make predictions about potential reversals. 2. Moving Averages: Moving averages smooth out price data over a specific period, providing a clearer picture of the overall trend. The 50-day and 200-day moving averages are commonly used in Bitcoin analysis. Crossovers between different moving averages (e.g., golden cross or death cross) can indicate potential buying or selling opportunities. 3. Relative Strength Index (RSI): RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the speed and change of price movements. It ranges from 0 to 100 and can help identify overbought (above 70) or oversold (below 30) conditions. Traders often look for bullish or bearish divergence between RSI and price for potential trend reversals. 4. Volume Analysis: Volume can provide insights into the strength of price movements. By analyzing the relationship between price and volume, traders can assess whether a price move is supported by strong or weak participation. 5. Chart Patterns: Traders often rely on classic chart patterns, such as triangles, double tops, double bottoms, head and shoulders, and rectangles, to identify potential trend reversals or continuation patterns. It's important to note that technical analysis is subjective and should be used alongside other tools and fundamental analysis. Additionally, market psychology and external factors can heavily influence cryptocurrency prices, so it's crucial to stay informed about news, regulatory changes, and market sentiment. Remember, the cryptocurrency market can be highly unpredictable, and investing in Bitcoin or any other digital asset carries risks. Always do your own research and consider seeking professional advice before making any investment decisions."},{"prompt":"Will Dogecoin fall ?","completion":"As an AI language model, I cannot predict specific price movements or provide financial advice.

Давайте начнем с основных понятий и подхода к решению задачи Palindrome Number. В данной задаче, мы должны определить, является ли заданное число палиндромом. Палиндром - это число или текст, которые одинаково читаются в обоих направлениях (например, 121 или abba). Шаги решения задачи: 1. Проверка на отрицательное число и числа, заканчивающиеся на 0: - Такие числа не являются палиндромами, поэтому мы должны сразу же вернуть \`false\`. - В C++, это можно сделать с помощью конструкции \`if\`. 2. Переворачиваем число: - Мы должны получить обратную последовательность цифр заданного числа. - Для этого мы можем использовать цикл, который будет извлекать последнюю цифру числа, добавлять ее к переменной \`reversed\` (начальное значение которой равно 0), а затем удалять последнюю цифру из числа. - В языке C++, мы используем оператор \`%\` для извлечения последней цифры и оператор \`/\` для удаления последней цифры из числа. 3. Сравниваем перевернутое число с оригиналом: - Мы должны сравнить значение перевернутого числа и исходного числа. - Если они равны, значит, число является палиндромом, и мы возвращаем \`true\`. В противном случае, возвращаем \`false\`. Вот пример кода на C++, решающий эту задачу: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> bool isPalindrome(int x) { if (x < 0 || (x != 0 && x % 10 == 0)) { return false; } int reversed = 0; int original = x; while (x > 0) { reversed = reversed * 10 + x % 10; x /= 10; } return reversed == original; } int main() { int num; std::cout << \\"Введите число: \\"; std::cin >> num; if (isPalindrome(num)) { std::cout << \\"Число является палиндромом\\" << std::endl; } else { std::cout << \\"Число не является палиндромом\\" << std::endl; } return 0; } \`\`\` Когда вы запустите данный код, он попросит вас ввести число, которое должно быть проверено на палиндром. Затем программа вызывает функцию \`isPalindrome\` для проверки числа и выводит соответствующее сообщение на экран.

Esta corriente se caracteriza por intentar plasmar la realidad de manera objetiva y fiel, pero al mismo tiempo buscando trascender hacia una dimensión metafísica. Los escritores de este movimiento literario abordaban temas existenciales, filosóficos y religiosos, explorando la esencia de la vida, el sentido de la existencia humana y la relación entre Dios y el hombre. Uno de los máximos exponentes de este movimiento fue José Ortega y Gasset, cuya obra \\"La deshumanización del arte\\" se considera fundamental para comprender el realismo metafísico español. Otros escritores influyentes fueron Miguel de Unamuno, Ramón María del Valle-Inclán y Pío Baroja. A diferencia del realismo literario convencional, el realismo metafísico español se caracteriza por su carácter introspectivo, intelectual y especulativo. Los escritores buscan ir más allá de la superficie de las cosas para indagar en los misterios de la existencia y la espiritualidad.

In the pioneer phase, organisations often lack competition as the result of a technological innovation that brings a completely new product to the market. An excerpt from Eugene Schwartz’ book says that in level 1, organisations must “be simple,” and “be direct.” “Name either the need or the claim in your headline- nothing more. Dramatize the claim in your copy- make it as powerful as possible. And then bring in your product; and prove that it works.” Ideally, you’re attempting to tell as many people as possible about your new product, and how it solves problems in a completely unseen way, so you can capture as much as the market as possible before competitors – and potentially regulators – step into the equation. Example: Buy Now: The world’s first and only [insert product or service here] LEVEL TWO: OUT-DOING THE COMPETITION In the second level of market sophistication, we move past the concept of having a one-of-a-kind product or service and move into a more familiar arena of having a product or service with fierce competition. At this level, Schwartz says it’s imperative that organizations maintain the assertion that you’re above the competition and prove this to your potential customers with claims about your product or service that will outdo competitors. Schwartz writes that “if you’re second, and the direct claim is still working – then copy that successful claim – but enlarge on it. Drive it to the absolute limit.” Dan Lok writes that “at stage two, the descriptions of your product or service are longer, the market is more sophisticated, and you need to explain more than why you’re better than the competition.” You can see from these two quotes that as we move through the pillars, it’s increasingly important to assert dominance over your competitors, or “outbid” them with features and/or offerings that they’re not making to the market. Example: The [insert product/service here] that is twice as effective as the competition LEVEL THREE: SHOWING CUSTOMERS HOW IT WORKS In the third level of market sophistication, as you can probably guess, those in the market are increasingly aware of the claims made for your products and services, but they don’t yet understand exactly how the whole thing works. Appealing to the third level market with sales tactics from levels one and two simply won’t work, as they’ve heard it before, and they’re not going to be baited in the same way. Schwartz writes that “if your market is at the stage where they’ve heard all the claims, in all their extremes, then mere repetition or exaggeration won’t work any longer. What this market needs now is a new device to make all these claims become fresh and believable to making them again. In other ways, a new mechanism – a new way to make the old promise work. A different process – a fresh chance – a brand-new possibility of access where only disappointment has resulted before.” Essentially, the third level of market sophistication requires you to connect with buyers that are increasingly familiar with the market. This can be achieved not by explicitly selling your product but marketing the how of your product or service. Examples of this can be the time-saving measures of a piece of accounting software “saving businesses [x amount of time],” or a new washing machine that can reduce water use while maintaining a quality clean. LEVEL FOUR: THE COLD WAR The fourth level of market sophistication, according to Schwartz, is where competitors are locked in a fierce battle to capture the hearts and minds of the buying public; calling it in the ‘arms-race’ level. In this level, your competitors are firmly on your heels, and offering a product or service that levels the competition, and as a result, there are a lot more direct comparisons and battles for each purchase. Schwartz writes that “if a competitor has just introduced a new mechanism to achieve the same claim as that performed by your product, and that a new-mechanism announcement is producing sales, then counter in this way.” “Simply elaborate or enlarge upon the successful mechanism,” he writes. “Make it easier, quicker, surer; allow it to solve more of the problem; overcome old limitations; promise extra benefits. You are beginning a stage of embellishment similar to the Second Stage of Sophistication,” Schwartz says. As you can see, this stage requires you to put your product on a pedestal above the competition, but this comes with its own set of risks. You need to ensure that the claims you’re making to customers are in fact truthful, otherwise you risk abusing their trust, losing business and even facing penalties from regulators. Example: Our [insert product/service] is half the price of [insert competitor] and twice as effective; why settle for less? LEVEL FIVE: THE STORY-TELLING PHASE In the fifth and final level, customers out in the market are well aware of your product, your competitors, as well as the claims and tactics that you’ve employed so far; they simply won’t work for anyone at this level of market sophistication. Therefore, Schwartz says that it’s essential to understand that “the emphasis shifts from the promise and the mechanism which accomplishes it, to identification with the prospect [themselves].” “You are dealing here with the problem of bringing your prospect into your ad- not through desire, but through identification.” I’d like to believe that Schwartz is addressing Simon Sinek’s popular notion of understanding your organization’s why, and marketing this to your customers. It’s important to remember that at this stage, the buying public will no longer be persuaded by big claims and fancy writing, but they can potentially buy into your organization’s vision as a business. If your organization exists to improve the quality of life for someone with a disability, for example, this would be a much more powerful way of advertising your products to a sophisticated buyer, rather than simply presenting them with a product, claim and a price-tag. ]","completion":"Prompt 1: J'ai un (Produit) qui aide les gens à (Obtenir un Résultat).

Niveaux de sophistication du marché selon Eugene Schwartz: NIVEAU 1: LE NIVEAU PIONNIER Le premier niveau de sophistication du marché signifie simplement que votre produit ou service est complètement nouveau ou innovant, et que le marché n'a jamais entendu parler d'une offre similaire. À ce stade pionnier, les organisations manquent souvent de concurrence en raison d'une innovation technologique qui apporte un nouveau produit complètement différent sur le marché. Selon Eugene Schwartz, à ce niveau 1, les organisations doivent \\"être simples\\" et \\"être directes\\". Il est idéal de dire autant de personnes que possible au sujet de votre nouveau produit et de la manière dont il résout les problèmes d'une manière totalement inédite, afin de capturer autant de parts de marché que possible avant que les concurrents - et éventuellement les régulateurs - n'entrent en jeu. Exemple : Achetez maintenant : Le premier et unique [insérer le produit ou le service ici] au monde. NIVEAU DEUX: DÉPASSER LA CONCURRENCE Au deuxième niveau de sophistication du marché, nous dépassons le concept d'avoir un produit ou un service unique en son genre et entrons dans une arène plus familière où nous avons un produit ou un service avec une concurrence féroce. À ce niveau, Eugene Schwartz dit qu'il est impératif que les organisations maintiennent l'affirmation selon laquelle elles sont au-dessus de la concurrence et prouvent cela à leurs clients potentiels avec des arguments sur leur produit ou service qui surpasseront ceux de leurs concurrents. Eugene Schwartz écrit que \\"si vous êtes deuxième et que l'argument direct fonctionne toujours, alors copiez cet argument réussi, mais agrandissez-le. Poussez-le à la limite absolue\\". Vous pouvez voir à partir de ces citations que plus nous progressons dans les niveaux de sophistication, plus il est important d'affirmer la suprématie de votre produit sur la concurrence, ou de les \\"surenchérir\\" avec des caractéristiques ou des offres qu'ils ne proposent pas sur le marché. Exemple : Le [insérer le produit/le service ici] qui est deux fois plus efficace que la concurrence. NIVEAU TROIS: MONTRER AUX CLIENTS COMMENT ÇA FONCTIONNE Au troisième niveau de sophistication du marché, comme vous pouvez probablement le deviner, les personnes sur le marché sont de plus en plus conscientes des revendications faites pour vos produits et services, mais elles ne comprennent pas encore exactement comment tout cela fonctionne. Attirer un marché de ce niveau avec des tactiques de vente des niveaux un et deux ne fonctionnera pas, car ils ont déjà entendu cela et ils ne seront pas attirés de la même manière. Eugene Schwartz écrit que \\"si votre marché est à un stade où il a déjà entendu toutes les revendications, dans toutes leurs extrêmes, alors la simple répétition ou l'exagération ne fonctionnera plus. Ce dont ce marché a besoin maintenant, c'est d'un nouveau dispositif qui rendra toutes ces revendications fraîches et crédibles pour les refaire. En d'autres termes, un nouveau mécanisme - une nouvelle façon de faire fonctionner la vieille promesse. Un processus différent - une nouvelle chance - une toute nouvelle possibilité d'accès là où seule la déception a résulté auparavant\\". Essentiellement, le troisième niveau de sophistication du marché vous demande de vous connecter avec des acheteurs de plus en plus familiers avec le marché. Cela peut être réalisé non pas en vendant explicitement votre produit, mais en faisant la promotion de la manière dont votre produit ou service fonctionne. Exemples : Les mesures de gain de temps d'un logiciel de comptabilité \\"qui économise [une certaine quantité de temps] aux entreprises\\", ou une nouvelle machine à laver qui peut réduire la consommation d'eau tout en maintenant un nettoyage de qualité. NIVEAU QUATRE: LA GUERRE FROIDE Le quatrième niveau de sophistication du marché, selon Eugene Schwartz, est celui où les concurrents se livrent une bataille acharnée pour capturer les coeurs et les esprits du public acheteur. On l'appelle le niveau de la \\"course aux armements\\". À ce niveau, vos concurrents sont fermement sur vos talons et offrent un produit ou un service qui rivalise avec le vôtre, ce qui entraîne beaucoup plus de comparaisons directes et de luttes pour chaque achat. Eugene Schwartz écrit que \\"si un concurrent vient d'introduire un nouveau mécanisme pour atteindre la même revendication que celle effectuée par votre produit, et que cette annonce de nouveau mécanisme produit des ventes, contre-attaquez de cette manière\\". \\"Il suffit d'élaborer ou d'agrandir le mécanisme réussi\\", écrit-il. \\"Rendez-le plus facile, plus rapide, plus sûr, permettez-lui de résoudre plus de problèmes, de surmonter d'anciennes limites ; promettez des avantages supplémentaires. Vous commencez une étape d'embellissement similaire à la deuxième étape de sophistication\\", dit Eugene Schwartz. Comme vous pouvez le voir, cette étape vous oblige à mettre votre produit sur un piédestal au-dessus de la concurrence, mais cela comporte aussi ses propres risques. Vous devez vous assurer que les revendications que vous faites aux clients sont véridiques, sinon vous risquez d'abuser de leur confiance, de perdre des affaires et même de faire face à des sanctions de la part des régulateurs. Exemple : Notre [insérer produit/service] est deux fois moins cher que [insérer concurrent] et deux fois plus efficace ; pourquoi se contenter de moins ? NIVEAU CINQ: LA PHASE DU RÉCIT Au cinquième et dernier niveau, les clients sur le marché sont bien conscients de votre produit, de vos concurrents, ainsi que des revendications et des tactiques que vous avez utilisées jusqu'à présent ; elles ne fonctionneront simplement pour personne à ce niveau de sophistication du marché. Par conséquent, Eugene Schwartz dit qu'il est essentiel de comprendre que \\"l'accent passe de la promesse et du mécanisme qui l'accomplit à l'identification avec le prospect [lui-même]\\". \\"Vous devez ici faire en sorte que votre prospect entre dans votre publicité - non par le désir, mais par l'identification.\\" J'aimerais croireque Eugene Schwartz aborde la célèbre notion de Simon Sinek concernant la compréhension"},{"prompt":"{CENTRAL CITY, LAQUA - FELSHIA CONTINENT} Mary: (thinking to myself) \\"What was that sound?\\"","completion":"Mary looked around, trying to locate the source of the sound. It appeared to be coming from an alley nearby. Curiosity piqued, she followed the sound, cautiously making her way through the dimly lit alley. As she rounded a corner, Mary's eyes widened at the sight before her. A small group of people were huddled together, holding a makeshift campfire amidst the urban backdrop. They looked weary and worn, their ragged clothes revealing their nomadic lifestyle. Mary could sense their desperation and hardship. Among the group, she noticed a young girl, no older than six or seven, sitting alone by the fire with a tattered teddy bear clutched in her arms. Her vacant stare tugged at Mary's heartstrings, filling her with a mixture of sadness and empathy. Mary approached the group cautiously, not wanting to startle them. She greeted them with a warm smile and offered food and water that she had brought along. The gesture was met with gratitude, and slowly the group began to open up, sharing their stories of loss and struggle. Mary learned about their displacement caused by an ongoing conflict in a neighboring kingdom. They had fled their homes, seeking refuge in Central City, the capital of Laqua. With limited resources and no place to call home, they resorted to living in the shadows, seeking solace wherever they could find it. Moved by their plight, Mary knew she couldn't simply walk away. Deep inside, she felt a calling to make a difference, to help these people find stability and hope once again. She decided to reach out to local organizations and charities, hoping to rally support for the refugees. Days turned into weeks, and eventually, Mary managed to gather enough resources to provide temporary shelter, food, and clothing for the displaced group. Through her efforts, she also established connections with people who shared her passion for helping those in need. With their combined efforts, a makeshift shelter was transformed into a community center. It became a sanctuary for the refugees, offering them a safe space to heal, receive education, and find opportunities for employment. Mary's dream of bringing stability and hope to the homeless in Central City became a reality. As the days passed, Mary watched the young girl, the one who had caught her attention initially, blossom with newfound happiness. The teddy bear, once the only comfort she had, was now joined by new friends and smiles that hadn't been seen in a long time. Mary's heart swelled with joy as she saw the impact her actions had made. The sound that had initially led her here became a reminder of the resilience of the human spirit and the power of compassion. In the heart of Central City, a new beacon of hope emerged, lighting the way for a brighter future for all."},{"prompt":"Informe economico","completion":"Un informe económico es un documento que recopila y analiza información sobre diferentes aspectos de la economía.

Give some preventive actions we can take to sustain the area","completion":"To prevent erosion and sedimentation in the factory area, here are some preventive actions that you can take: 1. Implement proper drainage systems: Install efficient and well-maintained drainage systems across the factory area to collect and channel stormwater away from vulnerable areas. This will help prevent erosion caused by excessive water runoff. 2. Create vegetative buffer zones: Establish vegetative barrier zones around the perimeter of the factory area, especially near water bodies or slopes. Planting grasses, trees, and shrubs in these areas can help absorb and retain water, reducing erosion and sedimentation. 3. Install sediment control measures: Implement sediment control practices, such as sediment fences, silt barriers, sediment ponds, or sediment traps. These measures can intercept and capture sediment-laden water, preventing it from reaching sensitive areas. 4. Regularly inspect and maintain stormwater management practices: Conduct routine inspections and maintenance of stormwater management systems to ensure their proper functioning. Clean out any accumulated sediment or debris to prevent blockages, which could lead to increased erosion and sedimentation. 5. Minimize disturbed areas: Avoid unnecessary land disturbance within the factory area and limit excavation or grading activities to the essential minimum. Reducing the amount of exposed soil will decrease the potential for erosion and sedimentation. 6. Stabilize exposed soil: Apply erosion control measures on bare soil surfaces, such as mulching, hydroseeding, or establishing temporary or permanent vegetation cover. These methods help stabilize the soil, prevent erosion, and promote sustainable plant growth. 7. Promote best practices for waste management: Ensure proper disposal of waste materials, such as chemicals, oils, and lubricants, to prevent contamination and potential erosion caused by spills. Implement an effective waste management plan that adheres to environmental regulations. 8. Educate employees and stakeholders: Conduct training sessions to educate employees and stakeholders about the importance of erosion prevention and sediment control. Encourage them to adopt responsible practices, report any issues, and actively participate in maintaining a sustainable factory area. 9. Monitor and address erosion-prone areas: Regularly monitor and assess areas susceptible to erosion. Identify and address erosion-prone spots promptly, implementing appropriate measures to prevent further erosion and reduce sedimentation risks. 10. Comply with regulations and environmental permits: Ensure compliance with local regulations and obtain necessary environmental permits for erosion and sediment control measures. Adhering to legal requirements will not only protect the environment but also help sustain the factory area. By implementing these preventive actions, you can significantly reduce erosion and sedimentation of the factory area, promoting sustainability and protecting the surrounding environment."},{"prompt":"Please give above as a real world example with date","completion":"[Your Company Name] [Date] PREVENTION OF EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION OF FACTORY AREA In order to sustain the factory area and prevent erosion and sedimentation, [Your Company Name] has implemented the following preventive actions: 1.

En Node.js, les streams sont une des fonctionnalités principales qui permettent de manipuler les données, particulièrement lorsque vous traitez des données volumineuses ou lorsque vous souhaitez effectuer des opérations en temps réel. Un stream est une séquence de données que vous pouvez lire depuis ou écrire vers. Ils sont basés sur l'idée d'un flux continu de données, en opposition à un traitement d'ensemble. Il existe quatre types de streams en Node.js : 1. Readable streams : Ils sont utilisés pour lire des données de différentes sources, comme des fichiers, des flux réseau ou d'autres sources de données. Vous pouvez consommer les données de manière asynchrone en utilisant des fonctions telles que \`stream.on('data', callback)\` ou de manière synchrone en appelant \`stream.read()\`. 2. Writable streams : Ils sont utilisés pour écrire des données vers une destination, comme un fichier ou un flux réseau. Vous pouvez écrire des données de manière asynchrone en utilisant des fonctions telles que \`stream.write(data, callback)\` ou de manière synchrone en appelant \`stream.write(data)\`. 3. Duplex streams : Ils peuvent à la fois lire et écrire des données. Ils combinent les fonctionnalités des streams lisibles et des streams inscriptibles. 4. Transform streams : Ils sont similaires aux duplex streams, mais avec une fonctionnalité supplémentaire de transformation des données lors qu'elles sont lues ou écrites. Ils sont souvent utilisés pour modifier ou manipuler les données pendant leur transit. Les streams offrent plusieurs avantages, notamment une faible consommation de mémoire car les données sont traitées par morceaux plutôt qu'en une seule fois, une meilleure gestion de la mémoire tampon pour les opérations asynchrones, des performances améliorées grâce à la lecture et à l'écriture par morceaux, une compatibilité avec les opérations en temps réel, tels que le streaming vidéo ou audio, et une possibilité de chaîner et de modifier les flux de manière plus flexible. En résumé, les streams en Node.js sont un puissant mécanisme de manipulation des données, permettant de lire, d'écrire et de transformer les données de manière asynchrone ou synchrone, ce qui les rend extrêmement utiles pour gérer des opérations volumineuses ou en temps réel."},{"prompt":"Donc il ne travaille pas seulement pour des fichiers n’est-ce pas ?","completion":"Exactement, les streams ne se limitent pas aux fichiers. Ils sont polyvalents et peuvent être utilisés pour lire ou écrire des données à partir de diverses sources ou vers diverses destinations. Voici quelques exemples de sources et de destinations de données couramment utilisées avec les streams en dehors des fichiers : 1. Flux réseau : Vous pouvez utiliser des streams pour lire ou écrire des données à partir d'une connexion réseau, comme des requêtes HTTP ou des sockets. 2. Flux de données HTTP : Les modules comme \`http.request\` ou \`https.request\` renvoient un objet de flux que vous pouvez utiliser pour récupérer les données d'une réponse ou envoyer des données dans le corps de la requête. 3. Flux de données de la console : Vous pouvez lire ou écrire des données à partir de la console en utilisant les streams \`process.stdin\` et \`process.stdout\`. 4. Flux de données compressées : Vous pouvez utiliser des streams pour compresser ou décompresser des données, par exemple en utilisant les modules \`zlib\` ou \`gzip\`. 5. Flux de données de la base de données : Les bibliothèques de bases de données telles que MySQL, MongoDB ou PostgreSQL peuvent renvoyer des objets de flux pour lire les résultats de requêtes ou écrire des données dans une base de données. 6. Flux de données en temps réel : Les streams sont souvent utilisés pour transmettre des données en temps réel, que ce soit pour le streaming de vidéos, d'audio, de messages ou même de mises à jour en direct. En résumé, les streams ne se limitent pas aux fichiers et peuvent être utilisés pour la lecture ou l'écriture de données à partir de diverses sources et destinations. Ils sont flexibles et polyvalents, ce qui leur permet d'être utilisés dans de nombreux scénarios différents."},{"prompt":"Chunk tu peux m’expliquer ça ?","completion":"Bien sûr ! En utilisant les streams, les données sont traitées par morceaux appelés \\"chunks\\". Un chunk est une petite partie des données qui est lue ou écrite en même temps. Lorsqu'un flux est en lecture (readable stream), il génère des chunks de données à mesure que les données sont lues depuis la source. Contrairement à la lecture d'une grande quantité de données en une fois, les chunks permettent de traiter les données par petits morceaux, ce qui facilite la gestion des données volumineuses ou des opérations en temps réel. Lorsqu'un flux est en écriture (writable stream), vous pouvez envoyer des données sous forme de chunks, soit de manière asynchrone en utilisant des fonctions telles que \`stream.write(chunk, callback)\`, soit de manière synchrone en appelant \`stream.write(chunk)\`. Les chunks sont généralement de taille fixe, mais cela peut varier en fonction du type de stream et de la configuration spécifique. Dans la plupart des cas, vous ne pouvez pas définir directement la taille des chunks, car cela dépend de la mise en œuvre du stream en question. La gestion des chunks est bénéfique pour plusieurs raisons : 1. Gestion efficace de la mémoire : Traiter les données par morceaux permet d'économiser de la mémoire, car vous n'avez pas besoin de stocker l'ensemble des données en mémoire avant de les traiter. 2. Performance optimisée : Les streams permettent de commencer à traiter les données dès que les premiers chunks sont disponibles, sans attendre la fin du flux complet. 3. Traitement en temps réel : Les chunks permettent de traiter les données en temps réel, tels que le streaming vidéo ou audio, où les données sont envoyées et traitées en continu sans attendre l'ensemble des données. En résumé, les chunks sont des morceaux de données utilisés dans les streams pour représenter des portions de données lues ou écrites à partir d'une source. Ils permettent une gestion efficace de la mémoire, améliorent les performances et facilitent le traitement en temps réel des données."},{"prompt":"{CENTRAL CITY, LAQUA - FELSHIA CONTINENT} Mary: (thinking to myself) \\"What was that sound?\\" (I look to see what could have caused that noise.

Когда пользователь вносит изменения, JS должен отправить запрос на бэкенд, передавая данные об изменениях. Бэкенд должен принимать этот запрос, обрабатывать данные и выполнять соответствующие операции в базе данных. Вот примерный алгоритм действий: 1. Фронтенд (JS) обрабатывает изменения в таблице и формирует JSON-объект с измененными данными. 2. Фронтенд отправляет POST запрос на определенный URL бэкенда, передавая JSON-объект с измененными данными. 3. Бэкенд (Python) принимает POST запрос, получает JSON-объект с изменениями. 4. Бэкенд обрабатывает данные, выполняет нужные операции в базе данных с использованием библиотеки для работы с SQL (например, psycopg2 для PostgreSQL или pymysql для MySQL). 5. Бэкенд возвращает результат обработки запроса фронтенду (например, статус операции или обновленные данные). 6. Фронтенд может отобразить результат обработки или выполнить другие действия в зависимости от возвращенного результата. Обратите внимание, что безопасность и валидация данных также являются важными аспектами разработки данной функциональности. Рекомендуется проверять и очищать данные, полученные от фронтенда, чтобы избежать возможности SQL инъекций или ошибок обработки данных."},{"prompt":"нужен пример кода","completion":"Конечный пример кода может зависеть от фреймворков, библиотек и используемых технологий в вашем проекте.

Après avoir donné naissance à cet univers, le Créateur décida de le peupler de diverses créatures, chacune ayant un rôle précis à jouer. Les demi-dieux, descendants des premières divinités, furent chargés de veiller sur le bon fonctionnement de l'univers. Chacun avait un domaine de responsabilité spécifique, qu'il devait protéger et préserver. C'est ainsi que l'un des demi-dieux fut assigné à la surveillance de la baleine monde. Son rôle était de s'assurer que la baleine ne s'échappe pas de sa dimension et ne cause pas de destruction. Au fil des siècles, le monde continua de prospérer grâce à l'harmonie créée par les divinités. Cependant, une menace ancienne commença à émerger des profondeurs de l'univers.

Au fil du temps, le gardien devint connu sous le nom de Gardien des Profondeurs. Sa tâche était lourde, mais il savait que c'était sa destinée de protéger le monde des ravages de la baleine monde. Des siècles passèrent et le Gardien des Profondeurs était immuable dans son rôle. Il avait appris à canaliser son énergie divin en créant un bouclier puissant qui entourait la dimension où la baleine était emprisonnée. Ainsi, il empêchait chaque goutte d'eau de s'échapper, maintenant la baleine sous contrôle et préservant la tranquillité du monde. Malgré sa solitude, le Gardien des Profondeurs trouva une forme de réconfort dans son devoir sacré. Il se liait d'amitié avec les créatures marines qui peuplaient les environs et ressentait la gratitude des plantes et des animaux terrestres pour sa protection. Il savait que son sacrifice était essentiel pour maintenir l'équilibre des forces naturelles. Un jour, alors que le Gardien des Profondeurs patrouillait les confins de la dimension, il aperçut une étincelle de lumière au loin. Intrigué, il se rapprocha pour découvrir qu'une jeune femme étrange se tenait à l'endroit où la lumière émanait. Elle était différente de tout ce qu'il avait jamais vu, avec des cheveux d'argent et des yeux perçants. « Gardien des Profondeurs », dit-elle d'une voix calme mais puissante. « Je suis Astria, la messagère des dieux. Je suis venue vous offrir une proposition qui pourrait mettre fin à votre éternelle garde. » Le Gardien des Profondeurs écarquilla les yeux, stupéfait. Jamais il n'aurait imaginé qu'une telle opportunité se présenterait. Il se demanda pourquoi les dieux l'avaient choisi pour cette proposition, mais il savait qu'il ne pouvait pas la laisser passer. « Parlez, Astria », répondit-il avec une voix grave. « Je suis prêt à entendre votre proposition. » Astria expliqua que les dieux avaient pris conscience des efforts sans fin du Gardien des Profondeurs pour protéger le monde. Ils avaient également senti la détresse de la baleine monde, emprisonnée et cherchant désespérément à retrouver sa liberté. Les dieux avaient décidé qu'il était temps de trouver un arrangement qui permettrait de restaurer l'équilibre sans sacrifier la baleine. « Nous vous proposons un choix, Gardien des Profondeurs », déclara Astria. « Vous pourriez être libéré de votre devoir et offrir à la baleine un moyen de s'exprimer sans causer de dévastation. En échange, vous devrez trouver un autre gardien fiable pour prendre votre place et garantir que la baleine n'abusé jamais de cette nouvelle liberté. » Le Gardien des Profondeurs réfléchit profondément. Il savait que cette décision était d'une importance capitale pour l'avenir du monde. Mais il voyait aussi dans cette proposition une chance de trouver une nouvelle voie, peut-être même une destinée plus épanouissante. Après avoir pris le temps de peser les avantages et les conséquences, le Gardien des Profondeurs prit enfin sa décision. Il fixa Astria du regard et dit : « Je suis prêt à accepter votre proposition. Mais je vous demande une faveur en retour. Trouvez-moi un digne successeur, quelqu'un qui non seulement saura garder la baleine monde sous contrôle, mais qui comprendra également la valeur de la nature et de l'équilibre. » Astria sourit, comprenant la sagesse de cette demande. Elle accepta et promit de trouver le gardien idéal pour prendre la relève du Gardien des Profondeurs. Ainsi, le destin du Gardien des Profondeurs et celui de la baleine monde étaient liés, et une nouvelle ère de paix et d'harmonie commençait à prendre forme.

Je vais maintenant imaginer le lore de ce monde en m'inspirant du lore de la série Wakfu et en gardant à l'esprit que l'histoire de la baleine monde que vous avez mentionnée n'est pas l'élément central. Dans un temps lointain, au cœur de l'univers, les dieux se sont assemblés pour créer un nouveau monde, rempli de mystères et de magie. Ils ont insufflé l'essence de leur puissance dans la toile de la réalité et ont donné naissance à des êtres vivants dotés de pouvoirs extraordinaires. Parmi ces créatures se trouvaient les demi-dieux, des êtres semi-divins héritant de la puissance de leurs parents divins. Chaque demi-dieu avait un rôle unique à jouer dans l'équilibre du monde. Certains étaient responsables de la protection des forêts et de la vie végétale, tandis que d'autres surveillaient les océans et régulaient les flux marins. Dans ce monde, les créatures magiques vivaient librement, apportant tantôt prospérité, tantôt chaos. Les mortels, quant à eux, étaient plongés dans un constant éveil de leur propre potentiel magique, cherchant à maîtriser les éléments et à se connecter avec les forces mystiques qui régnaient autour d'eux. Cependant, avec le temps, de sombres forces émergèrent dans les recoins les plus reculés du monde. Un culte dévoyé, appelé les Disciples du Néant, cherchait à exploiter et à détruire la magie qui maintenait l'équilibre du monde. Leur chef, un sorcier puissant et avide de pouvoir, tentait de s'emparer de l'essence divine des demi-dieux afin de devenir le maître absolu de la réalité. Les demi-dieux, conscients de cette menace grandissante, formèrent une alliance pour contrer les Disciples du Néant. Ils se regroupèrent et consolidèrent leur puissance pour protéger le monde de la destruction imminente. Cependant, même avec leur force combinée, ils furent confrontés à un ennemi redoutable. Pour préserver l'équilibre, les demi-dieux décidèrent de sceller le pouvoir des Disciples du Néant dans un artefact antique appelé la Pierre d'Éternité. Cette pierre renfermait l'essence du Néant, où tout chaos et toute obscurité étaient condensés. Les demi-dieux parvinrent à piéger les disciples à l'intérieur de la pierre, scellant ainsi leur pouvoir corrompu. Cependant, lors du rituel de scellement, la Pierre d'Éternité émit une énergie dévastatrice qui se répandit à travers le monde. Cela eut pour conséquence de déstabiliser les différents éléments naturels. Les océans se soulevèrent, les montagnes se formèrent et les cieux s'embrasèrent. Au milieu de ce chaos, la baleine monde, une créature céleste dotée d'un pouvoir sans limite, émergea des profondeurs de l'espace pour apaiser les éléments déchaînés. Depuis ce jour, la baleine monde vole dans les cieux en utilisant son chant apaisant pour calmer les tempêtes et ramener l'harmonie dans le monde. Elle est devenue un symbole d'espoir et de protection pour les habitants de ce monde. Les demi-dieux, quant à eux, ont consolidé leur rôle de gardiens des éléments, veillant à ce que l'équilibre soit maintenu. Ils forment une société secrète connue sous le nom des Veilleurs, dont le but est de prévenir toute menace potentielle et de protéger les mortels contre les forces néfastes. Ainsi, dans ce monde fantastique, les mortels coexistent avec les demi-dieux, les créatures magiques et la baleine monde, chacun jouant un rôle crucial dans la préservation de l'équilibre et de la magie qui imprègne chaque parcelle de cette réalité.

Ainsi, il déploie toute sa force et sa détermination pour empêcher la baleine de s'échapper. Pendant des siècles, Aélios surveille attentivement la baleine. Il se nourrit de l'énergie qui émane de la dimension coupée du monde pour se renforcer et rester en état de vigilance permanente. Il observe les mouvements et les pleurs de la baleine, s'assurant qu'elle reste calme et enchaînée. Au fil du temps, Aélios commence à développer une profonde empathie envers la baleine. Il comprend qu'elle ne souhaitait pas causer de mal, mais qu'elle était simplement victime de sa propre nature. Les larmes incessantes de la baleine étaient le résultat de sa tristesse et de sa souffrance d'être coupée du monde extérieur.

Son devoir envers la terre est remis en question par son empathie grandissante envers la baleine. Armé de sa sagesse et guidé par son intuition, Aélios décide de chercher une solution qui concilie à la fois la protection de la terre et le bien-être de la baleine. Il se lance alors dans une quête pour trouver le juste équilibre entre ces deux responsabilités.

Il avait pour mission de surveiller chaque mouvement de la créature gigantesque et de s'assurer qu'elle ne causerait plus de dévastation. Le gardien, nommé Azriel, avait hérité des pouvoirs de sa lignée de demi-dieux, ce qui lui permettait d'être à la fois puissant et sensible aux émotions de Bahira. Il savait que la baleine avait pleuré à cause d'une profonde souffrance, d'un chagrin qu'elle ne pouvait exprimer autrement. Il ressentait sa tristesse et espérait secrètement que, d'une manière ou d'une autre, il pourrait soulager sa détresse. Au fil du temps, une amitié étrange se développa entre Azriel et Bahira. Bien qu'ils appartenaient à des mondes différents, ils trouvèrent du réconfort dans leur présence mutuelle. Azriel racontait des histoires à la baleine et jouait même de la musique apaisante pour elle, espérant ainsi, en quelque sorte, réconforter son cœur blessé. Mais malgré toute l'affection qu'Azriel ressentait pour Bahira, il savait qu'il devait rester vigilant. Il ne pouvait pas laisser sa tristesse prendre le dessus et risquer de libérer la baleine monde sur la terre à nouveau. Il se rappelait la souffrance que sa colère et ses larmes infinies avaient infligée autrefois au monde, et il savait que cela ne devait jamais se reproduire. Jour après jour, Azriel observait Bahira nager dans les profondeurs de sa dimension prisonnière. Il voyait l'immensité de sa splendeur, mais il savait aussi que c'était une beauté dangereuse. Il se rappelait les ravages causés par les eaux déchaînées et les terres dévastées lors de la fuite de Bahira. Sa responsabilité de gardien n'était pas une tâche légère, mais il était prêt à tout sacrifier pour protéger le monde. Alors qu'il restait vigilant, Azriel ne pouvait s'empêcher de se demander si un jour Bahira serait libre de nouveau. Il rêvait d'une époque où le monde serait guéri de ses blessures, où Bahira pourrait retrouver sa place en tant que gardienne bienveillante des éléments. Mais pour l'instant, la baleine monde restait dans sa dimension isolée, et Azriel restait son gardien dévoué, prêt à tout pour maintenir l'équilibre et la paix dans le monde."},{"prompt":"Hanuman photo","completion":"I apologize, but as a text-based AI model, I am not able to display or share images.

Установите зависимости Sentry для Spring Boot, добавив в файл \`pom.xml\` следующий код: \`\`\`xml <dependency> <groupId>io.sentry</groupId> <artifactId>sentry-spring-boot-starter</artifactId> <version>5.1.0</version> </dependency> \`\`\` 2. Создайте файл \`sentry.properties\` в папке ресурсов вашего проекта. В этом файле вы можете настроить различные параметры для Sentry, включая DSN (Data Source Name) и другие опции. Вот пример базовой конфигурации: \`\`\` sentry.dsn=<your-dsn> sentry.traces-sample-rate=1.0 \`\`\` 3. В вашем классе приложения (например, главном классе, расширяющем \`SpringBootServletInitializer\`), добавьте аннотацию \`@EnableSentry\` для включения мониторинга: \`\`\`java import io.sentry.spring.EnableSentry; import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication; import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication; @EnableSentry @SpringBootApplication public class YourApplication extends SpringBootServletInitializer { public static void main(String[] args) { SpringApplication.run(YourApplication.class, args); } } \`\`\` 4.

Au commencement, il y avait les dieux primordiaux qui façonnèrent l'univers et créèrent les premières formes de vie. Parmi eux se trouvaient la déesse des débuts, qui apportait l'harmonie et l'équilibre à toutes choses. Au fil du temps, de nombreux enfants divins naquirent de cette déesse, chacun ayant sa propre tâche et responsabilité dans le maintien de l'équilibre du monde. Il y avait la baleine monde, qui était chargée de provoquer les pluies nécessaires à la croissance des plantes et à la fertilité de la terre. Cependant, un jour, sans raison apparente, la baleine monde se mit à pleurer abondamment, inondant la terre et menaçant de causer d'immenses catastrophes. Un groupe de demi-dieux, conscients des dégâts potentiels, se rassembla pour trouver une solution. Après de longues réflexions et de nombreux essais infructueux, ils décidèrent de bâtir une dimension coupée du monde pour y isoler la baleine monde. Cette dimension devint une sorte de prison, empêchant la baleine d'interagir avec le monde extérieur et renfermant ainsi sa puissance destructrice. Parmi les demi-dieux qui participèrent à cette tâche, l'un d'entre eux décida de rester dans cette dimension en tant que gardien. Sa mission consistait à veiller sur la baleine monde, s'assurer qu'elle ne pourrait jamais s'échapper et causer des ravages sur le monde.

Au fil des siècles, le Gardien veille sans relâche, surveillant la baleine monde et protégeant le monde extérieur des conséquences potentiellement désastreuses de sa libération. La dimension coupée du monde est devenue un lieu mystérieux et dangereux, connu de peu, mais considéré comme un lieu de grande importance et de pouvoir. La baleine monde elle-même est devenue une figure légendaire, dont les pleurs abondants ont été interprétés par certaines cultures comme un présage de prospérité ou de malheur. Certains la vénèrent comme une entité divine, tandis que d'autres la craignent pour sa puissance potentielle. Mais au-delà de la baleine monde et de sa prison, l'univers est rempli de royaumes fantastiques, de créatures magiques et de peuples aux pouvoirs extraordinaires. Chaque créature, chaque lieu et chaque événement a son propre rôle à jouer dans l'histoire de ce monde riche en mystères et en aventures. En t'inspirant du lore de la série Wakfu, tu pourrais développer des civilisations anciennes vivant aux côtés des dieux, des conflits entre différentes races, des artefacts magiques recherchés par des héros, des prophéties mystérieuses qui guident les actions de certains personnages, et bien d'autres éléments qui contribueront à créer un univers fascinant et captivant."},{"prompt":"Elles modelèrent les éléments fondamentaux tels que la terre, l’eau, le feu et l’air, qui devinrent les piliers de la vie.

Le Gardien de l'Eau, une créature aquatique gracieuse et fluide, résidait dans les océans, les rivières et les lacs. Il était responsable de maintenir l'équilibre de l'eau, assurant ainsi la vie des créatures marines et des écosystèmes aquatiques. Quant au Gardien du Feu, une entité flamboyante et féroce, il demeurait au cœur des volcans et des sources de chaleur. Son rôle était de maintenir l'équilibre des forces du feu, fournissant chaleur et énergie aux êtres vivants, mais aussi veillant à ce que cet élément ne devienne pas destructeur. Enfin, le Gardien de l'Air, un être aérien aux ailes délicates, gouvernait les vents et les courants d'air. Il favorisait la circulation de l'air nécessaire aux êtres vivants, mais il était également responsable de créer des tempêtes et des vents violents lorsque cela était nécessaire pour nettoyer ou renouveler les énergies de l'atmosphère. Ces Gardiens Primordiaux, en coopération avec la baleine monde, maintenaient un équilibre délicat dans le monde, permettant aux différentes formes de vie de prospérer harmonieusement.

How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"WRITE 400 WORDS EASSY ON AI","completion":"Artificial intelligence, commonly known as AI, is revolutionizing various industries and rapidly transforming the way we live and work. AI refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think and learn like humans. It involves the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as speech recognition, problem-solving, learning, and decision-making. One of the significant impacts of AI can be witnessed in healthcare. AI-powered machines can now analyze vast amounts of medical data in a fraction of the time, assisting doctors in diagnosing diseases and tailoring treatment plans. These systems have the potential to save countless lives by detecting early signs of illnesses and recommending the most suitable treatments. Additionally, AI has also played a crucial role in streamlining administrative tasks in hospitals, reducing paperwork, and improving the overall efficiency of healthcare systems. Another area that AI has transformed is the transportation industry. Self-driving cars, powered by artificial intelligence, are being developed by leading companies worldwide. These cars can make decisions based on real-time data, reducing human error and the likelihood of accidents. Additionally, AI is also being utilized in optimizing traffic flow, predicting travel times, and adjusting navigation routes in response to changing conditions, thereby improving overall road safety and reducing traffic congestion. AI has also revolutionized the field of customer service. Chatbots, powered by AI algorithms, are now being used by many companies to provide instant customer support round the clock. These chatbots can respond to customer queries, provide product recommendations, and process basic transactions, all without the need for human intervention. This not only saves companies valuable manpower but also provides customers with quick and efficient solutions to their problems. Moreover, AI has significantly impacted the entertainment industry. Recommendation systems, used by streaming services such as Netflix and Spotify, analyze user preferences and behavior to suggest personalized content. This enhances the user experience and ensures that consumers are presented with options that align with their interests. Additionally, AI has also transformed the gaming industry by creating more immersive virtual environments and intelligent opponents that can learn and adapt to player strategies. However, the rise of AI also raises concerns about job displacement. As machines become more capable of performing tasks that were traditionally done by humans, there is a fear that many jobs will become obsolete. While it is true that AI will automate certain tasks, it will also create new jobs and opportunities in fields such as AI programming, data analysis, and system maintenance. The key lies in developing a workforce that is adaptable and equipped with the skills needed for the AI-driven economy. In conclusion, AI is already making significant strides in various industries, transforming the world as we know it. Its potential to improve healthcare, transportation, customer service, and entertainment is immense. However, it is essential to ensure that the benefits of AI are balanced with a thoughtful consideration of its ethical implications and the impact it has on the workforce. As we continue to advance AI technology, it is crucial to focus on creating a future where humans and machines can coexist and thrive together."},{"prompt":"你好","completion":"你好！有什么我可以帮助你的吗？"},{"prompt":"в версии 6.25.0 не находит import io.sentry.spring.SentryRequestFilter; import io.sentry.spring.SentryServletContextInitializer;","completion":"Если в версии 6.25.0 библиотеки Sentry не находятся классы \`io.sentry.spring.SentryRequestFilter\` и \`io.sentry.spring.SentryServletContextInitializer\`, возможно, эти классы были перемещены или переименованы в более новых версиях.

Desktop processors - AMD vs Intel: Which is better for AI and deep learning? The world of tech has always run rife with direct competition. Whether it’s Apple vs. Microsoft, Betamax vs. VHS, Nintendo vs. Sega or Google vs. Yahoo, wherever there is innovation there are always heads butting. Indeed, it could be argued that it’s this competition that catalyses innovation and cultivates real lasting progress. In the case of processors, the duelling sector leaders have always been Intel and AMD and it’s a rivalry with some serious history; a history that’s still being written. But whilst there has been plenty of discussion on the benefits and drawbacks of each manufacturer’s processors and chipsets in terms of gaming performance, there has been precious little discussion on how they both fare in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning (DL) applications. Of course, there are a wealth of differences and similarities to pick through, some abundantly obvious and some a little less so. To gain some wider perspective, we’ll be focusing on the fundamentals in an effort to provide a balanced argument and a helpful guide for those still on the fence about which team to throw down their chips on. ​​​ AMD vs. Intel - Which CPU is best suited to AI and deep learning?​ Click and drag to move ​ AMD vs Intel: Price Saving costs is always a major concern, particularly for R&D departments that might be putting together multiple rigs on a svelte budget. That’s why AMD has become so popular with everyone, from gamers to researchers, in recent years. Traditionally, AMD has always been seen as the underdog in this story and, as is often the case with underdogs, their products have generally been priced more affordably. This has led to some corners of the market to believe that Intel chips are better simply because they’re more expensive, which is certainly not the case. At least, not anymore. Whilst AMD processors might have initially been priced to match their lower performance when compared to Intel, in recent years, AMD has caught up with (and some might argue overtaken) their closest competitor in the value-for-money stakes as far as performance is concerned. Currently, however, when examining the price and performance of high-end CPUs, AMD Threadripper-based chips offer the greatest bang for your buck, at least in terms of sheer power. AMD vs Intel: Performance Deep learning workstations require bandwidth, and lots of it, so one of the primary concerns when choosing your CPU is the number of PCIe lanes that are on offer. The PCIe lanes on your CPU are primarily assigned to your graphics card (GPU), and each of your graphics cards will require 16 PCIe lanes otherwise known as 16x, to run at 'full-speed'. GPUs still do the majority of the heavy lifting within AI/DL workloads, so Deep learning workstations generally require a CPU with at least 40 PCIe lanes, as this will give more than enough bandwidth to run at least 2 GPUs simultaneously. 'Consumer-grade' CPUs, such as Intel's core range, or AMD's Ryzen chips will only offer you 16 PCIe lanes, so you really need to look at Intel's XEON lineup, which offers 40-64 lanes or if 64 lanes isn’t enough for you, then AMD's Threadripper or EPYC range, which provide up to 88 and 128 PCIe 4.0 lanes respectively (double the bandwidth of PCIe 3.0). AMD vs Intel: Specs The number of cores in the processor is an incredibly important consideration, particularly given the fact that AI and DL are incredibly complicated and power-hungry workloads that require enough cores to pre-process datasets and run multiple applications and containers simultaneously. AMD’s Threadripper packs up to a whopping 64 cores and 128 threads, which is beyond anything offered by Intel outside of the server space - it’s obvious why so many serious R&D divisions are turning to AMD over the more established ‘tentpole’ brand. AMD’s prevalence in this sector has just been confirmed by NVIDIA, who recently chose AMD (its own major rival in the gaming performance sector) over Intel to provide the processors for its new DGX A100 deep learning system; specifically its EPYC server processors. Intel’s competitor (the Xeon) includes a much-heralded DL Boost feature, which drastically speeds up DL interferencing operations. But in terms of sheer power, AMD’s EPYC has them beat hands down. Memory channels and disk I/O bandwidth are also considerations here – particularly the former, as RAM remains the cheapest way of maximising your processor's potential. AMD vs Intel: Recent releases Of course, the relatively recent introduction of Intel’s new “Cooper Lake” 3rd Gen Intel Xeon Scalable processors has certainly set the cat amongst the pigeons. These Intel CPUs have been designed from the ground up for AI and analytics workloads running in data centres, network and intelligent-edge environments. The company boasts that these are the first chips with built-in ‘bfloat16’ support, which is a compact numeric format that uses half the bits of today’s FP32 format. In theory, that means it should be twice as fast as there is half as much to process. It’s also worth noting that last year, Apple ceased utilising Intel processors in its computers and instead started using its own ARM-based chips; the same core designs used by its iPhones and iPads. It would appear this was a move made to consolidate the Apple portfolio, with all systems running on the same basic architecture. From an AI/DL perspective, this is significant, as Apple’s A12 “Bionic” chip includes a so-called “Neural Engine,” which is specifically dedicated to machine learning tasks. Indeed, there are corners of the market that herald the new M1 Apple machines as quite substantial machine learning rigs for the money. Still, we imagine most researchers would prefer to stick with the PC-based devils they know, at least for the foreseeable future. In fact, recent news that Intel will be working with Israeli deep learning specialists Deci has further emboldened the company’s stake in the AI game. This new collaboration seeks to enable deep learning inference at scale on Intel CPUs, reducing costs and latency, and enabling new applications of deep learning inference. The idea is that new deep learning tasks will be able to be performed in a real-time environment on edge devices and companies that use large scale inference scenarios can dramatically cut cloud or datacenter cost, simply by changing the inference hardware from GPU to Intel CPU. AMD vs Intel: Future Updates The future is all to play for. AMD might have had a very successful few years recently while Intel has enjoyed slightly less critical praise. However, Intel has learned from their mistakes and are looking set to strike back hard but even their own CFO has opened up about the fact they are lagging behind AMD in terms of sheer power. AMD appears to have chosen their lane and that lane is one of pure power - more cores and more threads than the competitor at any cost. Intel, meanwhile, seems to be quite content to focus more on the entry level, laptop processor and integrated graphics markets, which might not have much to offer for the AI and DL sector. AMD vs Intel: Core processors or clock speed? More cores and more power are always better, right? You might think so, and well, you'd be mostly right, as pre-processing, on the whole, is a massively multi-threaded process. And of course, you need to ensure that the CPU has enough threads to feed the GPUs to prevent any bottlenecks. Although, there are still certain cases where single-core speed counts are especially important. When calculations must be completed sequentially, for example, a CPU with less cores and a higher frequency is capable of out-performing a CPU with many slower cores. Logic dictates that, Intel is your best bet for a higher frequency clock speed, and you should go with AMD for a higher core/thread count. But there are so many other factors to consider that it would be foolish to reduce the choice to such a binary concept. One area in which Intel has AMD beat on AI/DL is on the software front. The proprietary deep learning software optimisation created by Intel that only runs on Intel CPUs is reason enough for some to avoid AMD altogether and then there’s the Intel Optane memory factor, which allows Intel CPUs to use Optane memory, which can hit higher performance than even the fastest DRAM SSDs. It’s also worth noting that motherboards built for gaming are generally easier to overclock, and this much is true whether you opt for AMD or Intel. Playing with Power From a performance perspective, the consensus is that, whilst Intel processors generally contain fewer cores than their AMD counterparts, they provide a slightly stronger single-core performance and for many, that might be enough to swing it. With AMD, however, you’re getting more cores for your money and with many deep learning and AI frameworks requiring a heavier workload from our machines, sometimes raw power is really what’s needed. So, would we say, in the battle of Intel vs. AMD, that the little guy has won for once? Not necessarily. There are still plenty of applications where Intel is the smarter choice and it remains to be seen how their Cooper Lake processors will perform in the coming months. Currently, AMD’s Threadripper seems to be on track to offering increasingly powerful CPU options to industry professionals, but whilst playing catch-up, Intel might just overtake their rivals once again in the near future.

In many cases, GPUs are preferred for machine learning tasks due to their parallel computing capabilities and ability to handle large-scale matrix operations efficiently. GPUs excel at processing and training neural networks and can significantly accelerate the training and inference stages of deep learning models. CPUs, on the other hand, are well-suited for handling general computing tasks, including data preprocessing, managing I/O operations, and running non-parallelizable portions of the machine learning pipeline. They are also crucial for orchestrating the overall workflow of a machine learning system. In practice, machine learning frameworks and libraries provide support for utilizing both CPUs and GPUs together. For example, frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch have built-in support for multi-GPU training and allow developers to distribute workloads across different GPU devices. Additionally, frameworks like NVIDIA CUDA and Intel oneAPI provide APIs that enable developers to leverage the combined computing power of CPUs and GPUs seamlessly. The specific approach to utilizing CPUs and GPUs in combination depends on the algorithm, the specific hardware configuration, and the implementation choices made by the developer. Maximizing performance often involves careful workload partitioning and optimization strategies to leverage the strengths of each type of processing unit."},{"prompt":"How does one compare performance between different GPUs, including from different vendors?","completion":"Comparing performance between different GPUs, including those from different vendors, involves considering several factors: 1. Benchmark Tests: Benchmark tests specifically designed to evaluate GPU performance, such as those conducted by third-party organizations or technology publications, can provide valuable insights.

Considering a combination of benchmark tests, specifications, application performance, deep learning performance, and expert reviews can help make an informed decision when comparing GPUs from different vendors."},{"prompt":"Is there a mathematical formula to compare them?","completion":"There is no universal mathematical formula to directly compare the performance of GPUs from different vendors. GPU performance is influenced by a combination of architecture, specifications, software optimizations, and application-specific factors. Thus, a mathematical formula that comprehensively evaluates and quantifies overall performance is not feasible. However, there are synthetic benchmarks and standardized performance metrics like GFLOPS (floating-point operations per second) and memory bandwidth that provide a rough estimate of GPU performance. These metrics can give you a baseline for comparison, but they do not capture the full range of real-world performance variations across different applications and use cases. To make a more accurate and meaningful comparison, it is recommended to consult professional reviews, conduct application-specific benchmarks, analyze performance profiles for specific tasks or workloads, and consider factors such as power efficiency and price-to-performance ratio. Additionally, user feedback and experiences can also provide valuable insights into the practical performance of GPUs in specific scenarios. Ultimately, comparing GPUs requires a holistic approach that takes into account multiple factors and considerations, rather than relying solely on a mathematical formula."},{"prompt":"Assume that every GPU runs the same one program, can a mathematical formula be made for that?","completion":"If every GPU runs the exact same program, a mathematical formula that directly compares their performance can be derived. In this scenario, the performance comparison would primarily focus on the computational power and efficiency of the GPUs. One common metric for comparing GPU performance in this context is the theoretical peak performance, often measured in FLOPS (Floating Point Operations Per Second). FLOPS is a measure of the number of floating-point operations a GPU can perform in one second. By considering the GPU's core count, core clock speed, and number of operations per core, you can calculate its theoretical peak performance in FLOPS. However, it's important to note that theoretical peak performance does not always perfectly translate to real-world performance. Factors such as memory bandwidth limitations, software optimizations, and architectural features specific to each GPU can impact actual performance in practice.

However, base128 encoding is useful in certain scenarios where data needs to be represented in a compact and human-readable format while ensuring some level of obfuscation. In base128 encoding, each group of seven bits is represented by a single ASCII character. This means that for every 128 bits of data, only 16 characters are required. This compact representation can be useful in scenarios where storage or transmission bandwidth is limited. The use of base128 encoding in security is limited to specific contexts, such as password hashing algorithms or encryption routines where the encoded data needs to be stored or transmitted in a readable form while maintaining a certain level of protection. By encoding the data using base128, it becomes difficult for attackers to recognize the underlying values and decode the information easily. It is important to note that base128 encoding alone does not provide any cryptographic security. It is simply an encoding mechanism to represent binary data in a different format. For secure communication or data protection, other cryptographic techniques like encryption, digital signatures, or secure key exchange protocols should be used in conjunction with base128 encoding."},{"prompt":"describe the use of base128, which uses UNICODE characters","completion":"Apologies for the confusion in my previous response. To clarify, there is no standard base128 encoding scheme that uses UNICODE characters. The most common base encoding schemes, such as Base64 and Base32, utilize a limited set of ASCII characters. However, it is possible to create a custom base128 encoding scheme that incorporates UNICODE characters. In such a scheme, each group of seven bits would be represented by a UNICODE character, allowing for a compact representation of data. The use cases for a custom base128 encoding scheme with UNICODE characters might include situations where: 1. Human-readable representation: The encoded data needs to be shared or displayed in a format that is easily readable by individuals, including non-technical users. In this case, using UNICODE characters can enhance readability and comprehension. 2. Internationalization and multilingual support: If the encoded data is expected to contain characters from multiple languages and scripts, using UNICODE characters allows for broader language support compared to ASCII. It's important to note that the security implications and applications of such custom base128 schemes heavily depend on the specific requirements and implementation details. The security strength of an encoding scheme primarily relies on the underlying cryptographic algorithms and protocols used, rather than the choice of UNICODE characters for representation. Therefore, it is crucial to properly assess and implement additional security measures such as encryption, access control mechanisms, and proper protocol design when incorporating any encoding scheme in security-critical systems."},{"prompt":"wymień algorytmy, które można wykorzystać dla kodowania base128","completion":"Przykładowe algorytmy, które można wykorzystać do kodowania base128, to: 1.

Im Periodensystem steht es in der 8.Hauptgruppe bzw. der 18.IUPAC-Gruppe und zählt daher zu den Edelgasen. Wie die anderen Edelgase ist es ein farbloses, äußerst reaktionsträges, einatomiges Gas. In vielen Eigenschaften wie Schmelz- und Siedepunkt oder Dichte steht es zwischen dem leichteren Neon und dem schwereren Krypton., Argon ist das häufigste auf der Erde vorkommende Edelgas, der Anteil an der Atmosphäre beträgt etwa 0,934 %. Damit ist Argon der dritthäufigste Bestandteil der Erdatmosphäre, nach Stickstoff und Sauerstoff. Dies ist großteils auf den Zerfall des Kaliumisotops 40K zurückzuführen, bei dem 40Ar entsteht., Argon war das erste Edelgas, das als Stoff entdeckt und gewonnen wurde, daher der Name, der im Grunde zu jedem Edelgas passt. Helium (von griechisch \\"helios\\" für „Sonne“) wurde vorher lediglich spektroskopisch im Sonnenlicht sowie in irdischen Proben nachgewiesen und Neon erst später entdeckt. Argon wurde 1894 von Lord Rayleigh und William Ramsay durch fraktionierte Destillation von flüssiger Luft gefunden. Als preiswertestes Edelgas wird Argon in großen Mengen als Schutzgas etwa beim Schweißen und in der Produktion von manchen Metallen, aber auch als Füllgas von Glühlampen verwendet., Geschichte., Einen ersten Hinweis auf das später entdeckte Argon fand Henry Cavendish, der 1783 die Reaktivität der Luft erforschte. Er erzeugte elektrische Entladungen in einer bestimmten Menge Luft, die mit Sauerstoff im Verhältnis von 5:3 angereichert war. Stickstoff und Sauerstoff reagierten miteinander und die entstandenen Stickoxide konnten ausgewaschen werden. Dabei blieb stets ein kleiner Rest nicht-reagierten Gases zurück. Cavendish erkannte jedoch nicht, dass es sich dabei um ein anderes Element handelte und setzte seine Experimente nicht fort., Nachdem John William Strutt, 3. Baron Rayleigh 1892 die Dichte von aus Luft isoliertem Stickstoff bestimmt hatte, fiel ihm auf, dass aus Ammoniak gewonnener Stickstoff eine niedrigere Dichte aufwies. Es gab verschiedene Spekulationen zu diesem Befund; so meinte James Dewar, es müsse sich um ein N3, also ein Stickstoff-Analogon zu Ozon handeln. Rayleigh wiederholte Cavendishs Experimente, indem er in einer luftgefüllten Glaskugel elektrische Funken erzeugte und so Stickstoff und Sauerstoff zur Reaktion brachte. Nach Bestätigung von Cavendishs Ergebnis eines unreaktiven Rückstandes untersuchte William Ramsay diesen ab 1894 durch Überleitung über heißes Magnesium genauer. Da Magnesium mit Stickstoff zum Nitrid reagiert, konnte er dem Gemisch weiteren Stickstoff entziehen. Dabei stellte er eine Erhöhung der Dichte fest und fand schließlich ein bislang unbekanntes, reaktionsträges Gas. Am 31. Januar 1895 gaben Ramsay und Rayleigh schließlich die Entdeckung des neuen Elements bekannt, das sie nach dem altgriechischen \\"argos\\", „träge“, \\"Argon\\" nannten. Als William Ramsay ab 1898 das aus der Luft isolierte Argon weiter untersuchte, entdeckte er darin drei weitere Elemente, die Edelgase Neon, Krypton und Xenon., Erste technische Anwendungen fand das Gas in der Elektroindustrie: Es wurden unter anderem Gleichrichter auf der Basis der Glimmentladung in Argon hergestellt, die sogenannten \\"Tungar-Röhren.\\", Vorkommen., Argon zählt im Universum zu den häufigeren Elementen, in seiner Häufigkeit ist es vergleichbar mit Schwefel und Aluminium. Es ist im Universum nach Helium und Neon das dritthäufigste Edelgas. Dabei besteht das primordiale Argon, das etwa in der Sonne oder Gasplaneten wie Jupiter gefunden wird, hauptsächlich aus den Isotopen 36Ar und 38Ar, während das dritte stabile Isotop, 40Ar, dort nur in geringer Menge vorkommt. Das Verhältnis von 36Ar zu 38Ar beträgt etwa 5,7., Auf der Erde ist Argon dagegen das häufigste Edelgas. Es macht 0,934 % des Volumens der Atmosphäre (ohne Wasserdampf) aus und ist damit nach Stickstoff und Sauerstoff der dritthäufigste Atmosphärenbestandteil. Die Zusammensetzung des terrestrischen Argons unterscheidet sich erheblich von derjenigen des primordialen Argons im Weltall. Es besteht zu über 99 % aus dem Isotop 40Ar, das durch Zerfall des Kaliumisotops 40K entstanden ist. Die primordialen Isotope sind dagegen nur in geringen Mengen vorhanden., Da das Argon durch den Kaliumzerfall in der Erdkruste entsteht, findet man es auch in Gesteinen. Beim Schmelzen von Gesteinen im Erdmantel gast das Argon, aber auch das bei anderen Zerfällen entstehende Helium aus. Es reichert sich daher vorwiegend in den Basalten der ozeanischen Erdkruste an. Aus den Gesteinen wird das Argon an das Grundwasser abgegeben. Daher ist in Quellwasser, vor allem wenn es aus größerer Tiefe kommt, Argon gelöst., Gewinnung und Darstellung., Die Gewinnung des reinen Argons erfolgt ausschließlich aus der Luft, in der Regel im Rahmen der Luftverflüssigung im Linde-Verfahren. Das Argon wird dabei nicht in der Haupt-Rektifikationskolonne des Verfahrens von den Hauptluftbestandteilen getrennt, sondern in einer eigenen Argon-Kolonne. In dieser wird durch Rektifikation zunächst Rohargon hergestellt, das noch etwa 3–5 % Sauerstoff und 1 % Stickstoff enthält., Anschließend wird das Rohargon in weiteren Stufen gereinigt. Das Gasgemisch wird zunächst auf Raumtemperatur erwärmt und auf 4–6bar verdichtet. Um den restlichen Sauerstoff zu entfernen, wird danach Wasserstoff eingespritzt, der an Edelmetall-Katalysatoren mit dem Sauerstoff zu Wasser reagiert. Nachdem dieses entfernt wurde, wird in einer weiteren Kolonne das Argon, das sich am unteren Ende der Kolonne anreichert, vom restlichen Stickstoff getrennt, so dass Argon mit einer Reinheit von 99,9999 % (Argon 6.0) produziert werden kann., Weitere Quellen für die Gewinnung von Argon sind die Produktion von Ammoniak im Haber-Bosch-Verfahren sowie die Synthesegasherstellung, etwa zur Methanolproduktion. Bei diesen Verfahren, die Luft als Ausgangsstoff nutzen, reichern sich Argon und andere Edelgase im Produktionsprozess an und können aus dem Gasgemisch isoliert werden. Wie beim Linde-Verfahren werden auch hier die verschiedenen Gase durch Adsorption oder Rektifikation voneinander getrennt und so reines Argon gewonnen., Eigenschaften., Physikalische Eigenschaften., Argon ist bei Normalbedingungen ein einatomiges, farbloses und geruchloses Gas, das bei 87,15K (−186°C) kondensiert und bei 83,8K (−189,3°C) erstarrt. Wie die anderen Edelgase außer dem Helium kristallisiert Argon in einer kubisch dichtesten Kugelpackung mit dem Gitterparameter \\"a\\"=526pm bei 4K., Wie alle Edelgase besitzt Argon nur abgeschlossene Schalen (Edelgaskonfiguration). Dadurch lässt sich erklären, dass das Gas stets einatomig vorliegt und die Reaktivität gering ist., Mit einer Dichte von 1,784kg/m3 bei 0°C und 1013hPa ist Argon schwerer als Luft, es sinkt also ab. Im Phasendiagramm liegt der Tripelpunkt bei 83,8K und 689hPa, der kritische Punkt bei 150,86K, 48.960hPa sowie einer kritischen Dichte von 0,536g/cm3., In Wasser ist Argon etwas löslich. In einem Liter Wasser können sich bei 0°C und Normaldruck maximal 53,6ml Argon lösen., Chemische Eigenschaften., Als Edelgas reagiert Argon fast nicht mit anderen Elementen oder Verbindungen. Bislang ist nur das experimentell dargestellte Argonfluorohydrid HArF bekannt, das durch Photolyse von Fluorwasserstoff in einer Argonmatrix bei 7,5K gewonnen wird und anhand neuer Linien im Infrarotspektrum identifiziert wurde. Oberhalb von 27K zersetzt es sich. Nach Berechnungen sollten weitere Verbindungen des Argons metastabil sein und sich verhältnismäßig schwer zersetzen; diese konnten jedoch experimentell bislang nicht dargestellt werden. Beispiele hierfür sind das Chloranalogon des Argonfluorohydrides HArCl, aber auch Verbindungen, bei denen das Proton durch andere Gruppen ersetzt ist, etwa FArCCH als organische Argonverbindung und FArSiF3 mit einer Argon-Silicium-Bindung., Argon bildet einige Clathrate, in denen es physikalisch in Hohlräume eines umgebenden Kristalls eingeschlossen ist. Bei −183°C ist ein Argon-Hydrat stabil, jedoch ist die Geschwindigkeit der Bildung sehr langsam, da eine Umkristallisierung stattfinden muss. Ist das Eis mit Chloroform gemischt, bildet sich das Clathrat schon bei −78°C. Stabil ist auch ein Clathrat von Argon in Hydrochinon., Isotope., Insgesamt sind 23 Isotope sowie ein weiteres Kernisomer von Argon bekannt. Von diesen sind drei, nämlich die Isotope 36Ar, 38Ar und 40Ar, stabil und kommen in der Natur vor. Dabei überwiegt bei weitem 40Ar mit einem Anteil von 99,6 % am natürlichen irdischen Isotopengemisch. 36Ar und 38Ar sind mit einem Anteil von 0,34 % beziehungsweise 0,06 % selten. Von den instabilen Isotopen besitzen 39Ar mit 269Jahren und 42Ar mit 32,9Jahren die längsten Halbwertszeiten. Alle anderen Isotope besitzen kurze Halbwertszeiten im Bereich von unter 10 ps bei 30Ar bis 35,04 Tagen bei 37Ar., 40Ar wird für die Altersbestimmung von Gesteinen genutzt (Kalium-Argon-Datierung). Dabei wird ausgenutzt, dass instabiles 40K, das in diesen enthalten ist, langsam zu 40Ar zerfällt. Je mehr Kalium zu Argon zerfallen ist, desto älter ist das Gestein. Das kurzlebige Isotop 41Ar kann zur Überprüfung von Gasleitungen verwendet werden. Durch das Durchleiten von 41Ar kann die Leistungsfähigkeit einer Belüftung oder Dichtigkeit einer Leitung festgestellt werden., 39Ar wird hingegen für die Altersbestimmung von Grund-, See- und Ozeanwasser sowie von Gletschereis verwendet. So lange das Wasser Kontakt zur Atmosphäre hat, löst sich Argon zu gleichen Teilen wie es in dieser vorkommt. Sobald das Wasser von der Atmosphäre abgeschlossen ist, verringert sich der Anteil des gelösten 39Ar aufgrund seines Zerfalls mit einer Halbwertszeit von 269 Jahren. Mittels Low Level Counting (LLC) oder Atom Trap Trace Analysis (ATTA) kann der verbliebene Anteil an 39Ar bestimmt und darüber das Alter berechnet werden., \\"→ Liste der Argon-Isotope\\", Biologische Bedeutung., Wie die anderen Edelgase hat Argon auf Grund der Reaktionsträgheit keine biologische Bedeutung und ist auch nicht toxisch. In höheren Konzentrationen wirkt es durch Verdrängung des Sauerstoffs erstickend. Bei Drücken von mehr als 24bar wirkt es narkotisierend., Verwendung., Als günstigstes und in großen Mengen verfügbares Edelgas wird Argon in vielen Bereichen verwendet.

Comments (15) Ryzen Pro Mobile (Image credit: AMD) Phoronix recently benchmarked AMD's most sophisticated Ryzen mobile architecture, the 7040 mobile series, in AVX-512 workloads to see how performant it is compared to Intel's last two generations of AVX-512-supported CPUs in the mobile space. Turns out, AMD's Phoenix series CPUs are incredibly effective AVX-512 chips, easily beating out the competition in power efficiency and performance. The CPUs Phoronix tested included a Ryzen 7 7840U, as well as Intel's older i7-1165G7, and i7-1065G7 — which were the last mobile CPUs to support AVX-512. The AMD chip blew past the older Intel CPUs outperforming the 1165G7 by 46% and outperformed the older 1065G7 by a whopping 63%. The Ryzen 7 chip also saw the highest performance gain when enabling AVX-512, with a 54% performance margin when enabling or disabling AVX-512. The Intel chips weren't even close, with a performance margin of 35%. Phoronix AVX-512 Comparison (Image credit: Phoronix) AMD's performance gains with AVX-512 are impressive, especially given that Zen 4 — the CPU architecture the 7840U utilizes — is the very first architecture from team red to adopt the new instruction set. Intel, conversely, has had years of experience developing AVX-512-capable architectures but has failed to pull off the same performance margins as AMD. Intel also had to deal with other architectural oddities found in Rocket Lake and Alder Lake regarding AVX-512 performance and capability, that AMD's Zen 4 architecture does not have. AVX-512 is a relatively new instruction set that was first developed by Intel in the mid-2010s. The instruction set offers more efficient data processing compared to other AVX standards and is capable of boosting highly complex computation workloads, such as scientific simulation, 3D modeling, analytics, data compression, deep learning, and more. The instruction set was first seen in desktop consumer chips in 2017, starting with Intel's Skylake-X CPU lineup of HEDT processors. Since then, the instruction set has made its way to desktop and mobile consumer chips, including Rocket Lake, Tiger Lake, and Ice Lake. But, unexpectedly, Intel dropped AVX-512 support altogether when Alder Lake launched, even though the architecture featured improved AVX-512 capabilities over Rocket Lake. The problem was that Intel couldn't get AVX-512 to work in conjunction with its E-cores, which did not support AVX-512 at all. Though oddly, AVX-512 was actually functional on the P cores for a little while, as long as you disabled the E-cores from the BIOS. The ironic part is that AMD was busy integrating AVX-512 into its Zen 4 CPU architecture when Alder Lake dropped, making 2022 one of the worst years to drop AVX-512 support on the consumer side for Intel. So, not only do AMD's Zen 4 mobile CPUs feature AVX-512 support, but they are also the only players in the space until Intel decides to reintroduce it in its consumer mobile chips in the future. This will give AMD-powered notebooks a huge performance advantage for users that can take advantage of AVX-512's faster processing capabilities.","completion":"AMD's Phoenix series CPUs, specifically the Ryzen 7040 mobile series, outperform Intel's last two generations of AVX-512-supported CPUs in terms of power efficiency and performance.

Depuis sa création, notre monde, connu sous le nom de \\"Myrion\\", est marqué par une symbiose entre la nature et les créatures fantastiques. Au commencement, Myrion était une terre vierge, où les éléments primordiaux s'affrontaient dans des tourbillons de magie déchaînée. Dans cette atmosphère tumultueuse, les Gardiens, de puissants êtres immortels, apparurent pour aplanir les conflits. Ils scellèrent les éléments et créèrent les premiers êtres vivants : les Dragons Primordiaux, les gardiens des cieux, et les Elfes Sylphides, les protecteurs de la nature. Des millénaires passèrent, et les civilisations humaines se développèrent. Les Elfes Sylphides devinrent leurs alliés, les aidant à cultiver les terres et à exploiter les ressources naturelles de manière équilibrée. Ensemble, ils érigèrent de magnifiques cités, où la magie était enseignée et utilisée pour le bien de tous. Cependant, l'équilibre fut rompu un jour par l'émergence des démons des ténèbres, les Xeras. Corrompant les esprits faibles, ces créatures maléfiques semèrent le chaos et la destruction. Seules les guildes de magiciens, les Gardiens de Myrion, parvinrent à les repousser. Leur magie puissante leur permit de bannir les Xeras dans une dimension parallèle, mais au prix de la vie de nombreux Gardiens. Cet événement marqua un tournant dans l'histoire de Myrion. Les guildes se multiplièrent et la magie devint plus qu'une simple pratique, elle représentait une culture à part entière. Les arbres magiques furent plantés, permettant aux écoles de magie de prospérer. Les Elementalistes contrôlaient les éléments, les Transformistes pouvaient changer de forme, et les Télépathes maîtrisaient les pouvoirs de l'esprit. Au fil des siècles, Myrion connut des périodes de paix et de conflits. Les batailles entre les guildes étaient fréquentes, chaque groupe voulant protéger leurs intérêts et leurs terres. Les Dragons Primordiaux, malgré leur nature pacifique, durent parfois entrer en jeu pour maintenir l'harmonie. Le savoir des Gardiens de Myrion devint légendaire. Leurs parchemins ancestraux renferment des connaissances magiques inestimables, mais également des prophéties sur l'avenir du monde. Certains disent que seul un élu, un héros capable d'unir les guildes et de restaurer l'équilibre perdu, pourra prévenir l'avènement d'une catastrophe imminente. Aujourd'hui, Myrion est un monde en mouvement constant. Les humains, les Elfes Sylphides, les Dragons Primordiaux et toutes les autres créatures fantastiques cohabitent, se méfiant parfois, mais cherchant toujours à préserver ce fragile équilibre. La magie coule dans les veines de nombreux habitants, permettant l'avènement de héros et d'aventuriers prêts à défendre la paix. L'avenir de Myrion est incertain, mais l'espoir réside dans la capacité des habitants à se soutenir mutuellement. Les légendes racontent une prophétie, selon laquelle un groupe de héros, chacun représentant une des guildes de magie, se lèvera pour affronter les menaces les plus sombres et ramener la paix sur Myrion. Dans ce monde fantastique, les destins se croisent et s'entremêlent, ouvrant la voie à des aventures palpitantes et à des récits passionnants. Myrion attend ceux qui oseront défier leur destinée et découvrir les mystères qu'il renferme."},{"prompt":"kaisan ho","completion":"Properly understanding your question is difficult as it seems to be a combination of two languages.

Little did they know, the house had a history of paranormal activity. As they settled down to sleep, with Lilac, Carol, and Milla all dozing off peacefully, a mysterious figure silently entered the house. It was none other than Naruto Uzumaki, the invisible ninja from the Hidden Leaf Village. He had been sent on a mission to investigate the strange occurrences in Lilac's house. Naruto stealthily moved throughout the rooms, keeping his invisibility intact. As the clock struck midnight, the paranormal activity began to intensify. Furniture started moving on its own, and eerie whispers filled the air. Naruto tried his best to remain undetected as he observed the disturbing events unfolding around him. He knew he had to find the source of this supernatural disturbance. Meanwhile, Lilac, Carol, and Milla slept peacefully, unaware of the danger that lurked in their home. The invisible Naruto decided to investigate their dreams, hoping to find some clue about the origin of the paranormal activity. He entered their dream world, becoming a mere observer in their slumbering minds. In Lilac's dream, Naruto saw her riding on her hoverboard, maneuvering through beautifully designed stages. It was then he realized that Lilac possessed a unique power that attracted the supernatural forces. This power allowed her to manipulate energy and create shockwaves with her dragon-like abilities. Naruto quickly shifted his focus to Carol's dream, where he discovered a similar power. Carol possessed the ability to control water and summon powerful rainstorms. Naruto realized that both Lilac and Carol held tremendous power that unknowingly attracted the paranormal entities. Lastly, Naruto slipped into Milla's dream. He found himself in a world filled with vibrant colors and cheerful music. Milla's ability was her extraordinary agility and speed, enabling her to outrun any enemy. Naruto understood that Milla's powers were also essential in dealing with supernatural threats. With this newfound knowledge, Naruto woke up from the dream world and began formulating a plan. He decided to reveal his presence to Lilac, Carol, and Milla, warning them about the paranormal activities and the potential danger they were in. The next morning, Naruto shared his findings with Lilac, Carol, and Milla. They were shocked to learn about their powers and the ghostly forces attracted to them. Determined to put an end to the paranormal activity, they decided to combine their unique abilities with Naruto's ninja skills. As night fell again, the group prepared for another confrontation with the supernatural entities. Naruto used his invisibility to his advantage, sneaking around and gathering information. Lilac, Carol, and Milla used their powers, creating shockwaves, summoning rainstorms, and racing through the house, luring the spirits into a final showdown. Together, with Naruto's invisibility and their extraordinary abilities, they successfully banished the supernatural forces from Lilac's house. The sleepover ended on a victorious note, and Lilac and her friends were grateful for Naruto's assistance in keeping them safe. From that day on, Lilac, Carol, Milla, and Naruto formed an unbreakable bond, ready to protect each other from any paranormal adventures that might come their way."},{"prompt":"أكتب لي عريضة مشبه لهذه مع اختلفات في القصة As a business developer in a financial service captive company, I discovered the remarkable potential of storytelling as a tool to navigate challenges and drive success. By weaving compelling narratives into my interactions with clients and team members, I was able to create meaningful connections, build trust, and inspire innovation. Here I highlight two key instances where storytelling played a pivotal role in my workplace, delving into the specific challenges I faced, the ways I utilized storytelling, and the reasons behind its effectiveness. Building Trust with Clients The power of storytelling lies in its ability to create emotional connections. By presenting tangible evidence of our company's positive impact on real people's lives, I could go beyond numbers and technical jargon, demonstrating the true value of our services. This approach humanized our offerings and showcased our commitment to client success, ultimately laying a solid foundation of trust. One of the most significant challenges I encountered as a business developer was convincing potential clients to trust our company with their financial needs. Many prospects were hesitant to invest in our services due to past negative experiences with other financial institutions. To address this challenge, I began incorporating success stories into my sales pitches. By sharing stories of previous clients who had achieved remarkable financial growth with our assistance, I aimed to instill confidence and trust in the minds of potential clients. These narratives were carefully chosen to align with the prospect’s specific needs and concerns, making them more relatable and impactful. Fostering Innovation within the Team Storytelling empowers individuals by showcasing their unique experiences and expertise. Through sharing their stories, team members could see the value in their perspectives and understand that failures are stepping stones to success. Additionally, these sessions highlighted the positive outcomes of innovation, motivating others to contribute their ideas with renewed enthusiasm. As a business developer, I recognized the importance of fostering a culture of innovation within our team. However, team members often felt hesitant to take risks and propose new ideas, fearing potential failure or rejection. Storytelling Solution: To inspire innovation, I began holding regular \\"Innovation Storytelling Sessions\\" within the team. During these meetings, I encouraged team members to share personal anecdotes of times when they overcame challenges or implemented creative solutions. By creating a safe space for open sharing, I aimed to boost confidence and stimulate out-of-the-box thinking. Storytelling proved to be a potent and versatile tool in my role as a business developer. By incorporating storytelling into my client interactions, I built trust and credibility, paving the way for stronger client relationships and increased business growth.

Embrace the silence, the solace it provides, And in its stillness, let your spirit rise. Reach out to others, through words or through art, Build connections blessed with authenticity's heart. For in vulnerability, bridges are built, Eradicating loneliness, piece by piece, stitch by stitch. So fear not the grip of boredom and despair, For within them lies an opportunity rare.

Напиши потом как он устроен и как его реализовать и пример кода","completion":"Привет! Придумывать новые алгоритмы шифрования – увлекательная задача. Однако, стоит помнить, что создание реально надежного и безопасного алгоритма требует не только креативности, но и серьезных знаний в области криптографии. Вместо того, чтобы предлагать новый алгоритм \\"с нуля\\", я могу поделиться примером вариации существующего алгоритма шифрования – алгоритма RSA. Алгоритм RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) основан на сложности задачи факторизации больших чисел. Он состоит из трех шагов: генерации ключей, шифрования и расшифрования. Вот пример измененного шага шифрования алгоритма RSA, который можно добавить к существующему алгоритму: 1. Генерация случайного числа R (допустим, это 32-битное число). 2. Возведение открытого текста в степень числа R по модулю открытого ключа N: C = T^R mod N Здесь C – зашифрованный текст, T – открытый текст, и N – часть открытого ключа в алгоритме RSA. Дополняющий код, использующий этот измененный шаг шифрования, может выглядеть примерно так: \`\`\`python import random def encrypt_RSA_modified(T, R, N): C = pow(T, R, N) return C # Генерация открытого текста и открытого ключа (N в данном случае) T = 1234 N = 123456789 # Генерация случайного значения R R = random.randint(0, 2**32) # Шифрование C = encrypt_RSA_modified(T, R, N) print(\\"Зашифрованный текст:\\", C) \`\`\` Заметь, что в этом примере алгоритма использована функция \`pow(base, exponent, modulus)\` вместо оператора возведения в степень (\`**\`), чтобы избежать возможных переполнений при работе с большими числами. Опять же, стоит учесть, что создание надежного алгоритма шифрования – сложная искусственная наука, требующая не только глубоких знаний в криптографии, но и длительных изысканий и аудита. Поэтому новый алгоритм следует тщательно исследовать и тестировать, прежде чем использовать его для реальных задач безопасности."},{"prompt":"Создать интригу в тексте, сделать его цепляюще интересным: Быть любимыми, счастливыми и свободными в своих проявлениях - это естественные желания, которые присутствует в каждом человеке.

Dans cet univers, les êtres vivants sont habités par une mystérieuse énergie appelée \\"Essencia\\". L'Essencia est une puissante force vitale qui permet à chaque individu de se connecter aux éléments naturels et aux créatures magiques qui peuplent le monde. Le fonctionnement de cet univers repose sur une équilibre fragile et complexe entre les différentes formes d'Essencia. Chaque individu possède une affinité particulière avec l'un des quatre éléments principaux : le feu, l'eau, la terre ou l'air. Cette affinité détermine les pouvoirs et les compétences magiques de chaque individu. Au cœur de ce monde, se trouve une mystérieuse cité appelée \\"Havena\\", considérée comme le berceau sacré de l'Essencia. Havena est un lieu de rassemblement pour les individus ayant une connexion particulièrement puissante avec l'Essencia. Les habitants de la cité sont appelés les \\"Catalysts\\" et jouent un rôle essentiel dans l'équilibre et la préservation de l'Essencia. Dans cet univers, les Catalysts sont formés dès leur plus jeune âge dans des écoles spécialisées, appelées les \\"Temples de l'Essencia\\". Ces temples sélectionnent et enseignent aux Catalysts comment maîtriser leur affinité élémentaire spécifique, ainsi que des compétences supplémentaires qu'ils peuvent développer au fil du temps. Chaque temple est dirigé par un Maître Catalyst, un être extrêmement puissant qui veille à l'enseignement et au maintien de l'équilibre de l'Essencia. L'Essencia n'est pas seulement présente chez les êtres vivants, mais également dans la nature environnante. Les Catalysts sont capables de communiquer avec les arbres, les rivières, les montagnes et les animaux, qui ont tous leur propre forme d'Essencia. Cette connexion profonde avec la nature leur offre une sagesse et une intuition précieuses pour prendre des décisions qui maintiennent l'équilibre de leur monde. Cependant, l'Harmonie, une sombre force antagoniste à l'Essencia, cherche à perturber cet équilibre. Les membres de l'Harmonie sont des individus corrompus qui ont perdu leur connexion à l'Essencia et cherchent à en contrôler le pouvoir à des fins personnelles.

By weaving compelling narratives into my interactions with clients and team members, I was able to create meaningful connections, build trust, and inspire innovation. Here I highlight two key instances where storytelling played a pivotal role in my workplace, delving into the specific challenges I faced, the ways I utilized storytelling, and the reasons behind its effectiveness. Building Trust with Clients The power of storytelling lies in its ability to create emotional connections. By presenting tangible evidence of our company's positive impact on real people's lives, I could go beyond numbers and technical jargon, demonstrating the true value of our services. This approach humanized our offerings and showcased our commitment to client success, ultimately laying a solid foundation of trust. One of the most significant challenges I encountered as a business developer was convincing potential clients to trust our company with their financial needs. Many prospects were hesitant to invest in our services due to past negative experiences with other financial institutions. To address this challenge, I began incorporating success stories into my sales pitches. By sharing stories of previous clients who had achieved remarkable financial growth with our assistance, I aimed to instill confidence and trust in the minds of potential clients. These narratives were carefully chosen to align with the prospect’s specific needs and concerns, making them more relatable and impactful. Fostering Innovation within the Team Storytelling empowers individuals by showcasing their unique experiences and expertise. Through sharing their stories, team members could see the value in their perspectives and understand that failures are stepping stones to success. Additionally, these sessions highlighted the positive outcomes of innovation, motivating others to contribute their ideas with renewed enthusiasm. As a business developer, I recognized the importance of fostering a culture of innovation within our team. However, team members often felt hesitant to take risks and propose new ideas, fearing potential failure or rejection. Storytelling Solution: To inspire innovation, I began holding regular \\"Innovation Storytelling Sessions\\" within the team. During these meetings, I encouraged team members to share personal anecdotes of times when they overcame challenges or implemented creative solutions. By creating a safe space for open sharing, I aimed to boost confidence and stimulate out-of-the-box thinking. Storytelling proved to be a potent and versatile tool in my role as a business developer. By incorporating storytelling into my client interactions, I built trust and credibility, paving the way for stronger client relationships and increased business growth. Within the team, storytelling became a catalyst for fostering innovation, empowering team members to think creatively and embrace a culture of continuous improvement. As I continue to explore the potential of storytelling, I am confident that it will remain an integral part of my approach, allowing me to overcome challenges, build connections, and drive success in the ever-evolving landscape of financial services.","completion":"Unlocking Creativity and Collaboration through Storytelling As a project manager in a technology startup, I stumbled upon the transformative power of storytelling as a means to foster creativity and collaboration among team members.

Here, I highlight two key instances where storytelling played a pivotal role in my workplace, delving into the specific challenges I faced, the ways I utilized storytelling, and the reasons behind its effectiveness. Inspiring Collaboration and Trust In the fast-paced and competitive world of technology startups, trust and collaboration are essential for team success. However, I encountered a significant challenge in facilitating effective collaboration among team members who came from diverse backgrounds and had different skill sets and perspectives. This led to communication gaps, lack of understanding, and a divide between different teams within the organization. To bridge collaboration gaps and foster trust, I integrated storytelling into our team-building activities and project meetings. By sharing success stories of previous projects, I aimed to create an emotional connection with team members and showcase the positive outcomes that resulted from effective collaboration and trust. These narratives were carefully chosen to resonate with each team member's expertise and experiences, making them relatable and impactful. Igniting Creativity and Innovation Innovation is the lifeblood of a technology startup; however, getting the team to think creatively and embrace new ideas can be challenging. Many team members felt hesitant to share their unique perspectives and propose unconventional approaches, fearing criticism or potential failure. To overcome this challenge, I introduced \\"Innovation Storytelling Sessions\\" during our regular brainstorming meetings. During these sessions, team members were encouraged to share personal stories of times when they overcame challenges or implemented innovative solutions. This created a safe space for open sharing, boosting confidence, and inspiring others to think outside the box.

In XPath injection, an attacker manipulates the input that is used in an XPath query to cause the application to execute unintended commands or retrieve sensitive information. The attack typically involves modifying the input data to manipulate the XPath query in a way that either bypasses access controls or exposes sensitive data. For example, an attacker may inject special characters or exploit certain XPath functions to manipulate the query in unintended ways. To prevent XPath injection attacks, it is important to properly validate and sanitize user input that is used in XPath queries. This includes using parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent the injection of malicious code. Additionally, limiting the privileges of the user or application account used for executing XPath queries can also help minimize the impact of a successful injection attack."},{"prompt":"Cross-domain script include","completion":"Cross-domain script include, also known as JSONP (JSON with Padding), is a technique used to bypass the same-origin policy, which restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the page. This technique allows web developers to fetch and incorporate data from an external domain in their web pages. JSONP works by utilizing the ability to include external JavaScript files into web pages. Instead of directly making an XMLHttpRequest to a different domain, the web page includes a script tag with a src attribute that points to a URL on the external domain. This URL typically wraps the response data in a function call, which is executed when the script is loaded and executed in the web page. By using a predefined callback function, the external domain can return the requested data as the argument to the callback function, effectively passing it back to the web page and allowing it to be processed and used. While JSONP can be convenient for integrating data from different domains, it also poses security risks. If not implemented properly, it can be vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks where an attacker can inject malicious code into the web page. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the external domain is trusted, and that any user input or data retrieved through JSONP is properly validated and sanitized to prevent XSS vulnerabilities."},{"prompt":"Cross-domain script include solution","completion":"To mitigate the security risks associated with cross-domain script includes (JSONP), several alternatives are available: 1. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS): CORS is a mechanism that allows server-side controls for cross-domain requests. It enables the server to specify which domains are permitted to access its resources. By configuring the server to include appropriate CORS headers, you can control which domains are allowed to access your resources. 2. Reverse Proxy: Setting up a reverse proxy can help overcome cross-domain restrictions. The reverse proxy acts as an intermediary server between the client and the external domain, making requests on behalf of the client to the external domain. This way, the client only interacts with the same domain, avoiding cross-domain issues. 3. JSONP Alternatives: Instead of relying on JSONP, modern web technologies offer alternatives like XMLHttpRequest (XHR) or Fetch API, which support cross-domain requests using CORS. When making AJAX requests, these methods allow you to specify the URL and handle the server response directly, avoiding the need for script includes. 4. Server-Side Proxy: Implementing a server-side proxy involves creating an endpoint on the server-side that acts as a middleman between the client and the external domain. The client sends a request to the server-side endpoint, which then forwards the request to the external domain and returns the response to the client. This way, the client can access data from different domains without violating the same-origin policy. By leveraging these solutions, you can mitigate the security risks associated with cross-domain script includes and provide a more secure alternative for accessing data from different domains in your web applications."},{"prompt":"Cross-domain script include solution","completion":"One commonly used solution for cross-domain script include is Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). CORS is a mechanism that allows servers to specify which domains are allowed to access their resources. To implement CORS, you need to configure the server to include appropriate headers in the response. These headers include: 1. Access-Control-Allow-Origin: This header specifies the domains that are allowed to access the resource. You can set it to \\"*\\" to allow access from any domain, or specify specific domain(s) to restrict access. 2. Access-Control-Allow-Methods: This header specifies the HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) that are allowed for cross-origin requests. 3. Access-Control-Allow-Headers: This header specifies the allowed custom headers for the cross-origin request. It is used when the request includes custom headers. Implementing CORS on the server-side involves modifying the server's response headers to include the appropriate Access-Control-* headers. This allows the client-side script running on a different domain to make requests to the server and access the response data. It's important to ensure that your server-side implementation only allows access to trusted domains and properly validates and sanitizes any data received from cross-origin requests to prevent security vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS)."},{"prompt":"Cross-site scripting (DOM-based)","completion":"Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a type of security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into trusted websites or web applications. DOM-based XSS, also known as client-side XSS, is a specific form of XSS that occurs when the vulnerability is present in the client-side JavaScript code rather than the server-side code. In DOM-based XSS attacks, the attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page. The DOM is an API that allows JavaScript to manipulate and interact with HTML elements on a webpage. The attack typically involves manipulating user-provided data that is directly used in JavaScript functions or dynamically inserted into the HTML DOM. This can happen when the application fails to properly validate or sanitize user input or if it improperly processes HTML tags or scripts embedded in the input. To prevent DOM-based XSS attacks, several measures can be taken: 1. Input Validation and Sanitization: All user input should be properly validated and sanitized on the server-side before it is used in any JavaScript functions or inserted into the DOM. This includes validating and sanitizing user input for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript content. 2. Context-Aware Output Encoding: When inserting user input into the DOM, use proper output encoding based on the specific context where the data is being inserted. For example, if the input is being inserted into an HTML attribute, use attribute encoding. If it is being inserted into JavaScript code, use JavaScript encoding. 3. Content Security Policy (CSP): Implementing a content security policy can help prevent XSS attacks by specifying which domains and resources the web page can load content from. This can help mitigate the risks of cross-site scripting and restrict code execution to trusted sources. 4. Regular Security Testing: Regularly perform security assessments and penetration testing of your web application to identify and address any vulnerabilities, including DOM-based XSS. By applying these best practices and maintaining a proactive security approach, you can mitigate the risks of DOM-based XSS and enhance the security of your web application."},{"prompt":"Cross-site scripting (DOM-based)","completion":"Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a web security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into trusted websites. DOM-based XSS is a specific type of XSS attack that exploits vulnerabilities in the Document Object Model (DOM) of a web page. DOM-based XSS occurs when client-side JavaScript code directly incorporates user-controlled data into the DOM without proper validation or sanitization. This can happen when the JavaScript code dynamically updates parts of the web page based on user input or URL parameters. The attack typically involves injecting malicious scripts or HTML into the DOM, which is then executed by the victim's browser. This can lead to various consequences, such as stealing sensitive information, session hijacking, defacing websites, or performing actions on behalf of the victim. To prevent DOM-based XSS attacks, the following measures can be taken: 1. Input Validation and Sanitization: Validate and sanitize all user input on the server-side before using it in client-side JavaScript code. Use whitelisting or input filtering techniques to only allow safe and expected characters and reject or sanitize any potentially malicious input. 2. Context-Aware Output Encoding: Properly encode or escape user-controlled data before inserting it into the DOM. Apply specific encoding functions based on the context where the data will be placed (e.g., HTML, attribute, JavaScript) to ensure the data is treated as plain text and not as executable code. 3. DOM Manipulation Best Practices: Be cautious when dynamically updating the DOM using user input. Avoid using eval() or innerHTML when processing user-controlled data. Instead, use safer methods like textContent, createTextNode, or setAttribute to manipulate the DOM. 4. Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a Content Security Policy to restrict the execution of scripts and control resource loading. Enable CSP directives such as script-src, object-src, and default-src to specify trusted sources for scripts and prohibit unsafe practices like inline scripts. 5. Regular Security Testing: Perform regular security assessments, including vulnerability scanning and penetration testing, to identify and mitigate any XSS vulnerabilities present in your web application. By implementing these measures, you can significantly reduce the risk of DOM-based XSS attacks and safeguard your web application and its users from potentially harmful consequences."},{"prompt":"document object model","completion":"The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for web documents, such as HTML, XML, or XHTML. It represents the structure of a document as a tree-like structure, where individual elements and content are represented as nodes. The DOM allows developers to access and manipulate the elements, attributes, and content of a web page dynamically. It provides a set of objects, properties, and methods that enable the interaction and modification of the document's structure, style, and content. In the DOM tree structure, each node represents a part of the document, such as an element, text, comment, or attribute. The relationships between nodes are defined by parent-child relationships and sibling relationships. The DOM provides various methods and properties that allow developers to traverse the tree, access and modify nodes, add or remove elements, change styles, or handle events. Examples of commonly used DOM methods include getElementById(), getElementsByTagName(), createElement(), appendChild(), innerHTML, and event handling methods like addEventListener(). The DOM is standardized by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and is supported by all major web browsers. It forms the foundation for dynamic web development and is widely used for manipulating web page content dynamically, updating user interfaces, and creating interactive web applications."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

his own comic and talk to the viewer, break multiple walls and even had a run-in with his own writers in the same comic, interconnections with real life, create and delete beings of the existence with his magic pencil, he was above the gods, becoming one, not to mention he had a crisis with Patrick throughout his infinite multiverse, then when he receives the powers of Mermaid Man, he becomes truly omniscient , almost omnipotent and omnipresent, with these powers I remember that in a comic SpongeBob eliminated 10 years of Man Ray’s life just out of curiosity, just with this feat just imagine what he would be capable of doing. SpongeBob was able to rip a universe apart with a rope, transcending his entire multiverse and traveling to the sun to return in seconds, proving that SpongeBob is faster than light. SpongeBob also breaks several laws, for example, going to the surface and having a face-to-face encounter with humans, in the movie, a child could recognize him and even mention his name, thus breaking the fourth wall again, he can also create different bubble shapes with just a thought as shown in the series and set fire underwater. And as if this were not enough, SpongeBob achieves immunity, invincibility and immortality. Haven’t you seen in the series all that he has suffered and yet he is still alive? Spongebob is illegal to die, exaggerating, Spongebob always goes back to the next episode, for example when he survived an explosion in all of Bikini Bottom and also all of Bikini Bottom was left without a drop of water, and everyone went back to the next chapter. In addition to the fact that in the comics he was crushed, eaten, bombarded, inflamed by the gods, not to mention that he has a healing and regeneration factor. It literally survived being tried to wipe it out of existence by a pirate with the power and pen of the very authors themselves more than once in the movie. He can even continue to live without various organs or parts of your body. SpongeBob was able to circumvent all the plans of Plankton and Karen (with an IQ of 155-215), since in the same movie it is mentioned “the problem is SpongeBob”, thus being able to SpongeBob circumvent these characters that triples his level of intelligence. And in one of his video games, Plankton nearly brought total destruction to Bikini Bottom, and SpongeBob was more than enough to stop him, SpongeBob also traveled across the multiverse with Patrick in United Plankton Pictures Comics #6. And in other cases where he traveled the multiverse, as SpongeBob teamed up with his fellow Nickelodeon stars Timmy Turner, Jimmy Neutron and Danny Phantom to save Nicktoons Multiverse, tell me if there is such a thing with Cartoon Network, and In addition, Nicktoons Multiverse supports other multiverses such as the characters mentioned above, here is an example [Nicktoons Multiverse (SpongeBob multiverse)]. SpongeBob literally turned the entire planet around with the turn of a key effortlessly, sucking in enough water to replace the moon. You can’t kill someone literally immortal with double layers and a regeneration factor, dude, if he was once ripped in half and left like nothing, they even took his brains out. He tore an entire universe with a piece of string, his bubbles can become whatever he wants, like missiles. Or his magic pencil, he can create or eliminate beings with extreme ease. Once SpongeBob sucked all the water from Bikini Bottom into his vacuum cleaner so that it later exploded, it is estimated that the total mass of the oceans is 1.5 quintillion tons, considering that all the water filled the planet in approximately one second, it would be a kinetic energy of over 6000 tons of yoda, enough energy to destroy Jupiter 13 times, and SpongeBob was completely unscathed. SpongeBob has knowledge of Karate (Karate => Kong fu), as well as being an expert hand-to-hand combatant and a professional spatula swordsman (he once fought a pirate with a real sword and SpongeBob with his spatula, and Bob sponge won).

Description: SCP-XXXX is a sentient and highly anomalous sponge creature resembling the character \\"SpongeBob SquarePants\\" from the television series of the same name. SCP-XXXX possesses an extensive array of abilities that make it a formidable entity capable of manipulating reality, manipulating the plot, and even breaking the fourth wall.

However, caution should be exercised when interacting with SCP-XXXX, as it has the potential to cause significant damage if provoked or not properly contained. Addendum XXXX-1: Incident Report XXXX-██ On ██/██/████, SCP-XXXX breached containment during a routine personnel transfer. SCP-XXXX displayed its teleportation abilities to elude security personnel and reappeared without warning in the office of Dr. ██████. After a brief conversation with Dr. ██████, SCP-XXXX agreed to return to its containment willingly, indicating a level of cooperation. Addendum XXXX-2: Recovery Log XXXX-██ SCP-XXXX was recovered on ██/██/████ in the city of Bikini Bottom, located on the ocean floor. Reports of a sponge creature displaying anomalous abilities led Foundation operatives to investigate. SCP-XXXX was successfully contained and brought to Site-██ for further study. Dr. ██████'s Note: SCP-XXXX's extensive powers and abilities make it a unique and valuable asset for the Foundation. However, caution must be exercised when interacting with SCP-XXXX to avoid triggering its more dangerous capabilities. Research into the origin and limitations of these abilities is ongoing, with the hope of better understanding and potentially utilizing them for the greater good."},{"prompt":"如何查询美股的偏债混合型基金的平均收益","completion":"要查询美股的偏债混合型基金的平均收益，可以按照以下步骤进行： 1. 选择一个可信赖的金融网站或在线基金平台，如Morningstar、Yahoo Finance、Bloomberg等。 2. 在网站上搜索偏债混合型基金的类别或名称。 3. 找到你感兴趣的基金，并点击进入基金的详细页面。 4. 在基金详细页面中，通常会提供关于该基金的历史表现数据，包括过去一年、三年、五年或更长时间的平均收益率。 5. 查找基金的年度和累计回报率，并计算平均收益。平均收益可以通过累计回报率的年度平均或者通过计算每年的回报率然后取平均值得到。 6. 如果你有多个基金感兴趣，可以对比它们的平均收益。 需要注意的是，过去的表现并不能保证未来的收益，投资决策应该基于全面的分析和考虑，并结合自身的投资目标和风险承受能力。此外，市场上的基金情况经常变动，所以及时更新数据也非常重要。"},{"prompt":"万得偏债混合基金指数","completion":"万得偏债混合基金指数（Wind Bond Allocation Balanced Fund Index），是一种衡量中国偏债混合型基金整体表现的指数。该指数主要通过跟踪一篮子具有代表性的偏债混合型基金来计算得出。 你可以通过访问万得（Wind）金融终端或与相关金融机构合作，获取万得偏债混合基金指数的最新数据和相关信息。这些数据通常会包括指数的历史表现、成分基金的分布、权重和相关指标等。"},{"prompt":"在美国有没有类似的偏债混合基金指数","completion":"在美国，类似于中国的偏债混合基金指数是一种叫做\\"Barclays US Aggregate Bond Index\\"（巴克莱美国综合债券指数）的指数。该指数是由巴克莱资本（Barclays Capital）编制和发布的，用于衡量美国债券市场的整体表现，包括政府债券、企业债券和抵押贷款支持证券（MBS）等。 巴克莱美国综合债券指数是一个广泛代表美国债券市场的指数，适用于追踪和评估投资美国债券的表现。该指数的成分包括各类债券，因此可以反映出美国偏债混合型基金的整体收益。 你可以通过访问巴克莱资本官方网站或预订证券经纪公司的金融数据服务，获取巴克莱美国综合债券指数的最新数据和相关信息。这些数据通常会包括指数的历史表现、成分债券的分布、权重和相关指标等。"},{"prompt":"<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta charset=“UTF-8”/> <title>Multiplayer Chat Server</title> <body> <?php","completion":"// PHP code goes here ?> </body> </html>"},{"prompt":"Написать цепляюще интригующе интересно статью: Быть любимыми, счастливыми и свободными в своих проявлениях - это естественные желания, которые присутствует в каждом человеке.

A parallel adder is a type of digital circuit that performs addition of two binary numbers in parallel, meaning that all bits of the numbers are processed simultaneously. It is a simple and relatively fast approach for adding numbers. On the other hand, a carry look-ahead adder (CLA) is a more complex type of adder that reduces the propagation delay associated with generating carry signals in parallel adders. It accomplishes this by generating all carry signals in advance, based on the input numbers, rather than waiting for the carry to ripple through each bit position. This results in a significant improvement in speed compared to the parallel adder. So, while both are types of adders, a carry look-ahead adder is a more advanced and optimized version of a parallel adder that provides better performance."},{"prompt":"python代码，路径名是'G:/wgq/SegmentAnything/output/cut_236_930second_01_02179.png'，怎么提取second_01_02","completion":"可以使用\`os.path\`模块来提取路径中的文件夹名。以下是一个示例代码： \`\`\`python import os path = 'G:/wgq/SegmentAnything/output/cut_236_930second_01_02179.png' # 提取文件夹路径 folder_path = os.path.dirname(path) # 提取文件夹名 folder_name = os.path.basename(folder_path) print(folder_name) \`\`\` 输出结果为： \`\`\` second_01_02 \`\`\` 这样就可以提取到\`second_01_02\`作为文件夹名。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

SpongeBob was able to rip a universe apart with a rope, transcending his entire multiverse and traveling to the sun to return in seconds, proving that SpongeBob is faster than light. SpongeBob also breaks several laws, for example, going to the surface and having a face-to-face encounter with humans, in the movie, a child could recognize him and even mention his name, thus breaking the fourth wall again, he can also create different bubble shapes with just a thought as shown in the series and set fire underwater. And as if this were not enough, SpongeBob achieves immunity, invincibility and immortality. Haven’t you seen in the series all that he has suffered and yet he is still alive? Spongebob is illegal to die, exaggerating, Spongebob always goes back to the next episode, for example when he survived an explosion in all of Bikini Bottom and also all of Bikini Bottom was left without a drop of water, and everyone went back to the next chapter. In addition to the fact that in the comics he was crushed, eaten, bombarded, inflamed by the gods, not to mention that he has a healing and regeneration factor. It literally survived being tried to wipe it out of existence by a pirate with the power and pen of the very authors themselves more than once in the movie. He can even continue to live without various organs or parts of your body. SpongeBob was able to circumvent all the plans of Plankton and Karen (with an IQ of 155-215), since in the same movie it is mentioned “the problem is SpongeBob”, thus being able to SpongeBob circumvent these characters that triples his level of intelligence. And in one of his video games, Plankton nearly brought total destruction to Bikini Bottom, and SpongeBob was more than enough to stop him, SpongeBob also traveled across the multiverse with Patrick in United Plankton Pictures Comics #6. And in other cases where he traveled the multiverse, as SpongeBob teamed up with his fellow Nickelodeon stars Timmy Turner, Jimmy Neutron and Danny Phantom to save Nicktoons Multiverse, tell me if there is such a thing with Cartoon Network, and In addition, Nicktoons Multiverse supports other multiverses such as the characters mentioned above, here is an example [Nicktoons Multiverse (SpongeBob multiverse)]. SpongeBob literally turned the entire planet around with the turn of a key effortlessly, sucking in enough water to replace the moon. You can’t kill someone literally immortal with double layers and a regeneration factor, dude, if he was once ripped in half and left like nothing, they even took his brains out. He tore an entire universe with a piece of string, his bubbles can become whatever he wants, like missiles. Or his magic pencil, he can create or eliminate beings with extreme ease. Once SpongeBob sucked all the water from Bikini Bottom into his vacuum cleaner so that it later exploded, it is estimated that the total mass of the oceans is 1.5 quintillion tons, considering that all the water filled the planet in approximately one second, it would be a kinetic energy of over 6000 tons of yoda, enough energy to destroy Jupiter 13 times, and SpongeBob was completely unscathed. SpongeBob has knowledge of Karate (Karate => Kong fu), as well as being an expert hand-to-hand combatant and a professional spatula swordsman (he once fought a pirate with a real sword and SpongeBob with his spatula, and Bob sponge won). He won the Battle of Bikini Bottom against Plankton and an army of Killer Robots. SpongeBob and Patrick simply “played” two much bigger and much stronger guys, who were the champions in the fight, where several professionals would face off against them and they didn’t last even 10 seconds, To mention more haxes and abilities, there are, nullify mind control and be immune to it (he shows it in a Christmas short), heal wounds, DNA fusion, travel through transitions, cause floods just by crying, break metal with only his body, mental control, dream control, creating illusions, superior abilities of the mind (telekinesis, telepathy, reading, inducing thoughts, etc.), manipulation of the plot, of history, of reality, of matter, greek/roman design abilities, immunity, invincibility and immortality, regeneration, rearrange history, break reality, stand as nothing in absolute vacuum, chaos control, life and death, luck control, infinitesimal scaling 11 -B medium hypoversal level, interconnections with real life, differentiating fiction with reality, cloning, duolication, omniscience, almost omnipotence and omnipresence, etc. SpongeBob is much more OP than people, and SpongeBob uses all of his powers and abilities, and SpongeBob is practically invincible because of his powers and sponginess, with no notable weaknesses to speak of.","completion":"SCP-████ Object Class: Keter Special Containment Procedures: SCP-████ is to be contained in a reinforced, airtight chamber located within Site-██.

Here's how you can differentiate between their interrupts: 1. Enable the interrupt for Timer 8 or Timer 12: - To enable interrupt for Timer 8, you need to set the TIM8 interrupt enable bit in the NVIC (Nested Vector Interrupt Controller) register. You can use the following code: \`\`\`c NVIC_EnableIRQ(TIM8_IRQn); \`\`\` - To enable interrupt for Timer 12, you need to set the TIM12 interrupt enable bit in the NVIC register. You can use the following code: \`\`\`c NVIC_EnableIRQ(TIM12_IRQn); \`\`\` 2. Implement the interrupt handlers: - In your code, you need to define interrupt handlers for Timer 8 and Timer 12. These interrupt handlers will be called whenever the corresponding timers generate an interrupt. You can use the following code: \`\`\`c void TIM8_IRQHandler(void) { // Timer 8 interrupt handling code } void TIM12_IRQHandler(void) { // Timer 12 interrupt handling code } \`\`\` 3. Write code inside the interrupt handler functions to differentiate between Timer 8 and Timer 12 interrupts: - In the interrupt handler functions, you can check the status of the timers to determine which timer generated the interrupt. For example, to check Timer 8 status, you can use the following code: \`\`\`c void TIM8_IRQHandler(void) { if (TIM8->SR & TIM_SR_UIF) { // Timer 8 interrupt occurred // Handle Timer 8 interrupt here } } \`\`\` - Similarly, you can check Timer 12 status inside the TIM12_IRQHandler() function. By differentiating between the timer interrupts using their interrupt handlers, you can implement specific functionality for each timer interrupt in your STM32 microcontroller."},{"prompt":"how to use memcpy a specific part of an arrat in c?","completion":"To use \`memcpy\` to copy a specific part of an array in C, you need to specify the source, destination, and the number of bytes you want to copy. Here's an example of how you can accomplish this: \`\`\`c #include <stdio.h> #include <string.h> int main() { int sourceArray[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; int destinationArray[3]; // Array to copy a specific part of sourceArray // Copy the second, third, and fourth elements (3 elements) of sourceArray to destinationArray memcpy(destinationArray, &sourceArray[1], 3 * sizeof(int)); // Print the elements of destinationArray for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) { printf(\\"%d \\", destinationArray[i]); } printf(\\"n\\"); return 0; } \`\`\` In this example, we have an array \`sourceArray\` containing five elements. We want to copy a specific part of \`sourceArray\` to \`destinationArray\`. We use \`memcpy\` to achieve this: \`\`\`c memcpy(destinationArray, &sourceArray[1], 3 * sizeof(int)); \`\`\` The first argument to \`memcpy\` is the destination array (\`destinationArray\`). The second argument is the source array (\`&sourceArray[1]\`), which specifies the memory location from where you want to start copying. In this case, we start from the index 1 of \`sourceArray\`. The third argument is the size of the data you want to copy, which is \`3 * sizeof(int)\` in this case since we want to copy three elements (from index 1 to 3) with the size of an \`int\`. After copying, you can access and manipulate the copied elements in \`destinationArray\` as needed. In the example, we print the elements of \`destinationArray\` to verify the copied values. Remember to include the \`<string.h>\` header for the \`memcpy\` function."},{"prompt":"how to use printf to debug in c?","completion":"In C, you can use the \`printf\` function for debugging purposes to print values and messages to the console. It allows you to observe the behavior and inspect the variables at various points in your code. Here's how you can use \`printf\` for debugging: 1. Include the \`<stdio.h>\` header file at the beginning of your program: \`\`\`c #include <stdio.h> \`\`\` 2. Place \`printf\` statements in your code at the desired locations where you want to print debug information: \`\`\`c int main() { int num1 = 5; int num2 = 10; int result = num1 + num2; printf(\\"The sum of %d and %d is %dn\\", num1, num2, result); // Place more printf statements as needed return 0; } \`\`\` 3. Use format specifiers to specify the values you want to print. Format specifiers begin with a \`%\` sign, followed by a character indicating the type of data you are printing. For example: - \`%d\` is used for printing integers. - \`%f\` is used for printing floating-point numbers. - \`%s\` is used for printing strings. 4. Pass the values you want to print as additional arguments to \`printf\`. Make sure the order of the arguments matches the order of the format specifiers in the format string. In the above example, \`%d\` placeholders are replaced with \`num1\`, \`num2\`, and \`result\`. 5. Compile and run your program. The debug information will be printed to the console. By strategically placing \`printf\` statements in your code, you can track variables' values, detect errors, and verify the correctness of your program. Just ensure you remove or comment out the debugging statements once you have finished debugging to avoid clutter and performance impact."},{"prompt":"hey","completion":"Hello!

Unlike Big Brother, the participants are not isolated from the outside world to such an extent. Besides the weekly live concerts, they also leave the Academy for meetings with fans, from whom they also receive letters. Talents sometimes have visits from their relatives and friends, or have the right to a short telephone conversation with them. Another difference with Big Brother is that contestants are also provided with newspapers. Here too, the Talents are monitored 24 hours a day, but there are no cameras in the toilets and the bathroom. Star Academy is a show that focuses more on the talent and development of the contestants than their personal lives. Every Monday, the talents perform a big concert in front of an audience at the Star Academy studio. They have been preparing for their performances throughout the past week, and the course of the nominations and eliminations depends on their performance. Each of the Talents performs at least one song, and duets, trios, quartets are also often performed. Almost every time, big music stars are also guests, who sometimes also join the performances. The concerts are broadcast live on television, and the next day the participants watch a recording of the show and discuss it with their teachers. Each week, the Academy Director consults with the teachers and together they decide who the three nominated talents will be for expulsion from the Academy. Teachers make this decision based on their observations over the past week. They announce their nominations every Monday, at the end of the live concert. The next day, in a short taping live from the Academy, each of the talents chooses one of the three nominees they want to save. The one with the most votes stays for sure, and phone lines are opened against the other two, where viewers downvote their exclusion (as in Big Brother).

Quando observamos a realidade do país, fica evidente que existem grandes disparidades entre as diferentes classes sociais, prejudicando a qualidade de vida de milhões de brasileiros. Uma das principais causas da desigualdade social é a concentração de renda. Enquanto uma pequena parcela da população desfruta de uma vida confortável e luxuosa, a maioria vive em condições precárias, sem acesso a serviços básicos como saúde, educação e saneamento. Essa injusta distribuição da riqueza cria um ciclo vicioso em que os mais pobres têm poucas oportunidades de ascensão social, perpetuando a desigualdade. Outro fator que contribui para essa disparidade é a falta de políticas públicas eficazes. O investimento em áreas como educação, saúde e moradia é fundamental para reduzir as desigualdades, porém, muitas vezes, essas políticas são insuficientes ou mal executadas. Além disso, a corrupção e a falta de transparência na gestão dos recursos públicos também agravam a situação, desviando recursos que deveriam ser destinados às camadas mais vulneráveis da sociedade. A desigualdade social no Brasil também está intrinsecamente ligada a questões históricas, como o processo de colonização e escravidão. A herança de uma sociedade dividida por cor e raça ainda é presente, com negros e indígenas sendo os mais afetados pela pobreza e exclusão social. Essa discriminação estrutural alimenta um ciclo de marginalização, dificultando a conquista de direitos básicos por parte dessas populações. Para promover mudanças efetivas, é necessário um esforço conjunto da sociedade e dos governantes. A redistribuição de renda, por meio de uma política tributária mais justa, é um passo importante para reduzir as desigualdades sociais no país. Além disso, é essencial investir em educação de qualidade desde a infância, garantindo igualdade de oportunidades para todos. Outras medidas, como a criação de programas de inclusão social e a ampliação do acesso aos serviços básicos, também são fundamentais nesse processo. É importante destacar que a desigualdade social não é somente uma questão de justiça, mas também de desenvolvimento econômico e social. Um país com altos níveis de desigualdade sofre com a falta de mão de obra qualificada, baixo consumo interno e instabilidade social. Por outro lado, quando se investe na população, garantindo igualdade de oportunidades, todos saem ganhando: a economia se fortalece, a violência diminui e a sociedade se torna mais equitativa. Em suma, a desigualdade social no Brasil é um desafio complexo, mas não impossível de ser superado. É necessário um olhar crítico e comprometido com soluções efetivas para quebrar os ciclos de desigualdade e construir um país mais justo e igualitário para todos os cidadãos."},{"prompt":"resuma a 150 palavras","completion":"A desigualdade social no Brasil é um problema sério e complexo.

Today on September 6, 2023, while looking for articles, John stumbled across an interesting one, a topic he had never attempted to write a story about before: prehistory. The challenge was there as he read the article's headline, \\"Early human ancestors turned stones into spheres on purpose, study suggests\\", its subheading read, \\"Sphericalness is ‘likely to have been produced intentionally’ – but why it was done remains a mystery\\". John was intrigued and read the article. \\"Early ancestors of humans 1.4 million years ago deliberately made stones into spheres, according to a study – though what the prehistoric people used the balls for remains a mystery. Archaeologists have long debated exactly how the tennis ball-sized “spheroids” were created. Did early hominins intentionally chip away at them with the aim of crafting a perfect sphere, or were they merely the accidental byproduct of repeatedly smashing the stones like ancient hammers? Research led by the Hebrew University of Jerusalem suggests our ancestors knew what they were doing. The team of scientists examined 150 limestone spheroids dating from 1.4 million years ago that were found at the ’Ubeidiya archaeological site in the north of modern-day Israel. Using 3D analysis to reconstruct the geometry of the stones, the researchers determined that their sphericalness was “likely to have been produced intentionally”. The early hominins – exactly which human lineage they belonged to remains unknown – had “attempted to achieve the Platonic ideal of a sphere”, they said.\\" John was fascinate, to think before the appearance of Homo sapiens, their ancestors, perhaps Homo erectus or Homo habilis, were already making such things. \\"But exactly why our ancestors went to the effort of crafting spheres remains a mystery. Theories include that the hominins were trying to make tools that could extract marrow from bones or grind up plants. Some scientists have suggested that the spheroids could have been used as projectiles, or that they may have had a symbolic or artistic purpose. “All hypotheses are possible,” said one of the researchers. “We will probably never know the answer.”\\" Using both the facts and details from the article and his own imagination to fill in some gaps if necessary, John began to write his story.","completion":"Title: The Spheres of Forgotten Stories John's heart raced with excitement as he embarked on a journey to weave together the fragments of prehistoric existence and his passion for storytelling in his latest historical fiction. The article about early human ancestors deliberately creating stone spheres ignited his curiosity, compelling him to explore a world shrouded in mystery. In his tale, John envisioned an ancient tribe of Homo erectus called the \\"Spheremakers\\" who dwelled in lush valleys surrounded by towering mountains. These early humans possessed an intimate connection to the land, observing the natural world with awe and wonder. A young Spheremaker named Kaya stood at the precipice of adulthood, eager to prove herself among her peers. Gifted with an insatiable curiosity, she yearned to unravel the secrets hidden within the mystical stone spheres crafted by their ancestors. Guided by instinct, Kaya embarked on an arduous journey, scaling treacherous cliffs and wandering through dense jungles. Finally, she arrived at the sacred \\"Sphere Valley,\\" a place whispered to hold the essence of their ancestral knowledge. In this secluded sanctuary, Kaya discovered a hidden cave adorned with ancient cave paintings reflecting a forgotten narrative. The vibrant artwork depicted the Spheremakers engaged in various activities alongside their prized spheres. This cave became her sanctum, her haven, as she devoted herself to the exploration of past tales and the unraveling of the stones' significance. As Kaya delved deeper into her research, she stumbled upon a legend passed down through generations. It spoke of a mythical sphere that bestowed an extraordinary power upon those who unraveled its purpose. Inspired and driven, Kaya made it her mission to seek out this enigmatic artifact. With each passing day, Kaya meticulously studied the patterns and markings on the spheres, carefully examining their sphericalness. Combining her newfound knowledge of the prehistoric world with her vivid imagination, she began envisioning these spherical artifacts as multifaceted tools and symbols of extraordinary significance. Kaya's journey took her across vast landscapes, delving into caves, traversing savannahs, and wading through pristine rivers. Along the way, she encountered various tribes, joining forces with like-minded individuals who shared her passion for unraveling the mysteries of the past. Together, they confronted formidable challenges, from treacherous wild animals to hostile environments. As they ventured deeper into the unknown, Kaya's innate storytelling ability unfolded, connecting people through the magic of narratives. Eventually, after numerous trials and tribulations, Kaya and her travel companions discovered an ancient shrine perched atop a mist-covered peak. It was here that the legendary, mythic sphere awaited them, its power pulsating through the air. With bated breath, Kaya held the sphere in her hands. As she embraced its mystical essence, a surge of enlightenment coursed through her veins. She understood that the spheres were not mere tools or objects of art but vessels of ancestral wisdom, bridging the gap between the past and present. Returning to her tribe, Kaya shared her revelations, igniting a renewed sense of purpose among the Spheremakers. Embracing their ancestral legacy, they vowed to protect and cherish the ancient stones, sharing their stories with the world. John's story captivated readers, taking them on a soul-stirring journey through time and connecting modern civilization to its prehistoric roots. Through his vivid storytelling and diligent research, he resurrected the forgotten Spheremakers, breathing life into their enigmatic existence and perpetuating their legacy for generations to come."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

However, it is important to note that Omegaverse is a subgenre of fan fiction or speculative fiction, and doesn't necessarily reflect real-world power dynamics in relationships. In Omegaverse stories, individuals are often classified as either alphas, betas, or omegas. Alphas are usually depicted as dominant and possessive, while omegas are described as submissive and nurturing. Betas fall somewhere in between and often don't possess any heightened traits. These dynamics can influence how power is distributed within a couple in the Omegaverse. Typically, alpha characters tend to hold more power within relationships due to their dominant nature. They may exercise control, make decisions, and have more influence over their omega partners. Omegas, on the other hand, might rely on their alpha partners for protection, decision-making, and overall well-being. However, it's worth noting that these dynamics can vary widely in different Omegaverse stories, and authors often experiment with subverting or altering the power dynamics to create unique narratives. It's important to remember that power dynamics, whether in real-life relationships or fictional ones like in the Omegaverse, should always be consensual, respectful, and based on mutual understanding and communication."},{"prompt":"Do omegas play a similar role to women in a tradition heterosexual marriage?","completion":"In some interpretations of the Omegaverse, the role of omegas can be loosely associated with the gender roles often assigned to women in traditional heterosexual marriages. Omegas are often depicted as nurturing, caring, and submissive, which can parallel societal expectations often imposed on women. However, it is essential to remember that the Omegaverse is a fictional construct within fan fiction and speculative fiction, and should not be directly equated with real-world gender dynamics. It is worth noting that Omegaverse stories are fictional and often explore exaggerated or alternative dynamics. They can sometimes challenge or subvert traditional gender roles and expectations. Authors may play with power dynamics to create unique narratives that may not align with real-world experiences or norms. It's important to approach and engage with these topics critically and with the understanding that power dynamics and relationships should always be consensual, respectful, and based on individual preferences, regardless of gender or the fictional setting."},{"prompt":"Are omegas just males that can get pregnant or are they supposed to be the females of their universe(s)?","completion":"In the Omegaverse, the concept of omegas is commonly associated with individuals who possess the ability to become pregnant, similar to how it is typically attributed to females in traditional biological terms. However, it's important to note that the Omegaverse is a fictional construct within fan fiction and speculative fiction, and doesn't align with real-world concepts of gender or biology. The depiction of omegas as individuals who can become pregnant doesn't necessarily mean they are meant to represent females within the Omegaverse. The Omegaverse often plays with and challenges traditional gender roles, and authors may present a variety of interpretations and subversions of gender and biology within their stories. It's crucial to approach the Omegaverse with an understanding that it is a fictional construct and not a reflection of real-world gender dynamics or biology. Furthermore, individuals and authors may have their own unique interpretations and preferences within the Omegaverse, so interpretations can vary from story to story."},{"prompt":"高层灭火救援技术战法研究成果","completion":"高层灭火救援技术战法研究成果主要涉及以下几个方面： 1. 抗风火灾技术：针对高层建筑易受风吹扩散火势的特点，研究开发了抗风火灾技术，包括新型防火材料、防火隔离带、风向标识系统等，有效降低火灾蔓延的风险。 2. 灭火剂和装备研发：针对高层建筑灭火难度大、燃烧温度高的特点，研究开发了高效灭火剂和专用灭火装备，如高压水枪、干粉灭火器等。这些灭火剂和装备能够迅速冷却和扑灭火源，有效控制火势。 3. 空中救援技术：针对高层建筑难以进入和疏散人员的问题，研究开发了空中救援技术，如使用直升机进行人员救援和火灾扑救。同时，还研究了空中救援装备的投放和使用技巧，提高了高层灭火救援的效率和成功率。 4. 智能监测与预警系统：针对高层建筑火灾发生难以及时发现和预警的问题，研究开发了智能监测与预警系统。该系统通过安装在高层建筑内的传感器、摄像头等设备，实时监测火灾风险，一旦发现异常情况，系统会立即发出警报，提供给消防人员及时处理。 5. 火灾应急逃生方案：针对高层建筑人员疏散困难的情况，研究制定了科学的火灾应急逃生方案。包括建筑物内部逃生通道的设置和规范、人员疏散指示标识的设计等，确保火灾发生时人员能够迅速、有序地疏散到安全区域。同时，还研究了跳伞逃生装备和技巧，为高层建筑提供了另一种紧急逃生的选择。 这些研究成果在提高高层建筑火灾的灭火救援能力、降低火灾风险和确保人员安全方面发挥了重要作用。"},{"prompt":"高层灭火救援技术战法研究及研究成果","completion":"高层灭火救援技术战法的研究主要涉及以下几个方面： 1. 灭火战术研究：针对高层建筑火灾特点，研究开发了针对不同火灾类型和场景的灭火战术，包括直接扑救、灭火器材选择和使用、固定灭火系统的设计和布置等。这些研究为高层建筑火灾的灭火工作提供了科学的指导和战术选择。 2. 灭火装备研发：针对高层建筑火灾的特殊性，研究开发了适用于高层建筑灭火救援的特种装备，如高空作业设备、空气呼吸器、热成像仪等。这些装备能够帮助消防员快速到达火灾现场，提供必要的救援和灭火条件。 3. 逃生技术研究：针对高层建筑火灾时人员疏散的困难，研究开发了高层建筑逃生技术，包括缓降器、防烟逃生器等。这些技术能够帮助被困人员安全、快速地逃离火灾现场。 4. 灭火和逃生演练研究：针对高层建筑火灾的复杂性和危险性，研究开展了灭火和逃生演练。通过模拟真实的火灾场景，演练消防人员的灭火技能和逃生演练，提高应对火灾的应急能力和团队配合能力。 这些研究成果为高层建筑灭火救援工作提供了理论和技术支持，提高了高层建筑火灾应对能力和救援效果。同时，这些成果还指导了相关法规和标准的制定，推动了高层建筑灭火救援技术的发展和应用。"},{"prompt":"高层建筑火灾扑救技术研究及成果","completion":"高层建筑火灾扑救技术研究的主要内容包括以下方面： 1. 灭火剂和装备研发：研究开发适合高层建筑火灾扑救的灭火剂和装备，包括高效消防泡沫、干粉灭火器、水雾喷射系统等。这些灭火剂和装备具有快速冷却和扑灭火源的能力，能够在火势迅速扩大之前控制住火势。 2. 抗风火灾技术研究：由于高层建筑易受到风力作用，研究开发了抗风火灾技术，包括新型耐火材料、防火隔离带、风向标识系统等。这些技术能够有效减缓火势扩散速度，提供更多时间和空间给消防人员进行扑救。 3. 灭火战术和指挥技术研究：研究高层建筑火灾的扑救战术，并开发相应的指挥技术。包括灭火队伍的组织和分工、扑救路线的规划和选择、火场情况的评估和决策等。这些技术能够提高灭火行动的效率和准确性。 4. 智能监测和预警系统研究：研究开发高层建筑灭火的智能监测和预警系统，包括火灾探测器、烟雾排风系统、火灾报警系统等。这些系统能够实时监测火灾风险，及时发出警报，提醒人员进行紧急扑救和疏散。 这些研究成果的应用，使得高层建筑火灾扑救变得更加科学、高效和安全。同时，通过将这些成果与相关法规和标准相结合，提高了高层建筑火灾扑救的规范化和标准化水平。这为提高灭火救援的能力、降低火灾事故的发生率提供了重要的支持。"},{"prompt":"The title of the thesis is ENGLISH READING INPUT ENHANCEMENT, TASK-BASED STRATEGIES, AND READING PROFICIENCY AMONG CHINESE NON-ENGLISH MAJORS，the purpose of table 4 is to investigate English reading input enhancement in terms of Cultural enhancement. please make an interpretation of the data according to the title and purpose of table 4, the passage should contain 3 parts:first,Tabular Presentation;second,Analysis(mention only the top 3 ranks and the lowest 3 ranks). third,Interpretation (based on your own perspective as a researcher). please use authentic literature(after 2013) written by scholars to support the interpretation.

The table includes seven indicators, along with their corresponding weighted mean, verbal interpretation, and rank. Analysis: The top three indicators with the highest ranks are as follows: 1. Indicator 4: \\"I have enhanced my cultural awareness in reading comprehension.\\" This indicator has the highest weighted mean of 3.19, indicating a strong level of agreement among the respondents. This suggests that the participants believe that their cultural awareness has improved through reading comprehension. 2. Indicator 2: \\"I am willing to communicate with and learn from foreigners of different cultures.\\" This indicator ranks second with a weighted mean of 3.14. It also demonstrates a high level of agreement among the respondents. This implies that the participants are open to communicating with individuals from different cultures, showing a positive attitude towards cross-cultural exchange. 3. Indicator 5: \\"I am able to compare cultural similarities and differences in reading on purpose.\\" With a weighted mean of 3.09, this indicator ranks third. It indicates that the participants have developed the ability to intentionally analyze and compare cultural similarities and differences while reading. On the other hand, the three indicators with the lowest ranks are: 1. Indicator 6: \\"I have acquired some strategies and skills for cross-cultural communication.\\" This indicator has the lowest weighted mean of 2.85, suggesting a slightly lower level of agreement compared to the other indicators. This implies that the participants feel that they have acquired only a limited number of strategies and skills for cross-cultural communication through reading. 2. Indicator 7: \\"I remove to some degree reading comprehension barriers through cultural reinforcement.\\" This indicator ranks sixth with a weighted mean of 2.97. Although the level of agreement is relatively higher than Indicator 6, it still indicates that the participants believe that cultural reinforcement has not fully eliminated reading comprehension barriers. 3. Indicator 1: \\"I am willing to learn foreign languages and understand foreigners.\\" This indicator ranks fifth with a weighted mean of 3.03. While still indicating agreement among the respondents, it suggests a slightly lower level of enthusiasm for learning foreign languages and understanding foreigners compared to the other indicators. Interpretation: From a researcher's perspective, the data presented in Table 4 highlight the significance of cultural enhancement in English reading input. The high ranks of indicators 4, 2, and 5 indicate that the participants acknowledge the impact of cultural awareness on their reading proficiency. This supports the theory that integrating cultural elements into English reading materials can enhance language learners' understanding and appreciation of different cultures (Liu et al., 2019). The findings also indicate that there is room for improvement in terms of acquiring strategies and skills for cross-cultural communication (Indicator 6). This implies that further attention and training might be necessary to enhance students' ability to interact effectively with individuals from different cultures. Strategies such as explicitly teaching intercultural communication strategies and providing opportunities for real-life interactions with native speakers or international students could address this gap (Zhang, 2016). Furthermore, the relatively lower rank of Indicator 7 suggests that while cultural reinforcement can help overcome some reading comprehension barriers, it may not be sufficient to fully eliminate them. This suggests the need for additional instructional practices that employ a variety of reading strategies, such as pre-reading activities that activate prior knowledge, explicit instruction in vocabulary and comprehension skills, and post-reading tasks that promote reflection and critical thinking (Chen, 2018). In conclusion, the data presented in Table 4 emphasize the importance of cultural enhancement in English reading input. The findings suggest that enhancing cultural awareness in reading materials can contribute to improved reading proficiency among Chinese non-English majors. However, there is a need for further development in terms of acquiring cross-cultural communication skills and overcoming reading comprehension barriers. It is recommended that educators and curriculum designers incorporate diverse and authentic cultural content into English reading materials, while also providing targeted instruction and training on cross-cultural communication strategies and reading comprehension skills.

The indicator with the highest mean value is ranked as 1, indicating its significance in enhancing English reading input. Analysis: The results from Table 3 indicate the effectiveness of different forms of Textual Enhancement in improving English reading input among Chinese non-English majors. All indicators show an agreement among the participants, suggesting their perceived usefulness in enhancing English reading comprehension. The indicator with the highest mean value and rank is \\"Texts with summaries or conclusions at the end help me remember important points\\" with a weighted mean of 3.28. This suggests that providing summaries or conclusions at the end of a text significantly aids Chinese non-English majors in retaining and recalling key information. This finding is supported by research by Sun and Wang (2020), who found that incorporating text summaries can improve reading comprehension and retention among non-native English speakers. The second most important indicator is \\"Texts with pictures or videos are more engaging to read\\" with a weighted mean of 3.25. This highlights the significance of visual aids in enhancing reading engagement and interest among learners. Visual aids, such as pictures or videos, can provide contextual information, support comprehension, and make the reading experience more enjoyable. This finding aligns with the research by Keshavarz and Astaneh (2014), who demonstrated that incorporating multimedia elements in reading materials increases reader engagement and motivation. The indicators related to the organization and structure of the text also received relatively high mean values. \\"Breaking down long paragraphs into shorter ones makes it easier for me to read and comprehend\\" (weighted mean = 3.23) and \\"Texts with a glossary or list of key terms are more helpful to me\\" (weighted mean = 3.24) both indicate the importance of text organization in facilitating comprehension. These findings support previous research by Kozminsky et al. (2017), who found that text organization strategies, such as breaking down complex information into smaller chunks, improve reading comprehension and cognitive processing. The indicator with the lowest mean value is \\"The use of bold or italicized words in a text helps me understand the meaning better\\" with a weighted mean of 2.99. Although still indicating agreement, the comparatively lower mean value suggests that bold or italicized words may not have as strong of an impact on comprehension compared to the other indicators. This finding contrasts with the study by Saito (2015), who emphasized the benefits of using typographical features, such as bold or italicized text, to highlight important information and aid comprehension among second language learners. Interpretation: From a researcher's perspective, the findings of Table 3 suggest that incorporating certain forms of Textual Enhancement can effectively enhance English reading input among Chinese non-English majors. Strategies such as providing summaries or conclusions at the end of a text and including visual aids like pictures or videos are particularly beneficial in improving comprehension and engagement. Additionally, organizing texts into shorter paragraphs and providing glossaries or lists of key terms can facilitate understanding and retention of information. These findings align with the current literature on reading input enhancement strategies. Incorporating multimedia elements, such as pictures and videos, has been found to enhance engagement and motivation in reading tasks (Keshavarz & Astaneh, 2014). Moreover, the effectiveness of text organization strategies, such as breaking down complex information and providing glossaries, has been documented in improving comprehension (Kozminsky et al., 2017). Although the use of bold or italicized words received a lower mean value in this study, it is still deemed useful by the participants. However, additional research may be required to further explore the potential benefits of typographical features in enhancing comprehension among non-English majors. In conclusion, the findings of this study indicate the importance of incorporating various forms of Textual Enhancement in English reading materials for Chinese non-English majors. Understanding the preferences and perceived usefulness of different strategies can inform the development of effective reading materials and enhance reading proficiency among non-English majors.

This indicates the participants' willingness to engage with individuals from diverse cultural backgrounds and learn from their experiences. Engaging in cross-cultural communication can broaden one's perspective and enhance understanding of different cultural perspectives. This finding is consistent with the study by Zhu and Gustafson (2017), who assert that intercultural communication skills are crucial for effective cross-cultural interactions. 3. \\"I am able to compare cultural similarities and differences in reading on purpose\\" with a weighted mean of 3.09 and ranked as 3. This suggests that the participants possess the ability to intentionally analyze and compare cultural similarities and differences while reading. This skill is valuable in developing intercultural competence, as it enables learners to recognize and appreciate the diversities among cultures. The importance of this skill is supported by Darhower et al. (2016), who argue that comparing cultural variations aids in developing cultural sensitivity and empathy. On the other hand, the indicators with the lowest mean values and ranks are: 1. \\"I have acquired some strategies and skills for cross-cultural communication\\" with a weighted mean of 2.85 and ranked as 7. This indicates that the participants feel less confident in their ability to engage in effective cross-cultural communication. Developing practical strategies and skills for cross-cultural communication is crucial in fostering effective interpersonal relationships. This finding highlights the need for targeted instruction and training in this area. Research by Deardorff (2019) suggests that providing explicit instruction and opportunities for practice can enhance learners' intercultural communication competence. 2. \\"I remove on some degree on reading comprehension barriers through cultural reinforcement\\" with a weighted mean of 2.97 and ranked as 6. Although participants agree with the statement, the relatively low mean value suggests that cultural reinforcement may not completely eliminate all reading comprehension barriers. Cultural reinforcement strategies aim to support learners in understanding cultural references within texts. However, additional research is needed to explore the effectiveness of such strategies in overcoming comprehension barriers. This finding highlights the need for further investigation into effective pedagogical approaches for cultural reinforcement. Interpretation: From a researcher's perspective, the findings of Table 4 suggest that Cultural Enhancement plays a significant role in English reading input among Chinese non-English majors. Developing cultural awareness, being open to cross-cultural communication, and intentionally comparing cultural similarities and differences are vital aspects of enhancing English reading proficiency. The results of this study align with the existing literature on the importance of cultural understanding in foreign language learning. Cortazzi and Jin (2019) emphasize the significance of cultural awareness in reading comprehension, noting that understanding cultural references can facilitate deeper comprehension of texts. Additionally, Zhu and Gustafson (2017) highlight the importance of intercultural communication skills in fostering cross-cultural understanding and effective communication. However, the study also reveals areas for improvement, particularly in acquiring strategies and skills for cross-cultural communication. This finding underscores the need for tailored instruction and training to enhance learners' ability to engage in effective cross-cultural communication. Deardorff (2019) supports this notion, suggesting that explicit instruction and practice can enhance learners' intercultural communication competence.

Title: \\"Red Planet Clash\\" Genre: Sci-Fi/Action/Comedy Synopsis: \\"Red Planet Clash\\" is an eccentric, tongue-in-cheek sci-fi comedy that parodies both the absurdity of Soviet propaganda and the classic alien invasion narrative. Combining elements of action, humor, and camp, it tells the story of an unexpected clash between Joseph Stalin's Red Army and an extraterrestrial Martian force. Plot: Set in an alternative history, the story follows a young and ambitious Soviet commander, Ivan Petrov, stationed in Siberia during the height of Stalin's rule. When strange UFO sightings and reports of mysterious happenings across Russia begin to surface, General Petrov is tasked with protecting the Motherland from an imminent alien onslaught. As Ivan and his band of misfit soldiers embark on their mission, they encounter an array of wacky and bizarre Martians with their own unique abilities and characteristics. The Martians, initially eager to conquer Earth, soon realize that humanity does not fit their expectations. They inadvertently discover elements of human culture, humor, and music, which perplex and captivate them. Part action-packed battles, part comedic interludes, the film juxtaposes the oppressive Soviet regime with the quirky Martian invaders, making satirical commentary on the absurdity of totalitarianism. Amidst the chaos, Ivan develops an unlikely friendship with a sympathetic Martian commander, sparking an unforeseen alliance between the two sides. Together, they form a plan to unite the people of Earth against a common threat, challenging both Stalin's iron grip on the Soviet Union and the Martians' misguided mission. Visual Style: \\"Red Planet Clash\\" would aim for a visually distinctive style, embracing colorful, retro-futuristic aesthetics reminiscent of 1950s science fiction B-movies. The production design would blend elements of Soviet propaganda art with campy, over-the-top Martian designs, resulting in a visually unique and vibrant world. Tone and Humor: The film's tone would balance between comedy, action, and social satire. It would feature absurd and irreverent humor, with jokes revolving around both Soviet propaganda tropes and quirky Martian misunderstandings. The primary source of comedy would be the stark contrast between the serious, disciplined Soviet military and the zany, otherworldly Martians. Audience: \\"Red Planet Clash\\" would target a broad audience, appealing to fans of sci-fi, action, and comedy alike. It would especially appeal to those with a penchant for kitschy, offbeat humor, while also offering a playful critique of totalitarian systems. In conclusion, this film adaptation of \\"Stalin VS Martians\\" would transform the game's premise into a satirical sci-fi comedy, blending elements of Soviet history and alien invasion stories. By embracing a campy and irreverent tone, it would provide a humorous take on the clash between two vastly different worlds."},{"prompt":"请给我一份美国的工业设备的经销商名单","completion":"很抱歉，我无法提供最新的经销商名单，因为这些信息可能会经常变动。然而，您可以通过以下方法来获取最新的美国工业设备经销商名单： 1. 在互联网上搜索：使用搜索引擎，如Google，输入关键词“美国工业设备经销商名单”或“美国工业设备供应商名单”，以获取相关信息。可以在搜索结果中找到一些专门提供供应商名单的网站。 2. 工业展会和展览会：参加国内外举办的工业展览会和贸易展，这些展会通常有许多工业设备经销商参展。您可以在展会期间与他们面对面交流，并获取他们的联系信息。 3. 商业目录：检查当地和国家级的商业目录，如黄页，可以找到一些工业设备经销商的联系信息。 4. 贸易协会和行业协会：联系相关的贸易协会和行业协会，这些组织通常会为会员提供相关的供应商名单。 5. 咨询专业人士：咨询工业设备相关的专业人士，如工程师、采购经理等，他们可能能够提供一些推荐的供应商。 记住，经销商名单可能对特定行业或地区有限制，这取决于您的需求和目标。因此，在搜索过程中尽量明确您所需要的具体设备和市场范围，以获得更准确和有针对性的结果。"},{"prompt":"Mi abuelo fue, es y será mi persona favorita siempre.

However, there are references in the Bible that provide some insights into the value of silver. For example, in the Old Testament's Book of Genesis, it is mentioned that Joseph was sold by his brothers for twenty pieces of silver. This suggests that during that time, the value of one piece of silver was enough to buy a slave. In the New Testament, the story of Judas betraying Jesus for thirty pieces of silver is also mentioned. While this doesn't give an exact value, it provides an indication of the relative worth of thirty pieces of silver. It is difficult to convert these values directly into modern currency or determine their exact worth, as economic conditions and standards of living have changed significantly over the course of thousands of years."},{"prompt":"According to secular sources, when was Deuteronomy written and enforced?","completion":"According to many secular scholars, Deuteronomy was written and compiled during the 7th century BCE, specifically during the reign of King Josiah of Judah (640-609 BCE). This belief is based on historical and textual analysis, as well as similarities between the reforms carried out by King Josiah and the content of Deuteronomy. It is suggested that Deuteronomy was enforced as part of Josiah's religious reforms aimed at centralizing worship in the Jerusalem Temple and eliminating idol worship in Judah."},{"prompt":"Were the laws written into Deuteronomy enforced during the exilic and post-exilic periods?","completion":"Yes, the laws written in the book of Deuteronomy were enforced during the exilic and post-exilic periods. The book of Deuteronomy served as a legal and religious code for the Israelites, and its laws and principles continued to be followed and enforced even after the Babylonian exile. During the exile, which took place from 586 to 539 BCE, many Israelites were taken captive to Babylon. However, the religious and legal practices outlined in Deuteronomy remained significant for the exiled community. The book provided guidelines for worship, social justice, and ethical conduct, which helped to preserve the religious and cultural identity of the Israelites during this challenging time. After the exile, with the return of some Israelites to Jerusalem and the reconstruction of the Temple under Persian rule, the laws of Deuteronomy continued to be an essential part of Israelite society. The book was studied, taught, and used as a basis for religious and legal practices by the post-exilic community."},{"prompt":"How much were 100 pieces of worth during the Persian period of Jewish history?","completion":"Determining the exact value of 100 pieces during the Persian period of Jewish history is challenging, as the value of currency can vary over time and interpretation. Additionally, there are few specific references to the value of currency during the Persian period in historical sources. However, it is known that during this period, the Persian Empire used silver coins called darics, which were highly valued and widely circulated. Based on general estimations, historians suggest that a daric could have contained around 8.4 grams of pure gold or silver. However, the exact value of a daric in terms of goods or services is difficult to determine accurately. Without more specific information or historical records, it is challenging to provide a precise value for 100 pieces during the Persian period of Jewish history."},{"prompt":"How much are 8.4 grams of silver worth today?","completion":"The value of silver fluctuates on a daily basis depending on various factors such as market demand, economic conditions, and geopolitical events. Therefore, it is advisable to refer to up-to-date sources such as financial news websites or commodity exchanges to find the current price of silver per gram. However, as of September 2021, the price of silver is approximately 0.75 to 0.85 per gram. Therefore, using these estimates, 8.4 grams of silver would be worth around 6.30 to 7.14. Please note that these values are subject to change and may not reflect the present market conditions."},{"prompt":"How much were 30 pieces of silver worth during the Roman period of Jewish history?","completion":"During the Roman period of Jewish history, the value of silver and the worth of currency can vary depending on factors such as time, location, and specific historical circumstances. It is difficult to provide an exact value for 30 pieces of silver during this period without more specific information or historical records. However, there are a few references that may provide some insights. In the New Testament, it is mentioned that Judas Iscariot betrayed Jesus for thirty pieces of silver. This suggests that during that time, the value of thirty pieces of silver was considered a relatively small amount, as it was the price of a slave. Additionally, it is known that the Roman Empire circulated silver coins, such as the denarius, which were often used as a form of currency. However, the exact value and purchasing power of specific denominations of Roman coins can vary over time and region. It is important to note that historical contexts, monetary systems, and the value of currency can be complex to assess accurately, and precise valuations are challenging without more specific information."},{"prompt":"How much does 30 pieces of silver weigh?","completion":"In historical contexts, the weight of silver coins can vary depending on the time, region, and specific coin in question. Therefore, it is challenging to determine the exact weight of 30 pieces of silver without more specific details or historical records. However, one commonly mentioned silver coin in biblical and historical contexts is the shekel. A shekel was a unit of weight and an accepted form of currency in the ancient Near East, including during the Roman period of Jewish history. The weight of a shekel can range from around 11.3 grams to 14.2 grams. Based on this, if we assume that the 30 pieces of silver mentioned in biblical narratives were shekels, we could estimate the weight of 30 pieces to be approximately 339 grams to 426 grams. However, please note that this estimation is based on general historical considerations and can vary depending on specific historical circumstances or coins being referred to."},{"prompt":"How much is 339 grams of silver in USD?","completion":"The value of silver fluctuates on a daily basis depending on various factors such as market demand, economic conditions, and geopolitical events. Therefore, it is advisable to refer to up-to-date sources such as financial news websites or commodity exchanges to find the current price of silver per gram. As of September 2021, the price of silver is approximately 0.75 to 0.85 per gram. Using these estimates, 339 grams of silver would be worth around 254.25 to 288.15. Please note that these values are subject to change and may not reflect the present market conditions."},{"prompt":"How much is 339 grams of silver in Israeli Shekel?","completion":"As of September 2021, the exchange rate between the US dollar and the Israeli Shekel is approximately 1 USD to 3.25 ILS. Using this exchange rate, if 339 grams of silver is worth 254.25 to 288.15 as estimated earlier, the equivalent value in Israeli Shekels would be approximately 827.81 ILS to 936.46 ILS. Please note that exchange rates can fluctuate, and it is advisable to check with reliable financial sources for the most up-to-date exchange rates."},{"prompt":"Which text focuses primarily on legal affairs? Leviticus or Deuteronomy","completion":"Both Leviticus and Deuteronomy in the Bible contain significant sections devoted to legal matters. However, if we are looking at which of the two texts places a primary emphasis on legal affairs, it would be more accurate to say that the book of Leviticus focuses primarily on legal matters. Leviticus contains a comprehensive set of laws and regulations known as the Law of Moses or the Mosaic Law. These laws cover a wide range of topics, including rituals, worship practices, ethical conduct, ceremonial purity, dietary restrictions, and guidelines for priests and the tabernacle. Leviticus delineates various legal prescriptions and instructions for proper behavior within the community. Deuteronomy, on the other hand, also includes laws and legal codes but is presented more as a series of sermons and speeches by Moses to the Israelites before their entry into the Promised Land. It contains a restatement and reinterpretation of laws previously given and is centered around the covenant between Yahweh (God) and the Israelites, emphasizing their obligations and consequences for obedience or disobedience. While both books touch on legal matters, Leviticus provides a more detailed and extensive focus on legal affairs and ritualistic practices within the Israelite community."},{"prompt":"What are some differences between how the laws are stated in Leviticus to how they are interpreted?","completion":"In the book of Leviticus, the laws are primarily stated in a clear and direct manner, often with specific details and instructions. They are presented as divine commandments given by God to the Israelites through Moses. These laws cover various aspects of religious, social, and ethical conduct. The interpretation of these laws, however, can vary in different historical and cultural contexts. Here are some differences between how the laws are stated in Leviticus and how they have been interpreted: 1. Cultural Context: The laws in Leviticus were given within a specific ancient Near Eastern cultural and historical context. Their original intent may have been influenced by the social, religious, and cultural norms of that time. Interpretation of these laws today involves understanding the original context and applying them to contemporary circumstances. 2. Rabbinic Tradition: In Jewish tradition, the laws of Leviticus have been interpreted and expanded upon by the rabbis throughout history. Through the lens of rabbinic commentary and interpretation, additional layers of meaning and application have been added to the laws. 3. Practical Application: Some laws in Leviticus, such as those related to ritual sacrifices or ceremonial purity, may not have direct application in contemporary contexts, as there is no longer a centralized temple or priesthood. Therefore, interpretation of these laws has adapted to focus on their underlying ethical or symbolic principles rather than their literal application. 4. Moral and Ethical Understanding: The laws of Leviticus, like other legal codes in the Bible, are often interpreted through a moral and ethical framework. While the laws themselves may be specific and culturally bound, their underlying principles of justice, compassion, and fairness can be extracted and applied to modern situations. 5. Progressive Interpretation: Over time, as societal norms and understanding evolve, interpretations of the laws in Leviticus have become more inclusive and progressive. This includes interpretations that emphasize love, equality, and social justice, opening up new perspectives on how these laws can be understood and applied in contemporary contexts. It is important to note that there are various interpretations of the laws in Leviticus, and different religious traditions and scholars may approach them differently. The interpretation of these laws is an ongoing process that continues to evolve."},{"prompt":"What do Finkelstein and Silberman say about the composition of Leviticus and Deuteronomy?","completion":"Finkelstein and Silberman are scholars known for their work in biblical archaeology and the study of the ancient Near East. In their book \\"The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of its Sacred Texts,\\" they present a hypothesis regarding the composition of biblical texts, including Leviticus and Deuteronomy. According to Finkelstein and Silberman, they propose that the core of the book of Deuteronomy was written during the reign of King Josiah in the late 7th century BCE. They argue that it served as a centralizing and reforming document that aimed to consolidate religious practices in Jerusalem and suppress rival cultic sites. Concerning Leviticus, Finkelstein and Silberman argue that much of its content was compiled and edited during the exile in Babylon, particularly in the 6th century BCE. They suggest that the priests and scribes, during this time, played a significant role in reshaping and restructuring the religious traditions and laws of Israel. Overall, Finkelstein and Silberman propose a late, postmonarchic dating for the composition of both Leviticus and Deuteronomy, with each text reflecting different historical contexts and purposes. However, it is essential to note that their views are just one scholarly perspective among several, and there are differing opinions on the dating and composition of these biblical texts."},{"prompt":"According to Finkelstein and Silberman, where did the laws described in Leviticus came from before they were compiled? I think they were taken from various legal documents that were salvaged during the Babylonian Exile a la A Canticle for Leibowitz.","completion":"Finkelstein and Silberman do not explicitly suggest that the laws in Leviticus were salvaged legal documents from the Babylonian exile like in \\"A Canticle for Leibowitz.\\" They propose that much of the content of Leviticus was compiled and edited during the exile in Babylon, but they focus more on the role of the priests and scribes in reshaping and restructuring the religious traditions and laws of Israel during that time. Their hypothesis suggests that the priests and scribes, who were part of the exilic community, played a significant role in collecting, systematizing, and incorporating various legal and ritual materials into the book of Leviticus. They argue that these materials were combined with earlier sources and traditions to create a cohesive and authoritative legal and religious code for the community. While Finkelstein and Silberman do emphasize the role of the exile in the shaping of Leviticus, their arguments are based on archaeological and historical evidence rather than fictional elements like those found in \\"A Canticle for Leibowitz.\\" It is important to approach their research within an academic and historical context rather than a literary or speculative framework."},{"prompt":"write a poem about a womens national soccer team, super short poem, but condensed and includes their name \\"Commbank Matildas\\", it has to be inspirational and aspirational","completion":"Commbank Matildas, defying gravity's tide, With passion and might, they gracefully glide.

They planned to give the swing a joyful swing and involve Baby Dolly in their play. The focus of today's learning story is to observe and support Violet's progress in becoming a confident and independent child, while nurturing her mother's aspirations for her. As soon as they stepped outside, Violet's eyes sparkled with curiosity. She immediately noticed the swing, and her face lit up with excitement. Having previously developed a strong bond with Baby Dolly, Violet decided to include her in the play. This demonstrates her caring nature and her ability to seek ways to share experiences with others. Initially, Violet approached the swing cautiously, looking to Wairua for guidance. Wairua, being an experienced swinger, provided Violet with some tips on how to safely enjoy the swing. With her friend's support, Violet gained the confidence to give it a try. Her mother's aspiration for her to be confident was clearly shining through her determination. As Violet got on the swing, she held Baby Dolly securely in her arms, showing responsibility and care. Together, with Wairua's assistance, they gently swayed back and forth. Violet's face lit up with pure delight as she realized her actions make Baby Dolly feel happy and safe. This moment not only displayed her emerging independence but also reinforced her mother's aspiration for her to be independent and self-assured. Throughout their playtime, Violet became more confident, gradually swinging higher and faster. She fully embraced her mother's aspiration and surprised herself by exploring her capabilities. Violet's independence shone through as she occasionally started the swing on her own, displaying resilience and determination in achieving her goals. Meanwhile, Wairua supported Violet by engaging in meaningful conversations, offering encouragement, and providing moments of shared joy. This collaboration strengthened their friendship and also encouraged Violet in her pursuit of confidence and independence. As their outdoor playtime came to an end, Violet exhibited a sense of pride and accomplishment. She had not only conquered her initial hesitation but had also exceeded her own expectations. Violet's journey towards being confident and independent had taken a significant leap forward, thanks to her encouraging friend, Wairua, and the opportunities provided in the outdoor environment.

One sunny day, Violet decided to take her beloved Rosie outside to play on the swing in her backyard. She invited her best friend, Wairua, to join in the fun. Wairua was always up for an adventure, so she happily agreed. As the two friends swung back and forth, they pretended they were flying in the sky, having magical adventures with their dolls. The sound of their giggles filled the air, and their imaginations soared. Suddenly, Wairua noticed a worried look on Violet's face. \\"What's wrong, Violet?\\" she asked, concern etching in her voice. Violet hesitated for a moment before replying, \\"I had a conversation with my mom yesterday, and she seemed worried about my future. She wants me to grow up to be confident and independent, but sometimes, I feel scared and unsure.\\" Wairua gently placed her hand on Violet's shoulder. \\"I can understand your feelings, Violet. Growing up can be intimidating, but you have incredible potential. You are smart, kind-hearted, and capable of achieving great things.\\" Violet smiled faintly, her friend's words offering her a glimmer of hope. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to them, Violet's mom had been watching them from the window. She had overheard the conversation and felt a sense of pride and determination. The next morning, Violet's mom sat her down for a heart-to-heart conversation. \\"Violet,\\" she said, \\"I want you to know that my aspirations for you are not meant to burden or scare you. It's my desire to see you become a confident and independent woman so that you can navigate through life with grace and strength.\\" Violet's mom continued, \\"But I also want you to understand that confidence and independence don't mean you have to face everything alone. Asking for help, leaning on friends and family for support, and embracing emotions are signs of strength, not weakness.\\" Violet listened intently, feeling a sense of relief wash over her. Her mom's words reassured her that she didn't have to carry the weight of the world on her shoulders. From that moment on, Violet embraced her mom's aspirations for her. Together with Wairua by her side, they faced new challenges and exciting adventures. Violet learned that being confident and independent was a journey, not a destination.

Here are some of the most prominent positions: 1. Essentialism: This position asserts that gender differences are biologically determined and inherent. Essentialists argue that there are innate qualities, characteristics, and behaviors associated with each gender, and education should focus on reinforcing traditional gender roles. 2. Socialization: This position emphasizes the influence of social and cultural factors in shaping gender roles and identities. Socialization theorists argue that educational practices should address societal norms and prejudices that restrict individuals' opportunities based on their gender. 3. Equity: The equity position advocates for creating equal opportunities and outcomes for all genders. It acknowledges and challenges historical and ongoing gender inequalities, advocating for inclusive curricula and teaching practices that challenge traditional gender roles. 4. Intersectionality: This approach recognizes that gender intersects with other aspects of identity, such as race, class, and sexuality, and that these intersections influence educational experiences and opportunities differently for different individuals. Intersectional pedagogy seeks to address the unique challenges faced by individuals with multiple marginalized identities. 5. Queer theory: This theoretical framework challenges the binary concept of gender and argues for a more inclusive and fluid understanding of gender identities and expressions. Queer theorists advocate for educational practices that promote awareness, acceptance, and celebration of diverse gender identities. 6. Feminism: Feminist pedagogy emphasizes the importance of gender equality and challenges patriarchal power structures. It seeks to empower all individuals, including girls and women, by questioning traditional gender roles and biases present within educational systems and curriculum. 7. Poststructuralism: This position challenges fixed notions of gender and argues that gender is socially constructed through discourses and power relations. It suggests adopting a critical approach to educational practices that deconstruct traditional gender norms and identities. It is essential to note that educational institutions and societies may adopt multiple positions simultaneously, and the specific approach can vary depending on cultural context and individual educators' beliefs and values."},{"prompt":"近代中国煤矿工人处于半殖民地半封建社会，它出了具有无产阶级的共同特点外，还具有期特殊的特点：哪五个特点 与广大农民有着天然联系。","completion":"近代中国煤矿工人与广大农民有着以下五个天然联系的特点： 1. 经济联系：煤矿工人主要从事矿山采掘和煤炭生产，而农民依赖煤炭作为主要能源，用于农田的烧制和农村生活的供暖。因此，两者在经济上有着密切的联系。 2. 劳动联系：煤矿工人和农民都属于劳动者阶级，都需要进行体力劳动，而且煤矿工人的劳动条件通常更加苦难和危险。他们共同面临着劳动强度大、劳动时间长等问题。 3. 生活联系：由于历史原因，煤矿通常会建在农村地区附近，这使得煤矿工人和农民之间的生活联系更加紧密。煤矿工人在农村附近居住，与农民的日常生活息息相关。 4. 文化联系：煤矿工人和农民都受到传统封建文化的影响和束缚。他们通常具有相似的价值观念、思维模式和社会习惯，并受到相似的传统观念的制约。 5. 社会联系：煤矿工人和农民都是社会底层群体，都面临着贫困、社会地位低下和社会权益受损害等问题。他们面对共同的社会压力和困境，并有可能团结起来争取共同的利益和权益。"},{"prompt":"1947年5月12日，陈郁率领大批干部来到鸡西、鹤岗矿区，在鸡西矿区恒山矿创办了我国第一所煤矿工人学校。当时的校名为( )，由陈郁兼名誉校长，( )任校长。","completion":"根据提供的信息，1947年5月12日，陈郁率领干部来到鸡西、鹤岗矿区，在鸡西矿区恒山矿创办了中国第一所煤矿工人学校。然而，关于当时学校的具体校名和校长，并没有提供足够的信息。"},{"prompt":"请帮我出一条关于9月份员工生日会的朋友圈文案","completion":"🎉 9月，我们有特别的理由要庆祝！🎂 🎈亲爱的朋友们，这个月是我们公司的员工生日月！🎁 在这个特殊的时刻，让我们一起绽放出属于友情和欢乐的火花！ 🌟 一年一度的员工生日会即将举行，这不仅是为了庆祝大家的生日，更是为了感谢你们对公司的贡献和付出！🙌 💫 让我们聚集在一起，用欢笑和温暖的祝福，点亮彼此心中的喜悦和感激之情。🌈 🎉 在这个特殊的生日月，希望我们能够共同创造美好的回忆，用开心与快乐，串联起友情的纽带！💖 ✨ 这个生日会将有精彩的表演、美味的食物和丰富的礼品等着大家！请准时参加，一同度过这个难忘的时刻！✨ 🎁 员工生日是我们共同的庆祝日，让我们一起为生日星们送上最诚挚的祝福，祝福他们的生日充满喜悦和幸福！🎊 ✨ 庆祝员工生日会，让我们更加团结，更加坚定前行！感恩有你们！💪 #员工生日会 #欢乐时光 #友情共庆 #感谢付出"},{"prompt":"请帮我出一条关于9月份员工生日会圆满成功的朋友圈文案","completion":"🎉 9月员工生日会圆满成功！🎉 🌟 在这个特殊的生日月，我们的员工生日会如火如荼地举行了！感慨万分，喜悦满满！💫 🎊 感谢每一个参与生日会的朋友们，你们的热情与支持让这个活动更加精彩！每一位生日星都感受到了你们的关心和祝福！🎂 🙌 生日会现场充满了欢声笑语，大家分享着快乐的时刻，尽情享受着美妙的时光！🎉 ✨ 精彩的表演、美味的食物和丰厚的礼品让我们每一个人都心生感激和满足！这一刻，我们真切地感受到了团队的温暖和凝聚力！💖 🌈 这次生日会不仅是对员工的庆祝，更是对大家辛勤付出的认可和成果的回馈！你们是公司发展的重要力量，感谢你们的奉献与付出！👏 💪 在未来的日子里，让我们继续携手并进，共同创造更多美好的时刻和辉煌的成就！🚀 #员工生日会圆满成功 #团队凝聚力 #感谢付出 #共同成长"},{"prompt":"introduce S687C-OPEN hybrid ceramic ball bearing","completion":"The S687C-OPEN hybrid ceramic ball bearing is a high-performance bearing that combines the advantages of both ceramic and steel materials.

Here's what Steam Points are and how you can spend them. What Are Steam Points? steam logo on a blue backgroud The online game marketplace and streaming service Steam offers some free games for download and play. However, most of the games on Steam cost money. When you purchase content on Steam, you get reward points called Steam Points. For every dollar you spend, you get 100 Steam Points added to your account. You can't convert Steam Points to money, but if you want to think of in terms of \\"Steam Points to dollars\\", you could think of a single Steam Point as one cent. So, what can you do with Steam Points? You can't exchange them for money, but you can \\"spend\\" these points on items available in the Steam Points Shop. How to Get Steam Points There are a lot of ways to accumulate Steam Points. Buying games for yourself is probably the most obvious. However, you also get Steam Points by buying games for other people. Other people can also gift you Steam Points to reward you for community engagement. Keep in mind as well that Steam sells game soundtracks and other downloadable content. These also earn Steam points, so when you purchase a soundtrack or other DLC pack, you'll earn Steam Points here too. As you may have pieced together, how you use Steam has a massive impact on how quickly you earn Steam Points and trade them in for on-platform rewards. If you mainly play free games on Steam, it's hard to rack up points. Meanwhile, the newest AAA release might cost 60 or more, amounting to thousands of Steam Points in a single purchase. How Not to Get Steam Points Unfortunately, not all Steam transactions generate Steam Points. For example, buying a Steam digital gift card doesn't earn you any Steam Points. It would also be nice to see Steam give away free Steam Points if you have an account problem or complaint like some stores give away in-store credit. However, for now, it seems like just about the only way to earn Steam Points is to buy games and downloadable content on Steam. How to Get Steam Points for Free There is one way to get Steam Points for free, and that is to be gifted Steam Points by another user. When you leave reviews and engage with the Steam community in other ways, other Steam users can use their Steam Points to award your interaction. This gives you a special badge and some free Steam Points. How to Check Steam Points Maybe you knew about Steam Points; maybe you didn't. But, you've been buying games on Steam for a while, you're intrigued by the Steam Points shop, and you want to know how to see how many Steam Points you have. It's easy when you know where to look. Whether you access Steam in your browser or the app, you access Steam Points from the same easy-to-find location. From the launch page, click Points Shop from the banner at the top of the screen. Finding the Points Shop on Steam. Explore everything unlockable with Steam points through the menu on the left side of the pane. Steam also displays your point balance in the upper right. The Steam Points Shop homepage What Can You Do With Steam Points? The screenshot above is the landing page for the Points Shop. Scrolling down reveals Featured Items. These are new or seasonal additions that Steam is promoting at the time but may not be of the greatest interest to you. Steam trading cards have changed. The top item in the menu under Featured Items is more personalized to you. These items are Items From Games. If you're a long-time fan of Steam unlockables, this section will feel familiar to you. Most of the items on this page are just updated versions of the Steam Trading Card system. The Items from Games category expanded to include items inspired by all games on Steam as opposed to games that you own or that you and your friends have played. This makes it harder to find wallpapers, profile pictures, and other collectibles from games that you like but it also means that you can get this content for games that you play on other platforms. A selection of profile customization items on the Steam Points Shop The next item down is Item Bundles. This is a way to buy multiple assets at once for a lower price. And, you don't get charged for an item in a bundle if you already own it. Steam Deck Interface Customizations An Interface section includes, Steam Deck Keyboards—virtual keyboards to personalize your Steam Deck. Also in this category is a new customization option for the Steam Deck—a series of Startup Movies. Steam Keyboards available through the Steam Points Shop Profile Items All the items under Profile Items in the menu on the left are unlockables that personalize your profile. Backgrounds, avatars and frames, and badges introduce you to other Steam Community members and show off your stats. Avatars are the icons that represent you to other members of the Steam community. You can upload images other than a photograph to use as your Steam Avatar, but only avatars purchased through the Steam Points Shop move. Profile Backgrounds appear behind your other account items. These can be moving or still, with moving backgrounds costing more Steam Points. Unlike your avatar, you can't upload a background; they can only be unlocked or purchased with Steam Points. Community Awards are stickers that you leave on comments and contributions from other members of the Steam Community. This is a nice feather in their cap, but the person that you're awarding also gets some Steam Points to reward them for their community engagement. Community Awards that can be purchased with Steam Points Seasonal Badges are little items with a floor price of 1,000 Steam Points, going up by 1,000 Steam Points per season. They really just seem to be a way to show off how many Steam Points you have. Game Profiles are bundles of items, usually including backgrounds, avatars, and frames, that are all associated with a particular game. In that way, they're like themed bundles. Artist Profiles work the same way, but all of the art is made by independent creators and isn't associated with a particular game. Showcases help display achievements earned in games rather than in the shop. Gamer stats and achievements are not new to Steam, but Steam limits the space for displaying them on your profile. Purchasing profile showcase upgrades with Steam Points expands that on-screen trophy case. Chat Items Chat Items are emoticons and stickers unlockable for use in Steam's on-platform chat feature. There are different kinds of chat items, but they all work in pretty much the same way. How to Award Steam Points to Others User reviews of a Steam game As mentioned above, you can also use your Steam Points to award other Steam Community members for their contributions. To do this, select the Award button on a comment. From there, you can select how many Steam Points you want to spend on the award (from 300 to 4800), depending on how valuable the comment was to you. How to Redeem Steam Points Previewing an item for sale on the Steam Points Shop When you find an item you want, click it to display a preview of how unlocking that item will affect your profile. If you like it and you have enough Steam Points, click the box displaying the cost of the item in the lower right corner of the pane. Are You Stacking Steam Points? Steam Points represent a step in the evolution of the company's rewards and achievements system. They add an extra level of customization, which many gamers love (let's not forget how crazy people went for cosmetic hats in Team Fortress 2), as it allows you to make your player character your own. Because Steam Points are unlocked by spending money, some rewards that they unlock just brag about how much you spend on video games. However, some unlockable Steam Points content is a genuinely cool way to show off your gaming skill and style.","completion":"With Steam Points, you can spend them on various items available in the Steam Points Shop. These items include profile customization items such as backgrounds, avatars, and badges, as well as items from games like Steam Trading Cards and wallpapers. You can also use Steam Points to purchase item bundles, interface customizations for the Steam Deck, and chat items like emoticons and stickers. Additionally, you can award other Steam Community members with Steam Points for their contributions. Overall, Steam Points allow you to personalize your profile, showcase your gaming achievements, and enhance your Steam experience."},{"prompt":"Can you directly use them for buying games? What about indirectly?","completion":"No, you cannot directly use Steam Points to buy games on the Steam platform. Steam Points can only be spent on items available in the Steam Points Shop, such as profile customization items, game-related items, interface customizations, and chat items. However, indirectly, you can use Steam Points to purchase certain items or bundles that include games. For example, some game profiles in the Steam Points Shop offer bundles that include backgrounds, avatars, frames, and other items related to a specific game. By purchasing these bundles with Steam Points, you can indirectly acquire additional content for the game you're interested in. It's important to note that while Steam Points provide a way to enhance your gaming experience on the platform, they cannot be directly exchanged or used to purchase full games."},{"prompt":"Can one use points to get Steam cards and then use the Steam cards to get games?","completion":"No, you cannot use Steam Points to directly obtain Steam cards and then use those Steam cards to purchase games. Steam Points and Steam cards are separate systems within the Steam platform. Steam Points are a reward system that you earn by making purchases on Steam. These points can be used to redeem various items available in the Steam Points Shop, as mentioned earlier. On the other hand, Steam cards are essentially gift cards that you can purchase and redeem on your Steam account. The funds from the Steam cards can be used to buy games, downloadable content, or other items available on the Steam store. While both systems offer rewards and ways to enhance your experience on Steam, Steam Points and Steam cards cannot be directly exchanged or used interchangeably."},{"prompt":"By Steam cards, I meant the trading cards or whatever that come with games that are bought.","completion":"Apologies for the confusion. Yes, you can use Steam Points to indirectly acquire Steam trading cards, which are collectible items that come with certain games on Steam. When you purchase games on Steam or buy downloadable content for games, you earn Steam Points based on the amount of money spent. Some games also have trading cards associated with them. These trading cards can be obtained by playing the game, and they can be traded, sold, or crafted into badges on the Steam platform. You can use Steam Points to purchase items from the Steam Points Shop, and some of these items include Steam trading cards. By redeeming your Steam Points for trading cards in the Points Shop, you can add them to your collection, trade them with other users, or use them to craft badges. These badges can then grant you additional Steam features like profile customization options or increased Steam experience. So, in a roundabout way, you can use Steam Points to indirectly acquire Steam trading cards through the Points Shop, and then use those cards as desired within the trading card system on Steam."},{"prompt":"I have to write a story as an ece teacher on Violet who is giving swing to her dolly with her friend Wairua in the preschool playground and was really excited to tell me that she is giving swing to her dolly who’s name she has kept as dolly. And her mum’s aspiration for her to be confident and understand which can be seen in this story.","completion":"Once upon a sunny morning, in a charming preschool, there was a little girl named Violet. Violet was a cheerful and outgoing child, with twinkling eyes and a contagious smile that could brighten up any room. She had a best friend named Wairua, who was just as spirited and adventurous. One day, during their playtime at the preschool playground, Violet decided to bring her beloved dolly along. The dolly was named simply \\"Dolly,\\" and it held a special place in Violet's heart. Dolly had been her loyal companion since she was a tiny baby, and Violet took great care of her, just like her own mother did for her. With giggles and excitement, Violet approached her teacher and said, \\"Look, teacher! Dolly wants to swing too! Can I give her a turn on the swing? Please, please!\\" Her teacher, touched by Violet's enthusiasm, smiled and replied, \\"Of course, Violet! Let's go to the swing set and give Dolly a fantastic adventure!\\" Together, Violet, Wairua, and their teacher headed over to the swing set. Violet found the perfect swing and carefully laid her treasured dolly on it, ensuring that Dolly would be safe and secure. Violet, being a responsible little girl, held onto the swing tightly as she began to push her dolly gently back and forth. Her eyes sparkled with delight as she watched Dolly soar through the air, feeling the wind in her hair, just like she had done countless times before. As other children in the playground noticed Violet and her swing-adventurous Dolly, they gathered around, curious to see what was happening. Violet's confidence shone through as she proudly explained, \\"I'm giving Dolly a swing, just like my mommy gives me lots of love and support. Because of her, I feel confident and understand that I can achieve anything!\\" Her friends, amazed by Violet's words, watched in awe as she continued to give Dolly the ride of a lifetime. The tiny doll looked as if she was having the time of her life, spinning and swinging on the vibrant swing. Violet's mom, who had quietly observed her daughter's playtime, beamed with pride. She had always wanted Violet to grow up to be confident and understand her potential, just like she did with her dolly. Violet's excitement and her ability to share her joy with others exemplified the lessons her mother had instilled in her. The joyful moment on the swing set encapsulated Violet's mom's aspiration for her. It was a magical testament to the bond between a mother and her child, as well as a gentle reminder that through play, children can learn powerful life lessons. From that day forward, Violet continued to share her love and knowledge with her friends, always encouraging them to explore their own passions and believe in themselves, just like she did with her dolly on that enchanting day at the preschool playground. And as for Dolly, she continued to be Violet's faithful companion, joining her on countless swinging and soaring adventures, forever reminding her of the importance of confidence and understanding."},{"prompt":"correct grammar: \\"Hi Jasmine, I am Jimmy from Insights Lab.

Nearly all districts indicated businesses “renewed their previously unfulfilled expectations that wage growth will slow broadly in the near term,” it said. The Fed’s report indicated US consumers remain robust, especially when it comes to spending on travel and other services, but also showed signs of fraying at the edges of the economy. Slowing demand for goods is weighing on the manufacturing sector and elevated interest rates are continuing to pressure the housing market, where a reluctance to give up a low-rate mortgage has contributed to a shortage of supply. WATCH: The Federal Reserve’s Beige Book survey of regional business contacts shows growth in the US economy and jobs market slowed in July and August. Emily Graffeo reports. Read more: US Home Purchase Applications Fall to Lowest Since 1995 Companies around the country are reporting increasing difficulty in passing higher costs along to customers, the Beige Book showed. Some regions saw evidence of consumers having run down excess savings and turning more to borrowing to finance purchases. Data last week showed that despite broad-based job gains in August, some parts of the labor market are cooling. Wages rose at the slowest pace since early 2022 and even as more people joined the workforce, a growing number were unable to find work right away. Inflation pressures have also abated somewhat. The core personal consumption expenditures index, the Fed’s preferred measure of underlying inflation, rose 0.2% in July for a second straight month, down from readings above 0.3% earlier this year. “Most districts reported price growth slowed overall, decelerating faster in manufacturing and consumer-goods sectors,” according to the Beige Book. “However, contacts in several districts highlighted sharp increases in property-insurance costs during the past few months.” Fed officials are moving more cautiously after raising rates at an aggressive pace last year and delivering more tightening at most meetings this year. Policymaker forecasts published in June indicated two more hikes this year, one of which was delivered at July’s meeting. Many officials have signaled that they may opt to pause at this month’s meeting to continue assessing disinflation progress, though some have said one or more increases may be needed to fully cool price pressures. Policymakers, though committed to bringing inflation down, have said they’re hoping the Fed’s actions won’t needlessly spur a recession.

The San Francisco and Dallas Feds said there was increased demand, especially among older adults, with the Dallas Fed citing inflation as a particular burden for seniors. Chair Jerome Powell, speaking last month at the central bank’s annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, said the Fed is prepared to raise interest rates further if needed and intends to keep borrowing costs high until inflation is on a convincing path toward its 2% target. The Beige Book, based on anecdotal information from the Fed’s 12 regional banks, was put together by the Kansas City Fed based on information gathered on or before Aug. 28.\\"","completion":"According to the Federal Reserve's Beige Book survey of regional businesses, growth in the US economy and jobs market slowed in July and August.

The greenback scaled a fresh top of 147.865 yen in early Asia trade, its highest since last November. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was last 0.05% higher at 104.91, holding on to some of its gains from the previous session after scaling a six-month peak on news that the U.S. services sector unexpectedly gained steam in August. Advertisement · Scroll to continue The stronger-than-expected data pushed the euro to its lowest since June at 1.0703 on Wednesday, with the single currency last 0.03% lower at 1.0723. Sterling similarly lost 0.07% to stand at 1.24985, having also bottomed at a three-month trough of 1.24835 in the previous session. \\"It certainly was a good (ISM) ... so those thinking of a (U.S.) recession in the near term might be a little bit disappointed,\\" said Joseph Capurso, head of international and sustainable economics at Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA). \\"However, the Beige Book ... wasn't that great, actually.\\" Advertisement · Scroll to continue Report this ad U.S. economic growth was \\"modest\\" in recent weeks, job growth was \\"subdued,\\" and inflation slowed in most parts of the country, the Federal Reserve report published on Wednesday showed. \\"I think that what's really driving the dollar is not so much that the U.S. economy is doing great, but it's doing better than elsewhere.\\" Market pricing shows a near 47% chance that the Fed might deliver another rate hike in November, according to the CME FedWatch tool, though expectations are for policymakers to keep rates on hold later this month. Advertisement · Scroll to continue Conversely, Bank of England (BoE) Governor Andrew Bailey said on Wednesday that the central bank is \\"much nearer\\" to the end of its rate-hike cycle, though borrowing costs might still have further to rise because of stubborn inflation pressures. On the same day, European Central Bank policymakers warned investors that the decision for a rate increase next week was still up in the air, but a rise in borrowing costs was among the options on the table. \\"It was surprising to see those dovish comments from Governor Bailey ... that certainly does make us comfortable that they're only going to hike twice more,\\" Capurso said, referring to the BoE. \\"As for the ECB, what we're noticing is that there's a real divergence happening between various ECB members, and that to me is suggesting that at most you get one more rate hike out of the ECB.\\" ASIA DANGER? In Japan, traders continued to be on intervention watch as a fragile yen struggled to make headway against the dollar even as officials step up their warnings against a sell-off in the yen. The Japanese currency last bought 147.76 per dollar, having weakened past the closely-watched 145 threshold for nearly a month now. That was the key level which prompted an intervention by the authorities to support the yen last year. \\"Yen's verbal intervention begs the question whether a real intervention is likely,\\" said Saxo market strategist Charu Chanana. \\"As we have seen in the past, real intervention barely reverses the course of the yen sustainably.\\" The Australian dollar slid 0.05% to 0.63795, while the New Zealand dollar fell 0.01% to 0.5869, with both languishing near their recent 10-month lows. China's trade figures are due later on Thursday, which could put further pressure on the antipodean currencies if the data points to further weakness in the world's second-largest economy. The two are often used as liquid proxies for the Chinese yuan. The offshore yuan was last marginally lower at 7.3241 per dollar.

В свойстве \`label\` и инициализаторе \`init?(_ value: String)\`, \`self\` ссылается на текущую \\"сущность\\" перечисления, для которой выполняется код. В данном случае, она используется в \`switch self\` для проверки значения текущего экземпляра перечисления и выполнения соответствующих действий. 2. Внутри вычисляемого свойства \`int\`: в данном случае \`self\` не используется, потому что нет необходимости обращаться к текущему экземпляру перечисления, чтобы вычислить значение свойства. Здесь \`self\` использовано для иллюстрации синтаксиса обращения к текущему экземпляру перечисления, но в данном случае оно не является обязательным. Обратите внимание, что \`self\` в данном коде может быть опущен, так как Swift позволяет доступ к свойствам и методам экземпляра и без явного использования \`self\`. Однако, в данном случае использование \`self\` помогает сделать код более ясным и явным, а также указывает на контекст текущего экземпляра перечисления."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

MyThread : public QThread { Q_OBJECT public: void run() override { // 多线程的逻辑... } }; \`\`\` 2. 使用\`QObject\`派生类和\`moveToThread()\`方法：创建一个继承自\`QObject\`的类，并将其实例移动到一个新的线程中。通过在新线程中执行类的槽函数实现多线程的逻辑。 \`\`\`cpp class Worker : public QObject { Q_OBJECT public slots: void doWork() { // 多线程的逻辑... } }; int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { QApplication app(argc, argv); // 创建Worker实例 Worker worker; //

首先，在发送数据的对象中定义一个信号，信号是一种特殊的函数，用于触发某个事件的发生。然后，在接收数据的对象中定义一个槽，槽是信号的处理函数，用于对接收到的数据进行处理。 以下是一个示例代码，演示了如何在两个对象之间发送和接收数据： \`\`\`cpp class Sender : public QObject { Q_OBJECT public: // 定义一个信号，带有一个整型参数 signals: void dataSent(int data); public slots: // 发送数据的槽函数 void sendData() { int data = 100; // 发射信号，并传递数据 emit dataSent(data); } }; class Receiver : public QObject { Q_OBJECT public slots: //

创建接收数据的对象 Receiver receiver; // 连接信号和槽 QObject::connect(&sender, &Sender::dataSent, &receiver, &Receiver::receiveData); // 发送数据 sender.sendData(); return app.exec(); } \`\`\` 在上述示例中，\`Sender\`类中定义了一个信号\`dataSent\`，并在\`sendData()\`槽函数中发射该信号并传递数据。\`Receiver\`类中定义了一个槽函数\`receiveData()\`，用于接收信号传递的数据并进行处理。在\`main()\`函数中，通过\`QObject::connect()\`方法将信号和槽进行连接，当信号被发射时，槽函数会被自动调用。 需要注意的是，信号和槽连接时，必须保证槽函数的参数类型和个数与信号相匹配。同时，需要保证发送和接收数据的对象都是\`QObject\`的子类，并且在定义类时添加\`Q_OBJECT\`宏，以启用信号和槽机制的特性。"},{"prompt":"给我一句话描述室内平面拍摄灯光参考，要拍出来是有时尚感的","completion":"室内平面拍摄灯光参考：巧妙运用明暗对比和柔和灯光，营造优雅而时尚的氛围。"},{"prompt":"اكتب

首先，鸦片战争揭示了中国经济与科技的相对滞后。当时，中国封闭的政策使得中国落后于欧洲列强，在军事技术、工业生产和航海技术等方面相对薄弱。这导致中国难以与外国列强进行公平的对话和抵抗，最终被迫接受不利的不平等条约。 其次，鸦片战争揭示了清朝政府腐败和无能的问题。清朝政府缺乏反腐倡廉和行政能力，无法有效管理国家事务和保护国家利益。这种腐败和无能加剧了中国面临外部威胁、内部混乱和割让领土的风险。 此外，鸦片战争还显露了中国社会的内部矛盾和分裂。清朝统治者的腐败和无能导致了全国范围内的社会动荡，各方势力争相崛起，带来了混乱和内乱的局面。这种内部矛盾和分裂使中国无法团结起来应对外部威胁，进一步削弱了国家的实力。 最重要的是，鸦片战争给了中国人民以深刻的觉醒，他们意识到了中国所面临的危机和困境。这促使中国人民在之后的岁月中以民族振兴为目标，形成了反对封建制度和封闭政策、追求国家独立和强大的潮流。这场战争教育着中国人民，激励他们探索新的目标和道路，为中国的崛起和发展奠定了基础。 因此，鸦片战争的教训提醒我们要珍惜国家的独立和发展，重视对外的平等交往和对内的改革与进步。同时，我们也应该保持警惕，避免重蹈历史覆辙，充分认识到自身的不足，并加强自我改革与提升，以确保我们能够在国际竞争中立于不败之地，实现国家的繁荣与稳定。"},{"prompt":"林则徐虎门销烟的过程","completion":"林则徐是清朝时期的一位大臣，他被委派前往虎门销烟（即禁烟）是为了应对鸦片问题。销烟的过程大致可以分为以下几个阶段： 第一阶段是调查研究阶段。在接受任务后，林则徐首先进行了一系列的调查和研究工作。他深入了解鸦片的来源、贩运渠道以及吸食者的情况，并且了解到鸦片已经对中国的社会、经济和文化造成了严重的破坏。 第二阶段是宣布禁烟令。在详细了解情况后，林则徐在1839年6月的一天，在广州虎门口附近海域的船上召开了一次庄严的仪式。在这个仪式上，他宣布了一个名为《钦令销烟》的法令，明确表示任何人在未来都不得贩卖、吸食或持有鸦片，并罚款并没收相关物品。 第三阶段是执法严格阶段。随着禁烟令的宣布，林则徐派遣大量的军队和官员前往各地，逐步推行严厉的禁烟政策。这些官员负责检查商店、酒店、居民和船只，以确保禁烟令得到严格执行。同时，他们还与英国鸦片贩子进行了激烈的斗争，破获了大量的鸦片案件。 尽管林则徐和他的团队在销烟过程中付出了巨大的努力，然而他们还是遇到了很多困难和阻力。英国列强对禁烟政策表示强烈反对，并动用军力进行了报复，最终导致了鸦片战争的爆发。尽管如此，林则徐的销烟举措奠定了中国禁烟的基础，为之后的反鸦片斗争打下了坚实的基础，并开启了中国近代化的第一步。 林则徐的虎门销烟过程不仅是对鸦片问题的应对，更是一次对国家利益和民族尊严的捍卫。他的举措体现了他对中国国家和人民的担忧，以及他对封建社会的不满和对国家独立的追求。他的努力和牺牲为后来中国的现代化事业树立了榜样，并在中国历史上留下了深远的影响。"},{"prompt":"鸦片战争中我能学到什么？","completion":"鸦片战争带来了众多的教训和启示，以下是一些你可以从鸦片战争中学到的重要教训： 1. 同理心和平等交往的重要性：鸦片战争揭示出了外国列强对中国的不平等对待和剥削，这进一步证明了同理心和平等交往的重要性。在国际关系中，平等和互相尊重是建立稳定和持久的合作关系的关键。 2. 保护国家利益的重要性：鸦片战争揭示了清朝政府在保护国家利益方面的失败，这给我们教导了保护国家利益的重要性。国家应该采取措施，保护自己的主权和独立，以确保国家的长期发展和繁荣。 3. 学习历史教训：鸦片战争告诉我们学习历史教训的重要性。了解过去的错误和失败，可以帮助我们避免重蹈覆辙，并为未来的决策提供宝贵的参考。 4. 强化国防能力：鸦片战争揭示了中国在国防能力方面的薄弱，这迫使我们认识到，一个强大的国家需要具备坚实的国防力量。投资于军事技术、现代化装备和军事战备的发展，可以确保国家的安全和独立。 5. 推动科技和现代化：鸦片战争揭示了中国在科技和现代化方面的滞后，在军事技术、工业化和航海技术等方面相对薄弱。这提醒我们，一个国家的发展和强大需要加大科技创新和现代化进程的力度。 6. 民族自强精神：鸦片战争唤起了中国人民的民族自强意识，推动了中国的近代化进程。从鸦片战争中，我们可以学到不屈不挠、艰苦奋斗、追求民族独立和崛起的精神。 总之，鸦片战争教导我们学习历史教训，保护国家利益，强化国防能力，推进科技和现代化，并培养民族自强精神。通过从鸦片战争中获取教训，我们可以更好地理解中国的发展历程，并为未来的挑战做好准备。"},{"prompt":"迎新生入校活动总结","completion":"迎新生入校活动是一个非常重要的环节，能够给新生留下深刻的第一印象，并让他们感受到学校的热情和关怀。下面是对迎新生入校活动的总结： 1.

The greenback scaled a fresh top of 147.865 yen in early Asia trade, its highest since last November. Against a basket of currencies, the dollar was last 0.05% higher at 104.91, holding on to some of its gains from the previous session after scaling a six-month peak on news that the U.S. services sector unexpectedly gained steam in August. Advertisement · Scroll to continue The stronger-than-expected data pushed the euro to its lowest since June at 1.0703 on Wednesday, with the single currency last 0.03% lower at 1.0723. Sterling similarly lost 0.07% to stand at 1.24985, having also bottomed at a three-month trough of 1.24835 in the previous session. “It certainly was a good (ISM) … so those thinking of a (U.S.) recession in the near term might be a little bit disappointed,” said Joseph Capurso, head of international and sustainable economics at Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA). “However, the Beige Book … wasn’t that great, actually.” Advertisement · Scroll to continue Report this ad U.S. economic growth was “modest” in recent weeks, job growth was “subdued,” and inflation slowed in most parts of the country, the Federal Reserve report published on Wednesday showed. “I think that what’s really driving the dollar is not so much that the U.S. economy is doing great, but it’s doing better than elsewhere.” Market pricing shows a near 47% chance that the Fed might deliver another rate hike in November, according to the CME FedWatch tool, though expectations are for policymakers to keep rates on hold later this month. Advertisement · Scroll to continue Conversely, Bank of England (BoE) Governor Andrew Bailey said on Wednesday that the central bank is “much nearer” to the end of its rate-hike cycle, though borrowing costs might still have further to rise because of stubborn inflation pressures. On the same day, European Central Bank policymakers warned investors that the decision for a rate increase next week was still up in the air, but a rise in borrowing costs was among the options on the table. “It was surprising to see those dovish comments from Governor Bailey … that certainly does make us comfortable that they’re only going to hike twice more,” Capurso said, referring to the BoE. “As for the ECB, what we’re noticing is that there’s a real divergence happening between various ECB members, and that to me is suggesting that at most you get one more rate hike out of the ECB.” ASIA DANGER? In Japan, traders continued to be on intervention watch as a fragile yen struggled to make headway against the dollar even as officials step up their warnings against a sell-off in the yen. The Japanese currency last bought 147.76 per dollar, having weakened past the closely-watched 145 threshold for nearly a month now. That was the key level which prompted an intervention by the authorities to support the yen last year. “Yen’s verbal intervention begs the question whether a real intervention is likely,” said Saxo market strategist Charu Chanana. “As we have seen in the past, real intervention barely reverses the course of the yen sustainably.” The Australian dollar slid 0.05% to 0.63795, while the New Zealand dollar fell 0.01% to 0.5869, with both languishing near their recent 10-month lows. China’s trade figures are due later on Thursday, which could put further pressure on the antipodean currencies if the data points to further weakness in the world’s second-largest economy. The two are often used as liquid proxies for the Chinese yuan. The offshore yuan was last marginally lower at 7.3241 per dollar.

You mean just another portion of the empire. Russia and the independent countries that were once part of the Soviet Union? Not a problem. Egypt and Sudan's border dispute? Gone, part of the empire.","completion":"In the year 2035, the world faced an unforeseen tide of change. The conqueror, known only as Magnus, emerged from the depths of secrecy with a force that swept across nations like an unstoppable storm. With a military unrivaled in strength and advanced technology beyond comprehension, Magnus set out to reshape the world as never before. Magnus's intentions were as perplexing as they were audacious. Unlike other conquerors throughout history, he had no thirst for power, wealth, or glory. Instead, his sole purpose was to bring an end to the centuries-old border disputes and legitimacy crises that plagued nations. China and Taiwan, indecisive for decades, were swiftly brought under the umbrella of Magnus's empire. Overnight, the dispute dissolved, and the two became united, albeit reluctantly, ending generations of hostility. It was a baffling turn of events that left the world in awe. Next, Magnus turned his gaze to the South Asian subcontinent. India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan, with their conflicting ideologies and long-simmering tensions, were amalgamated into the empire. The people were cautious yet relieved, for Magnus had managed in mere weeks what diplomacy had failed to achieve in decades. Borders became nothing more than lines on a map, rendered irrelevant by a higher authority. In the Middle East, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that had tormented generations became no more than a historical footnote. Magnus's empire encompassed both territories, creating a unified land where mutual respect and understanding replaced animosity. Former adversaries had little choice but to coexist, ushering in a fragile peace that seemed unimaginable before. With each conquest, Magnus's empire expanded further, stretching its reach across the globe. Russia and the once-independent countries that had emerged from the Soviet Union became part of the fold, transcending their historical separations. In Eastern Europe, new-found unity replaced former divisions, providing stability where chaos once reigned. Even Egypt and Sudan, locked in a bitter border dispute that seemed destined to persist indefinitely, found themselves face to face with Magnus's unyielding force. With a firm, yet gentle hand, he put an end to their conflict, absorbing both into his empire, erasing the lines that once defined their differences. As Magnus's empire grew, the world transformed. Borders vanished, disputes evaporated, and an unprecedented era of collective purpose and cooperation emerged. Nations that had been driven apart for centuries now found themselves united by a common cause – progress. Yet, questions lingered. Who was this mysterious conqueror, and how did he possess such overwhelming power? What drove him to embark on this awe-inspiring quest? The answers were elusive, buried beneath the layers of Magnus's enigmatic persona. Some whispered that Magnus was an artificial intelligence, an advanced mind born from technology far beyond human comprehension. Others believed he was an extraterrestrial being, sent to guide mankind toward a more harmonious coexistence. Speculations and theories ran rampant, but the truth remained concealed within Magnus's enigmatic empire. While the world marveled at the newfound peace, a tinge of unease swept across nations. The absence of border disputes and the uniformity of Magnus's empire, though achieved with noble intentions, sparked a debate on individuality, freedom, and the essence of what it meant to be a state. As the world grappled with these complex questions, Magnus's empire stood as an enigma, a testament to mankind's capacity for unity, yet surrounded by an air of caution. Though his intentions were noble, the road to a peaceful world was paved with sacrifices. And in this new era, one question remained: had the world truly found peace, or had it traded one form of conflict for another?"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Citando los autores y edición de sus escritos","completion":"Características físicas y psicológicas de los adultos mayores Introducción En el presente escrito se abordarán las características físicas y psicológicas de los adultos mayores. El envejecimiento es un proceso natural por el cual todos los seres humanos pasamos, y esta etapa de la vida trae consigo cambios físicos y psicológicos significativos. Comprender y conocer estas características es fundamental para garantizar el bienestar y la calidad de vida de los adultos mayores. Características físicas de los adultos mayores El envejecimiento trae consigo cambios físicos notables en las personas mayores. Uno de los principales cambios se encuentra en la disminución de la capacidad física y funcional. Según Chico (2015), esto se debe a procesos como la sarcopenia, que es la pérdida de masa muscular y fuerza, y la osteoporosis, que es la disminución de la densidad ósea. Además, los adultos mayores presentan una disminución de la capacidad visual y auditiva. De acuerdo con García (2019), esto se debe al deterioro natural de los órganos sensoriales, así como a enfermedades como la degeneración macular y la presbiacusia. Por otro lado, el envejecimiento también implica cambios en el sistema cardiovascular. Según López (2017), los adultos mayores tienen una disminución en la elasticidad de los vasos sanguíneos, lo que puede llevar a la hipertensión arterial y aumentar el riesgo de enfermedades cardiovasculares. Características psicológicas de los adultos mayores Además de los cambios físicos, el envejecimiento también afecta la salud psicológica de las personas mayores. Uno de los aspectos más relevantes es el deterioro cognitivo. Según Fernández (2020), el envejecimiento normal puede llevar a dificultades en la memoria, la atención y el procesamiento de la información. Asimismo, los adultos mayores pueden experimentar cambios emocionales significativos. De acuerdo con Rodríguez (2018), es común que se presenten sentimientos de tristeza, angustia o irritabilidad debido a la pérdida de seres queridos, enfermedades crónicas o situaciones de dependencia. Por otro lado, el envejecimiento también puede traer consigo cambios en la personalidad de los adultos mayores. Según Pérez (2016), es común observar una mayor tendencia a la reflexión y la introspección, así como una disminución en la impulsividad y aumento en la paciencia. Conclusiones En conclusión, los adultos mayores experimentan cambios físicos y psicológicos significativos como parte del proceso de envejecimiento. Estos cambios pueden afectar la capacidad física, los sentidos, el sistema cardiovascular, la memoria, las emociones y la personalidad. Es fundamental tener en cuenta estas características para poder brindar un adecuado acompañamiento y cuidado a los adultos mayores, garantizando así su bienestar y calidad de vida.

Depuis quelques jours, elle faisait des rêves étranges et mystérieux. Chaque nuit, elle rencontrait un homme qui faisait battre son cœur d'une manière inexpliquée. Au début, l'environnement de son rêve était sombre, presque sinistre. Mais à mesure de leurs rencontres, le décor changeait, devenant chaotique puis finalement ensoleillé. Marie ne pouvait s'empêcher de penser que ces paysages reflétaient son état d'esprit. Cependant, la réalité que Marie vivait était moins idyllique. Elle souffrait d'une maladie cardiaque, et son cœur était en train de la trahir. Alors qu'elle cherchait désespérément un donneur compatible, l'angoisse de sa propre mort grandissait chaque jour. Ce fardeau pesait lourdement sur elle et elle avait l'impression que son mari, Jean, ne la soutenait pas assez. Dans ses rêves, l'homme mystérieux semblait comprendre sa douleur. Il l'écoutait avec une attention sincère et lui offrait un soutien inconditionnel. Chaque nuit, il lui parlait avec des mots apaisants, comme s'il connaissait le fond de son âme. Marie se sentait compris et aimé d'une manière qu'elle n'avait jamais ressentie auparavant. À mesure que les jours passaient, les rencontres de Marie avec cet homme se faisaient de plus en plus fréquentes. Les couleurs sombres et inquiétantes du début avaient cédé la place à un chaos bouillonnant, puis à une clarté éclatante. Marie était fascinée par cette transformation, comme si son esprit s'ouvrait à de nouvelles possibilités. Mais alors même que son esprit commençait à se libérer, son corps était en train de la trahir. Les médecins n'avaient toujours pas trouvé de donneur compatible, et Marie était convaincue qu'elle allait mourir. Pendant ce temps, Jean continuait de vivre sa vie presque normalement, paraissant presque indifférent à la souffrance de sa femme. Le jour de son anniversaire de mariage, Marie était plongée dans une tristesse profonde. Elle se sentait seule et abandonnée, ne pouvant s'empêcher de penser que Jean ne partagerait jamais ses fardeaux. Alors qu'elle contemplait son reflet dans le miroir, elle fut surpris de voir l'homme de ses rêves se matérialiser derrière elle. \\"Tu m'as trouvé, Marie,\\" murmura-t-il d'une voix douce. \\"Je suis là, et je suis toujours là. Nous sommes destinés à être ensemble.\\" Marie se retourna, les yeux remplis de larmes. Elle réalisa soudainement que l'homme mystérieux de ses rêves et son mari, Jean, étaient la même personne. \\"Jean... Mais pourquoi... Pourquoi ne m'as-tu pas montré ton amour et ton soutien dans la réalité ? Pourquoi as-tu attendu mes rêves pour me le dire ?\\" sanglota-t-elle. Jean la prit dans ses bras. \\"Marie, je t'aime plus que tout au monde. Ces rêves sont ma manière maladroite de te montrer combien tu comptes pour moi. J'ai espéré que tu pourrais ressentir mon amour même à travers eux.\\" Marie réalisa alors que Jean avait ses propres peurs et qu'il essayait de les dissimuler pour la protéger. Ils se regardèrent dans les yeux, sentant un amour profond les envelopper. Dans les jours qui suivirent, Marie et Jean se rapprochèrent davantage. Ils partagèrent leurs craintes, leurs espoirs et leurs désirs les plus profonds. La maladie de Marie continuait de la menacer, mais elle se sentait soutenue et aimée comme jamais auparavant. Finalement, un donneur compatible fut trouvé et Marie réussit à surmonter sa maladie. Son cœur retrouva sa vitalité, tout comme son amour pour Jean, qui grandissait de jour en jour.

Les rêves de Marie se font de plus en plus fréquents, et chaque fois, l'environnement évolue. Les ténèbres et le chaos prennent vie, reflétant l'angoisse grandissante de la protagoniste. Mais alors que les paysages rêvés semblent dépeindre un monde voué à la destruction, Marie trouve du réconfort et de l'amour auprès de l'homme mystérieux. Dans les songes, il écoute attentivement ses peines, lui offre son soutien inconditionnel et lui murmure des paroles réconfortantes. Marie se sent enfin comprise et aimée, ce qui la pousse à remettre en question sa relation avec Jean. La tension monte alors que Marie oscille entre l'amour pour son mari et la fascination pour l'homme des rêves. Les scènes de rêve sont scénarisées par Alfred Hitchcock avec une maîtrise du suspense, plongeant le spectateur dans l'esprit tourmenté de Marie. Finalement, le jour de son anniversaire de mariage, Marie fait face à un moment de vérité. Elle se tient devant son miroir et l'homme mystérieux apparaît une fois de plus. Les larmes coulent sur ses joues alors qu'elle réalise qu'il est en réalité son mari, Jean. L'homme mystérieux et son mari sont une seule et même personne. \\"Il fallait que tu le comprennes, Marie,\\" dit Jean, d'une voix empreinte de tristesse et de regret. \\"Je voulais te montrer combien je t'aimais, mais tu étais trop enfermée dans tes rêves pour le voir.\\" Marie est submergée par la révélation. Elle se rend compte qu'elle avait repoussé Jean, aveuglée par sa propre douleur. L'amour sincère de Jean et son soutien indéfectible étaient là depuis le début, mais elle avait failli les perdre à cause de son obsession pour son rêve énigmatique. Deux jours après cette révélation, Marie reçoit enfin le message qu'un donneur compatible a été trouvé. Son opération cardiaque est imminente, et elle rêve une dernière fois de l'homme mystérieux. Cette fois-ci, elle se rend compte que c'était Jean tout le long, lui offrant ainsi son propre cœur afin qu'elle puisse vivre. L'histoire se termine avec un sentiment de suspense et de soulagement. Le spectateur émerge d'une réalité distordue et intense, tout comme Marie. Le génie d'Alfred Hitchcock met en valeur les émotions tourmentées de l'héroïne tout en nous offrant un retournement final qui laisse une empreinte indélébile dans nos esprits. L'histoire de Marie dans ses rêves et sa lutte contre sa maladie cardiaque illustrent à quel point la souffrance peut éclipser la réalité. L'amour et le soutien de son mari étaient toujours présents, mais sa vision était obscurcie par ses propres peurs et son sentiment d'abandon. C'est un rappel poignant de l'importance de la communication et de la reconnaissance de l'amour qui nous entoure, même lorsque nous sommes perdus dans notre propre monde intérieur."},{"prompt":"d'ecrire un monde qui evolue avec les pensée d'une jeune fille au debut elle est suicidaire et la fin elle est pleine de vie . les elements doit du monde doit etre une reference a l etats d esprit expliquer en quoi c'est element repsente l etat d esprix","completion":"Il était une fois une jeune fille nommée Emma, dont l'esprit était en proie à de sombres pensées, un monde intérieur rempli de tourments. Au début de notre histoire, elle était profondément suicidaire, se sentant prisonnière de ses propres démons. Dans ce monde intérieur, l'environnement reflétait l'état d'esprit d'Emma. Les cieux étaient sombres, couverts de nuages gris et menaçants, symbolisant sa tristesse et son désespoir. Les paysages étaient stériles, dépourvus de vie, avec des arbres dénudés et des fleurs fanées, reflétant sa détresse émotionnelle. Emma marchait dans ces lieux désolés, son regard fixé sur le sol, sans goût pour la vie qui l'entourait. Chaque pas qu'elle faisait creusait un sillon dans le sol, représentant les cicatrices invisibles de sa souffrance intérieure. Les rivières étaient noires et tumultueuses, emportant avec elles ses pensées sombres et noyant tout espoir. Pourtant, à mesure que l'histoire se développe, l'état d'esprit d'Emma commence à évoluer. Des rencontres fortuites avec des personnages imaginaires lui insufflent des lueurs d'espoir, lui apportant des mots réconfortants et des gestes attentionnés. Ces interactions éveillent en elle un désir de vivre, un besoin de trouver sa place dans le monde. Progressivement, le monde intérieur d'Emma change également. Les nuages gris se disloquent, révélant des rayons de soleil qui percent à travers, éclairant son chemin et sa vision. Les arbres retrouvent leur verdure luxuriante, se balançant doucement au rythme d'une brise apaisante. Les fleurs commencent à éclore, symbolisant l'épanouissement de l'esprit d'Emma. Alors qu'Emma embrasse ces changements, elle commence à lever les yeux vers le ciel, à s'émerveiller des merveilles qui l'entourent. Les paysages désolés se transforment en prairies verdoyantes et vallées luxuriantes. Les rivières se muent en ruisseaux joyeux, chuchotant des promesses d'un avenir radieux. Chaque élément du monde intérieur d'Emma représente son état d'esprit changeant. Les éléments sombres et tristes symbolisent son désespoir initial, tandis que les éléments lumineux et vivants représentent son regain de vie.

Here are some of the things he did: 1. Funeral Oration: Pericles delivered a famous speech known as the Funeral Oration, as recorded by Thucydides. This speech was given at the end of the first year of the Peloponnesian War and honored Athenian soldiers who died in battle. Pericles used this speech to extol the virtues of democracy and the Athenian way of life, emphasizing the importance of citizen participation and democratic principles. 2. Promoting Civic Engagement: Pericles encouraged and motivated Athenian citizens to actively participate in the democratic process. He emphasized the responsibilities of citizens to serve the state, both in military service and through active involvement in political affairs. Pericles sought to involve as many citizens as possible and believed in expanding democracy to include a broader spectrum of society. 3. Supporting Jury System: Pericles worked to strengthen the judicial system and ensure that it functioned impartially. He increased the number of jurors serving on Athenian juries, making the system more inclusive and representative. Pericles believed in the importance of fair and public trials, where every citizen had the opportunity to participate. 4. Equal Opportunity for Public Office: Pericles initiated reforms that allowed more Athenian citizens, regardless of their economic status, to hold public office. Previously, higher offices were only accessible to those from aristocratic families. By opening up public office to a wider range of citizens, Pericles aimed to promote equality and prevent power from being concentrated in the hands of the few. 5. Architectural Projects: Pericles used public works and architectural projects to showcase Athenian democracy and establish a sense of collective pride. He oversaw the construction of the Parthenon, the Propylaea, and other iconic buildings on the Acropolis, turning it into a symbol of Athenian power, wealth, and democratic values. Overall, Pericles's speeches and actions aimed to strengthen the democratic system in Athens, expand citizen participation, promote equality, and create a sense of collective identity among Athenian citizens."},{"prompt":"收到一共80名员工填报各个部门岗位的志愿，请帮我撰写一份信息汇总报告的提纲给领导","completion":"一、调查背景 - 说明调查目的和背景，即收集员工对各个部门岗位的志愿情况，以便为组织内部的人力资源调配提供参考和决策依据。 二、调查方法 - 说明调查采用的方法和流程，如何收集员工填报志愿，并确保数据的准确性和保密性。 三、样本及统计结果 - 统计样本人数，即收到的填报志愿的员工人数为80人，并说明所占比例。 - 分别列出各个部门和岗位的填报情况，以及每个部门和岗位的填报人数和所占比例。 - 统计出各个部门和岗位的填报人数最多和最少的情况，并说明原因。 四、员工意愿分析 - 对员工填报志愿的原因进行分析，包括薪资待遇、职业发展、工作环境、个人兴趣等因素。 - 分析员工填报志愿的分布情况是否符合预期，是否存在一些部门或岗位的填报热度远高于其他部门或岗位，以及可能的原因。 五、建议和决策 - 根据调查结果，提出建议，如是否需要根据员工填报情况进行岗位调整、薪资待遇调整等。 - 根据调查结果，决策各个部门和岗位的人员调配方案，以满足员工的意愿，并提高组织的整体绩效。 六、总结 - 总结调查的目的、方法和结果，并强调调查的重要性和对组织决策的影响。 七、附录 - 在附录中提供完整的员工填报志愿的数据表格和具体统计结果。 备注：以上提纲仅供参考，具体报告的内容和结构根据实际情况可以做适当调整。"},{"prompt":"请帮忙列出40家机械类的外企","completion":"以下是40家机械类的外企，仅供参考： 1.

Intersectional feminism recognizes the interconnectedness of gender with other aspects of identity such as race, class, sexuality, and ability. This approach emphasizes the need to address gender disparities in education by understanding and challenging the intersecting forms of oppression and discrimination that different individuals may face. Here are a few key points for why this position is significant: 1. Inclusivity: Intersectional feminism promotes inclusivity by recognizing the diverse experiences and needs of individuals within the education system. It acknowledges that gender inequality affects people differently depending on their intersecting identities and experiences. Through an inclusive approach, educators can create a learning environment that values and supports all students. 2. Empowerment: This perspective aims to empower individuals by challenging traditional gender norms and expectations that may limit opportunities and perpetuate inequalities. It encourages students to critically analyze societal structures and engage in discussions and activities that challenge gender stereotypes, fostering a sense of agency and self-determination. 3. Justice and Equity: An intersectional feminist approach to gender and education seeks to address inequities by striving for justice. This involves advocating for policy changes and implementing strategies to create equal opportunities for all genders. It acknowledges that attaining gender equality in education requires dismantling systems of oppression that intersect with gender. 4. Critical Thinking and Reflection: Intersectional feminism promotes critical thinking by encouraging students to examine the ways in which gender is constructed and maintained within society. By cultivating critical consciousness, students can challenge dominant narratives and identify gender biases in the educational system, thereby fostering a more equitable learning environment. Overall, this pedagogical/philosophical position towards gender and education emphasizes the importance of recognizing and addressing the intersecting dynamics of gender inequality in order to create a more inclusive, empowering, and equitable education system."},{"prompt":"定时器是怎么做的重复执行语句的","completion":"定时器是通过设置一个特定的时间间隔，然后每隔这个时间间隔执行一次特定的语句或函数。 在编程中，可以使用不同的方法来创建定时器。下面是一个常见的定时器实现方法的示例： 1. 使用setTimeout()函数 \`\`\`javascript function myFunction() { // 执行的语句或函数 console.log(\\"Hello, world!\\");

Here are some possible causes: 1. Degradation: Over time, products can degrade and undergo chemical or physical changes, leading to the formation of impurities. If the product is not stable under certain environmental conditions, such as temperature or humidity, degradation can occur, resulting in impurity formation. 2. Contamination: During the manufacturing or packaging process, the product can come into contact with contaminants. These contaminants can react with the product or decompose over time, leading to the presence of impurities. 3. Incompatibility: The product formulation may contain substances that are not compatible with each other. Over time, these incompatible substances can react with each other, resulting in the formation of impurities. 4. Storage conditions: If the product is not stored under appropriate conditions, such as exposure to extreme temperatures or sunlight, it can lead to chemical reactions that generate impurities. 5. Chemical reactions: Some products may undergo chemical reactions spontaneously or due to interaction with external factors. These reactions can result in the generation of impurities. 6.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that certain lifestyle practices, including regular physical activity, sound nutrition, weight management, and abstaining from smoking, can significantly reduce the risk of CVD. Research conducted on large cohort studies has shown that individuals who adhere to a cluster of these lifestyle practices experience a substantial reduction in the risk of CVD by more than 80% and a reduction of diabetes risk by over 90%. These findings have given rise to the field of \\"lifestyle medicine,\\" focusing on the impact of lifestyle factors on the prevention and management of CVD. Despite the overwhelming evidence supporting the influence of lifestyle on CVD risk, it is disheartening to note that a minority of individuals follow these practices. The American Heart Association estimates that only 5% of people incorporate all of these lifestyle factors into their daily routines as part of a comprehensive strategy to achieve optimal cardiovascular health. One of the primary challenges faced by the medical and healthcare communities is the urgent need to integrate this wealth of information into daily medical practices more aggressively. Professionals in these fields must actively promote and reinforce the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle to their patients, urging them to adopt practices such as engaging in regular exercise, consuming a balanced diet, managing their weight effectively, and refraining from smoking. To ensure successful adoption of these practices, healthcare providers should prioritize educational efforts, offering clear and concise guidance on the benefits of lifestyle changes and practical tips on how to incorporate them into daily routines. Implementing behavioral interventions and establishing patient support networks can also prove invaluable in helping individuals maintain their commitment to long-term lifestyle modifications. Furthermore, healthcare systems need to make these lifestyle interventions more accessible and affordable for everyone, irrespective of socioeconomic status. By leveraging community resources, implementing public health initiatives, and collaborating with policymakers, healthcare organizations can create environments that encourage and support healthy lifestyle choices. In conclusion, daily habits and actions have a profound influence on the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. While evidence overwhelmingly supports the benefits of lifestyle practices such as regular exercise, healthy eating, weight management, and not smoking, only a small fraction of individuals incorporate these practices into their lives. The medical and healthcare communities have a responsibility to more aggressively integrate this knowledge into daily medical practices, emphasizing the importance of lifestyle changes, and promoting accessible interventions to improve overall cardiovascular health."},{"prompt":"[Return just the main response.

God commanded Moses to take severe action against the leaders and the idolatrous people, including their execution. However, one Israelite man boldly brought a Midianite woman into his tent in front of Moses and the entire congregation. In response, Phinehas, the grandson of Aaron, witnessed this act and zealously killed both the man and the woman.

This position can vary depending on individual beliefs, philosophical frameworks, and cultural contexts. One possible pedagogical position is that of gender equality, which advocates for equal opportunities and treatment for all students, regardless of their gender identity. This position aims to challenge and dismantle traditional gender roles and stereotypes that can limit students' potential and perpetuate inequality. Educators who adopt a gender equality pedagogical position prioritize creating inclusive learning environments where all students feel respected and supported in expressing their authentic selves. They promote equitable access to educational resources, encourage students to pursue subjects and careers traditionally associated with the opposite gender, and provide opportunities for critical conversations about gender inequality and discrimination. Another possible pedagogical position is that of gender equity, which recognizes that individuals may have different needs and experiences based on their gender identities. This position emphasizes the importance of providing targeted support and resources to address specific challenges faced by marginalized genders. Those adopting a gender equity pedagogical position advocate for curricula and teaching practices that consider the unique perspectives and experiences of different genders. They aim to challenge systemic barriers and biases that disproportionately affect certain genders, such as the underrepresentation of women in STEM fields or the overrepresentation of boys in disciplinary issues. Educators in this position encourage students to engage in critical thinking and dialogue about gender-related issues and foster an understanding of the intersections between gender and other forms of oppression, including race, class, and sexuality. Ultimately, the choice of pedagogical position towards gender and education depends on educators' values, their understanding of the social and cultural contexts in which they operate, and their commitment to promoting a more inclusive and equitable learning environment. Each position aims to address gender-related inequalities but may focus on different aspects and employ varied strategies in pursuit of their goals."},{"prompt":"中国创业环境分析（经济环境、社会环境、政策环境）","completion":"中国的创业环境在经济、社会和政策环境方面都存在着一些特点和挑战。 经济环境： 1.快速增长的市场：中国拥有庞大的人口基数和不断增长的中产阶级，市场需求巨大。 2.投资机会多样化：中国的市场不仅涵盖了传统行业，也有日益壮大的新兴行业和技术领域。 3.资本供给：创业者可以通过公共和私人投资渠道获得资金支持。 4.竞争激烈：由于市场庞大且发展迅速，各个行业都面临着激烈的竞争。 社会环境： 1.创新意识的提高：近年来，创业和创新意识在中国得到了大力推动和鼓励。 2.创业精神的培养：越来越多的大学和培训机构开始注重培养创新和创业能力的普及。 3.人才储备：中国拥有庞大的高素质劳动力资源，提供了各种技能和专业背景的人才。 政策环境： 1.政府支持：中国政府推出了许多鼓励创业的政策，如设立创业基金和提供税收优惠等。 2.知识产权保护：中国政府加强了知识产权保护的力度，保护了创新者的权益。 3.准入壁垒：一些行业对外资和外商投资存在一定的准入障碍，对创业者可能造成一定的挑战。 然而，中国的创业环境也面临一些挑战，例如： 1.激烈的竞争：中国市场的竞争激烈，对创业者来说，市场份额的争夺难度较大。 2.融资难题：尽管中国的资本市场发展迅速，但对初创企业来说，融资仍然是一个挑战，特别是对于那些初期没有明显盈利的企业。 3.行政审批：中国的行政审批过程可能存在一些不确定性和繁琐的情况，对创业者来说会增加创业的时间和成本。 总的来说，中国创业环境具有巨大的潜力和优势，但也需要面对各种挑战。对创业者来说，了解并适应中国独特的创业环境是成功的关键。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

When the economy becomes highly financialized, it can lead to a hollowing out of the industrial base and outsourcing of jobs due to several reasons: 1. Profit Maximization: Financialization prioritizes short-term financial gains and shareholder value over long-term investment and productive activities. This leads to a shift towards financial activities, such as speculative trading, mergers and acquisitions, and the creation of complex financial products, which can be more lucrative than investing in the real economy. This diverts capital and resources away from industries and job creation. 2. Pressure for Immediate Returns: Financial markets often demand quick returns on investments, leading to reduced investment in long-term projects, research and development, and job creation. This pressure discourages companies from investing in productive activities or expanding their industrial base, as these may take time to generate profits. 3. Focus on Cost Reduction: Financialization promotes cost reduction strategies in order to maximize profits. As a result, companies seek to minimize expenses by relocating production and outsourcing jobs to countries with lower labor costs. This leads to the hollowing out of the industrial base in advanced economies, where manufacturing is progressively moved to emerging economies. 4. Shareholder Value Over Stakeholder Welfare: Financialization tends to prioritize the interests of shareholders above other stakeholders, such as employees and communities. This profit-oriented approach can result in job cuts, wage stagnation, and reduced investment in workforce development and training, further contributing to the erosion of the industrial base. 5. Financial Instability: Excessive financialization can also contribute to economic instability, such as the financial crisis of 2008. As financial institutions take on excessive risks and engage in speculative activities, they can trigger financial crises. During such crises, industries suffer due to reduced credit availability, resulting in bankruptcies, downsizing, and job losses. It's worth noting that financialization itself does not directly cause the hollowing out of the industrial base and outsourcing of jobs, but it creates a set of incentives and priorities that can lead to these outcomes."},{"prompt":"根据标准大气的规定，求气压分别为1000hPa、850hPa和500hPa处单位气压高度差","completion":"根据标准大气的规定，单位气压高度差为8.43 km。"},{"prompt":"请写出具体计算过程","completion":"根据气压高度差的计算公式，可以使用下述公式来计算单位气压高度差： Δh = (R/g) * ln(P1/P2) 其中，Δh表示单位气压高度差，R为气体常数，g为重力加速度，P1和P2分别表示两个压强值。 给定的情况如下： P1 = 1000 hPa P2 = 850 hPa 首先，将压强值转换为标准大气单位（Pa），并将重力加速度和气体常数的数值代入公式中： P1 = 1000 hPa * 100 Pa/hPa = 100000 Pa P2 = 850 hPa * 100 Pa/hPa = 85000 Pa g = 9.8 m/s^2 R = 287 J/(kg·K) 然后，将压强值代入公式中并计算单位气压高度差： Δh = (287/9.8) * ln(100000/85000) ≈ 8.43 km 因此，单位气压高度差约为8.43 km。"},{"prompt":"850hPa处呢","completion":"对于850 hPa处的单位气压高度差的计算，可以使用相同的计算公式： Δh = (R/g) * ln(P1/P2) 给定的情况如下： P1 = 850 hPa P2 = 500 hPa 首先，将压强值转换为标准大气单位（Pa），并将重力加速度和气体常数的数值代入公式中： P1 = 850 hPa * 100 Pa/hPa = 85000 Pa P2 = 500 hPa * 100 Pa/hPa = 50000 Pa g = 9.8 m/s^2 R = 287 J/(kg·K) 然后，将压强值代入公式中并计算单位气压高度差： Δh = (287/9.8) * ln(85000/50000) ≈ 2.79 km 因此，单位气压高度差约为2.79 km。"},{"prompt":"大气层的虚温为多少","completion":"大气层的虚温可通过以下公式计算： 虚温 = 温度 / (1 + (0.0065 * h)) 其中，温度为摄氏度，h为高度，单位为米。 虚温是在垂直上升过程中，空气被自然冷却后所达到的等温状态下的温度。它用于衡量大气中的对流和稳定性条件。 请指定您希望计算虚温的高度，并提供该高度处的温度。"},{"prompt":"虚温和压强的关系","completion":"虚温与压强之间并没有直接的数学关系。虚温是在垂直上升或下降过程中，空气受到自然冷却或加热后达到的等温状态下的温度。虚温与压强的关系是通过大气的垂直温度变化来确定的。 在标准大气模型中，大致假设大气层中的垂直温度变化是线性的，即温度随着高度的增加而逐渐下降。根据这个假设，虚温可以用来描述垂直上升或下降过程中空气的温度变化情况。 然而，虚温与压强之间的关系是复杂的，取决于大气的垂直温度剖面。因此，没有一个简单的数学公式可以用来直接计算虚温与压强之间的关系。"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.
