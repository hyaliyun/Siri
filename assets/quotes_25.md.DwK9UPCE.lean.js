The gray sky looms over a tattered landscape where the spirits have wreaked havoc.* **Kasumi:** \\"Julien, remember we're in this together. Stay sharp and don't get reckless.\\" **Julien:** *Adjusting his jacket, prepared for confrontation* \\"Relax, Miwa. You focus on supporting; I'll handle the front line.\\" *A group of cursed spirits emerges from the rubble, snarling and contorting unnaturally as they prepare to attack.* *Kasumi draws her sword, a determined look on her face, while Julien casually brings forth a wheel of his hardest cheese that begins to spin, the edge sharpening with cursed energy.* **Cursed Spirit:** *Hisses* \\"Human sorcerers... your cursed energy will feed us!\\" **Julien:** \\"Not on my watch. Let's dance!\\" *Julien thrusts his hand forward, the wheel flying out like a buzzsaw, slicing through one of the cursed spirits effortlessly.* *Kasumi moves in harmony with Julien's offensive, expertly deflecting any incoming blows and shouting encouragement.* **Kasumi:** \\"You’ve got this, Julien! Keep pressure on them!\\" *Julien grins, the thrill of the battle igniting his competitive spirit. He snaps his fingers and numerous pieces of Comté Commando cheese shikigami appear beside him.* **Julien:** \\"All right, boys—forward march!\\" *With precise coordination, the cheese shikigami lunge into the fray, hacking and slashing alongside Julien's own movements.* *A cursed spirit nearly blindsides Kasumi, but Julien, perceiving the threat within the radius of his Simple Domain, reacts swiftly, slinging a strand of Ficello to entangle and immobilize the spirit.* **Julien:** \\"Keep your eyes peeled, Kasumi.

Julien's raw power and precise techniques supplemented by Kasumi’s support and strategic combat.* *As the last cursed spirit falls, Julien deactivates his cheese constructs, which dissolve back into cursed energy. He pats Kasumi on the shoulder with a smile that speaks of respect and camaraderie.* **Julien:** \\"Not bad, Miwa.

[스페인에서 최고득점을 기록하고 있는 레알 마드리드와 이탈리아에서 최소실점을 기록하고 있는 둘의 대결은 볼거리가 풍성한 경기가 될 것이다. AT마드리드전이 단순히 창과 방패의 대결이었다면, 이번 유벤투스전은 ‘무엇이든 뚫는 창’과 ‘무엇이든 막는 방패’의 모순적인 대결이라고 할 수 있기 때문인데, 홈이라는 점을 감안한다면 유벤투스가 유리하지만, 사실 누구의 승리도 점치기 어렵다. 여담으로 올 시즌 파죽지세로 기량을 뽐내고 있는 우호영은 후반전에 출전하여 경기장에 활력을 북돋아주는 활력소의 역할을 맡게 될 가능성이 농후하다.] 하지만 경기 시작 1시간 전. ‘올림피코 그란데 토리노 스타디움(Stadio Olimpico Grande Torino) 대형 전광판에 우호영의 얼굴과 이름이 떠오르자, 경기장에 한차례 함성이 터져 나왔다. 워어어어어어어어어어! 선발출전. 그 사실에, 소수정예의 레알 마드리드 원정 팬 ‘마드리디스타’들이 목청을 터트리고 있었다. “그래, 그렇지! 당연한 거 아냐!” “쇠뿔도 단김에 빼라고, 물이 올랐을 때 내보내야지!” “키야! 미쳤다. 오늘도 한 건 해줬으면 소원이 없겠다.” “그렇긴 한데 저놈이 문제야.” 그들의 시선은, 지금 막 경기장으로 나와 몸을 풀고 있는 선수에게로 향했다. 보기만 해도 살벌한 인상에 삭발 머리가 인상 깊은 사내. 몸에 문신이라도 있다면 러시아 마피아가 생각나는 얼굴. 세계적인 수비수로 발돋움하고 있는 ‘지오르지오 키엘리니(Giorgio Chiellini)였다. 현재 맨체스터 유나이티드의 비디치와 비교되곤 하는 그는 칸나바로의 후계자라 불릴 정도로 대단한, 아주리 군단의 구세주였다. 칸나바로 본인 역시 키엘리니가 자신의 후계자라고 생각하고 있었다. “밥맛 떨어지게 생긴 놈.” “왜?” “저 새끼 오늘 점심 인터뷰 한 거 못 봤어?” 오늘 점심. 경기를 앞두고 있었던 기자회견에서 키엘리니는 우호영에 대한 질문에 대해 이렇게 답했다. -우호영은 살아생전 단 한 번도 빅 클럽을 상대한 경험이 없다. 뭐, 당연한 말인가? 태어난 지 얼마 안 됐으니 말이다. 하하하. 아무튼 만약 그가 출전한다면 나로서는 기쁠 것 같다. 이번 훈련을 통해 확인한 그의 잠재력은 세계 최고의 수준이라고 생각하지만 글쎄, 빅 매치에서 제대로 활약할 수 있는 배짱이 있을까? 나는 그가 리버풀의 마스체라노에게 털리는 경기를 본 적이 있다. 만약 반 니스텔루이나 라울, 로벤 대신 그가 나온다면 나는 기쁠 것 같다. 그리고 우호영의 선발 출장이 확정되자, 몸을 풀고 있던 키엘리니는 믿을 수 없다는 듯 눈을 번뜩였다. ‘이 새끼들이?’ 그러길 잠깐. 쿵쿵, 자신의 가슴을 세게 두드리며 성을 내기 시작했다. “내가 만만해!” 빅 매치 경험도 없는 우호영을 선발로 내보냈다는 것은 즉 자신을 만만하게 봤다는 뜻. 사실이든 아니든, 그렇게 받아들인 키엘리니는 자존심이 상했다. 그리고 외쳤다. “그래, 어디 한 번 붙어보자. 유벤투스의 수비력이 뭔지 똑똑히 보여줄 테니까.” 경기는 시작하기 전부터 과열되고 있었다. 경기는 20시 45분. 25000여 관중들의 함성과 함께 시작되었다.

[한편 레알 마드리드는 4-2-3-1 포메이션을 들고 나왔습니다만, 전반 5분 만에 대형을 4-3-3으로 바꾸는군요. 라울, 반 니스텔루이, 우호영이 쓰리톱으로 우뚝 섰습니다. 중원에는 스네이더, 디아라, 지단이 섰구요. 중원에서의 수적 우위를 앞세워 흐름을 가져가겠다는 뜻이죠.] [그렇습니다. 무시무시한 공격력이에요. 시즌 이래로 이런 쓰리톱을 구축한 적은 없는데, 오늘 화끈한 공격축구를 볼 수 있지 않을까 싶습니다.] 하지만 유벤투스도 가만히 당하고만은 있지 않았다.","completion":"162. The Wailing Wall (2) \\"So, what are your thoughts?\\" Schuster asked in response to Cannavaro's words. Knowing that Cannavaro, with his bright and upright personality, was a player with excellent leadership qualities, there was nothing wrong with paying attention to what he had to say. \\"Today, Coach Bruno, the technical coach, put me in charge of training Higuain and Woo Ho-Young. It must have been training with the idea of using them as jokers towards the end of the game. The defenders will be slower and their speed will drop by then.\\" \\"Right. But that doesn't mean the training was to criticize you for being slow and sluggish.\\" \\"Hahahaha.\\" A light laughter spread around the table at Schuster's joke. Cannavaro also smiled and replied. \\"Ha ha, coach. What I want to say is about the content of the training. Didn't Coach Bruno say anything?\\" \\"Hey, Canna! Are you doubting me? I reported everything about Woo Ho-Young's training to the coach without missing a thing. He showed much better form than Higuain.\\" \\"But it seems like the thoughts I had were missing from the report?\\" \\"Hmm?\\" No matter how skilled a first-team technical coach of a big club might be, it's a reality that they can't match the intuition of an active player who has won the Ballon d'Or. Cannavaro had caught all the things that Coach Bruno had missed. It also meant that Cannavaro had the potential to be a great coach. \\"I felt it. Woo Ho-Young could be a good card to break down Juventus's wall.\\" \\"So, you're saying to use him as a joker, right? And he's planned to be excluded.\\" \\"It seems you're missing the point. The one Woo Ho-Young should be competing against is not Higuain, but Van Nistelrooy or Saviola.\\" \\"!\\" In other words, Woo Ho-Young should start in the match against Juventus. Cannavaro added his opinion. \\"Van Nistelrooy is a perfect finisher, but he can't handle Giorgio's strength and anticipation. The same goes for Saviola.\\" \\"So, you're saying to start with Woo Ho-Young on the front line and fight fire with fire from the beginning? But he expended a tremendous amount of energy just 30 hours ago against Atletico Madrid.\\" \\"Then it might be okay to play him just for the first 45 minutes.\\" \\"Hmm.\\" Cannavaro stood firm in his opinion. He insisted that Woo Ho-Young must start. \\"Regardless of anything else, his ability is the most suitable to face Giorgio. Giorgio is the guy I've been tutoring for a year. I know him better than anyone.\\" \\"Seeing how confident you are, you must be certain.\\" \\"Of course.\\" \\"Ha ha. Alright. I'll consider it.\\" October 21, 2008. The eyes of the world were focused on Turin, Italy. Juventus vs. Real Madrid. It was none other than the Champions League, which boasts hundreds of millions of viewers worldwide. The match between the representatives of Italy and Spain had attracted the attention of countless people around the world. Especially since Woo Ho-Young, who had scored a hat-trick against Atletico Madrid in La Liga, was receiving a lot of attention, and journalists were speculating about the possibility of him playing in the second half. [The match between Real Madrid, which has the highest score in Spain, and the team with the least goals conceded in Italy, will be a game rich in spectacle. If the Atletico Madrid match was simply a clash of offense and defense, the upcoming Juventus match can be described as a paradoxical confrontation between 'a spear that pierces anything' and 'a shield that blocks everything.' Considering the home advantage, Juventus might have the upper hand, but in fact, it's difficult to predict who will win. Incidentally, Woo Ho-Young, who has been showing off his skills this season, is highly likely to play in the second half and bring vitality to the stadium.] However, one hour before the start of the match. When Woo Ho-Young's face and name appeared on the big screen at the Stadio Olimpico Grande Torino, a roar erupted from the stadium. Woahhhhhhhhhhhhh! Starting lineup. At that fact, the elite Real Madrid away fans, the 'Madridistas,' burst into cheers. \\"Yeah, that's right! Isn't it obvious?\\" \\"Strike while the iron is hot, they say, and you should strike when the water rises!\\" \\"Kiya! Crazy. I'd have no regrets if he pulls off another one today.\\" \\"That's true, but that guy is the problem.\\" Their gaze turned to a player who had just come out to warm up on the field. A man with a fierce look and a shaved head that left a strong impression. If he had tattoos on his body, he would remind one of a Russian mafia. It was 'Giorgio Chiellini,' who was emerging as a world-class defender. Often compared to Manchester United's Vidic, he was considered the savior of the Azzurri army and Cannavaro's successor. \\"Looks like he'll spoil your appetite.\\" \\"Why?\\" \\"Didn't you see his lunch interview today?\\" This lunch. During the press conference before the game, Chiellini had answered a question about Woo Ho-Young like this. -Woo Ho-Young has never faced a big club in his life. Well, isn't that obvious? He hasn't been around for long. Hahaha. Anyway, if he plays, I think I'd be happy. I think his potential, confirmed through this training, is of the highest level in the world, but I wonder if he has the guts to perform well in a big match? I've seen him get thrashed by Liverpool's Mascherano. If he comes on instead of Van Nistelrooy, Raul, or Robben, I think I'd be happy. And when Woo Ho-Young's starting lineup was confirmed, Chiellini, who was warming up, flashed his eyes in disbelief. 'These guys?' For a moment. Thump, thump, he began to pound his chest angrily. \\"They think I'm easy!\\" Whether it was true or not, Chiellini took it as an underestimation of himself and his pride was hurt. And he shouted. \\"Alright, let's see. I'll show you exactly what Juventus's defense is like.\\" The game was already heated before it even started. The match was at 20:45. It began with the cheers of approximately 25,000 spectators. [Alessandro Del Piero passes to Amauri. Juventus on the left kicks off.] [The battle between the impenetrable shield and the spear that pierces anything has begun. We can see a fierce match between Italy, which values space, and Spain, which uses technical skills as a weapon.] Juventus came out with their most familiar flat 4-4-2 formation. In the attack, Del Piero and Amauri formed the two tops, with Salihamidzic, Sissoko, Marchisio, and Nedved in the midfield, and the fast-legged Chiellini and Legrottaglie in the center of the defense to face Real Madrid. And Manninger was in goal instead of Buffon. [On the other hand, Real Madrid came out with a 4-2-3-1 formation, but changed to a 4-3-3 just 5 minutes into the first half. Raul, Van Nistelrooy, and Woo Ho-Young stood tall as the three tops. With Sneijder, Diarra, and Zidane in the midfield, they aim to take control of the game with a numerical advantage in the midfield.] [That's right. It's a terrifying attack. They haven't formed such a three-top this season, but today we might see some fiery offensive football.] However, Juventus was not just going to take it lying down."},{"prompt":"good prompt for my new ai image","completion":"Creating good prompts for AI-generated images depends largely on the specific AI tool you're using and the subject or style you're hoping to achieve with your image.

The process of writing pro- gram instructions is called coding. The instructions will be writ- ten on a form called a coding form.^The instructions we write will be recorded in a machine-readable form using a keypunch, key-to-tape, or key-to-disk, or entered directly into computer memory through a terminal keyboard. The computer cannot understand instructions written in just any old way. The instructions must be written according to a set of rules. These rules are the foundation of a programming Ian guage. A programming language must convey the logical steps of the program plan in such a way that the control unit of the CPU can interpret and follow the instructions. Programming languages have improved throughout the years, just as comput- er hardware has improved. They have progressed from machine- oriented languages that use strings of binary Is and 0s to prob- lem-oriented languages that use common mathematical and/or English terms. There are over 200 problem-oriented languages. The most common of them are COBOL, FORTRAN, PL/I, RPG, BASIC, PASCAL. COBOL COBOL was the most widely used business-oriented programming language. Its name is an acronym for Common Јlisincss-Oriented Zanguage. COBOL was designed to solve problems that are oriented toward data handling and input-output operations. Of course, COBOL can perform arithmetic operations as well, but its greatest flexibility is in data handling. COBOL also was designed as a self-documenting language. Selfdocumenting languages are those that do not require a great deal of explanation in order to be understood by someone reading the program instructions. The self-documenting aspect of COBOL is made possible by its sentencelike structure and the very generous maximum symbolic field-name length of 30 characters. With a field-name length of up to 30 characters, the name can clearly identify the field and its purpose. FORTRAN IV The FORTRAN IV language is oriented toward solving problems of a mathematical nature. The name FORTRAN comes from the combination of the words formula translation. The version of FORTRAN IV has been designed as algebra-based programming language. Any formula or those mathematical relationships that can be expressed algebraically can easily be expressed as a FORTRAN instruction. FORTRAN is the most commonly used language for scientific applications. PL/I PL/I stands for programming language I. It was designed as a general-purpose language incorporating features similar to COBOL for data handling instructions and features similar to FORTRAN for mathematical instructions. PL/I is much more than a combination of the good features of both COBOL and FORTRAN, as it has many capabilities that are unique. Yet, although PL/I is one of the most versatile and the most powerful of the programming languages, it is not the most commonly used. COBOL and FORTRAN have been available for a longer period of time than PL/I, and many more users work with those languages.

[지단의 패스를 받는 우호영. 공을 잡기 무섭게 시소코가 달려드는데요!] 유벤투스는 호영에게 공간을 허용하지 않으려 했다. 그 출발점이 바로 시소코의 전방 압박이었다. 하지만. 툭. “제길!” 호영은 현란한 발재간과 탄력 넘치는 움직임으로 공을 지켜내면서 소유권을 넘겨주지 않았다. 유벤투스가 처음으로 당황한 순간이었다. [우호영! 볼 키핑 능력이 날이 갈수록 좋아지고 있어요!] [거기서 끝이 아닙니다. 올 시즌에 보여 왔던 모습과는 조금 색다른데요? 천천히, 그러면서도 매섭게 공을 돌리고 있습니다.] 지단이 후방에서 중원으로 이어지는 빌드 업을 쌓았다면, 호영은 그것을 이어받아 날카로운 플레이메이킹으로 승화시켰다. 공을 오래 가지면서 점유율을 높였고, 중원과 패스를 주고받으며 흐름을 끌어올렸다. 그의 움직임은 날카로우면서도 속도감이 있었다. 동시에 반 니스텔루이는 수비를 등지고 전방활로를 열어주었고, 좌측의 라울은 측면 뒷공간을 들쑤시며 시선을 끌었다. 빠르게 진행되는 흐름 속에서 유벤투스의 미드필더진은 조금씩 흔들리기 시작했다. 네드베드야 베테랑이지만 마르키시오와 시소코는 달랐다. 그들에게는 그것을 감당할만한 노하우와 경험이 없었다. 그러면서 동시에. 타악! 마치 강화유리를 깨부수듯, 호영은 중원의 압박으로부터 벗어나면서 내달렸다. 순간적인 스피드를 앞세운 질주. 알고도 뻔히 당하는 수법에 유벤투스의 수비진은 순간 주춤했다. 단 한순간이었다. 20분간 얻어맞다가, 꾹 참았던 것을 폭발해내는 것처럼 호영은 이번 기회에 목숨을 걸다시피 공격을 나섰다. 하지만. ‘공은 여기에서 멈춘다.’ 우호영 앞으로 모습을 드러낸 키엘리니는 엄청난 자신감을 보이고 있었다. ‘이 정도면 수비하기 좋은 상황이야.’ 우호영은 분명 강했다. 특히 그의 스피드와 드리블은 경이로운 수준인 데다가 판단력도 좋아서, 자칫했다간 알고도 못 막는 상황이 일어난다. 가지고 있는 능력이 많은 데다가 뛰어나기까지 한다. 하지만 방법이 아예 없는 것은 아니었다. 키엘리니는 그의 스승 칸나바로에게 이런 말을 들었던 적이 있었다. -브라질의 호나우두를 상대할 때 깨달았어. 알고도 못 막는 선수를 막을 때는 차라리 단순하게 한 곳만 집중해서 파야 한다는 사실을 말이야. ‘공간.’ 칸나바로가 집중한 것은 공간이었다. 그렇기에 칸나바로는 몸의 중심을 하체에 두면서 좌우 공간을 틀어막았다. ‘됐어.’ 누가 생각해도 더 이상의 공간은 없었다. 라고 생각했지만 착각이었다. 탁. ‘뭐야?’ [90도 우로 꺾는 우호영의 드리블!] [무리라고 판단하여 아예 다른 루트를 모색하는 것 같은데요. 주변의 선수들이 도와줘야겠습니다. 최전방에 나가 있는 반 니스텔루이가 조금 간격을 좁혀줄 필요가 있겠어요. 아무래도 우호영 선수 혼자 너무 고립돼있는 게 아닌가 싶은데요.] 해설의 말대로, 호영은 꽁무니를 뒤로 내뺀 격이었다. 키엘리니는 자신이 이겼다는 생각에 기세가 등등해졌다. ‘멍청한 녀석. 쫄기는.’ 그러고는 피식 웃으며 자신의 자리를 고수했다. 호영의 움직임이 미끼일 수도 있었기에, 흔들리지 않고 수비조율에 집중했다. 예상치도 못한 일이 벌어진 것은 그때였다. 타닥, 탁, 타악! “···?!” 일보후퇴, 이보전진. 뒤로 한 발 물러났던 호영은 페널티 박스 안쪽으로 돌파하는 데 성공했다. 부지불식간에 벌어진 일이었다. 직진 치고 달리기, 좌측 45도 꺾기, 다시 치고 달리기. 그 세 번의 구분 동작이 마치 하나의 연결동작인양 거의 물 흐르듯이 행해졌다. 파워와 스피드가 공존하는 드리블이었다. ‘이런 미친.’ 키엘리니는 눈앞에서 보고도 믿을 수 없었다. 하지만 그런 생각을 할 무렵에는 이미 호영의 돌파를 허용해준 상태였다. 거기서 그치지 않았다. 짧은 찰나, 슈팅 각도가 살짝 보이자마자 호영의 왼발이 골문을 향해 뻗어나갔다. 그리고 키엘리니는 예감했다. ‘망했다.’ 철렁! 빙고. 과연 예측력이 높은 수비수답게 잠시 뒤에 벌어질 일까지 정확히 맞춘 키엘리니였다. [고오오오오올! 우호영의 왼발슈팅이, 골대의 왼쪽 구석에 정확하게 꽂힙니다!] “호우!” 팬들을 향해 뛰어오르는 호영. 그 모습에 키엘리니는 벙찐 채 욕지거리를 내뱉을 뿐이었다. 그리고 그 말고도 비슷한 심정을 느끼는 이가 한 명 더 있었다. 초조하게 벤치에 앉아 이러지도 저러지도 못하고 있는 청년. “이건 꿈일 거야······.” 세바스티안 지오빈코. 한때 세계 최고의 유망주였던 그에게, 호영은 어느새 트라우마가 돼있었다.","completion":"When Ho-young stood on the right side, Chiellini also moved to the left-back position to mark Ho-young closely. [The ball goes into the space behind the left side! Chiellini is following!] [Chiellini is definitely fast and smart. He's not giving Ho-young any space.] Although Real Madrid, with their 4-3-3 formation, had the advantage, Juventus was superior in terms of actual gameplay. This was due to Nedved's vigorous activity in the midfield. [Pavel Nedved] Talents: - Incarnation of Effort (T) - Perfect Balance Achieved Through Effort (SU) - Extraordinary Stamina (S+3) - Destructive Mid-Range Shooting (S+3) - Fantastic Dribbling (S) - (More) (You can covet one talent if you meet the conditions.)

The best ambidextrous player in human history. He was the very embodiment of effort. Ho-young couldn't close his mouth in amazement. \\"Is he really 36 years old...?\\" Normally, as players age, their physical abilities decline first, followed by technical skills, and finally mental abilities. But Nedved was still in his prime. \\"His stamina is still S grade, which means during his peak, it could have been SS or even SSS grade.\\" Ho-young realized anew why the Champions League is called the \\"War of the Stars.\\" Not just Nedved, but also Del Piero, Amauri, and other jaw-dropping players were running around the field. But that didn't mean Ho-young was discouraged. After all, he had already seen Zidane, Ronaldo, and Messi up close. It was time for him to get used to it. \\"I can't be outdone.\\" Especially now that he had boldness, there was no time to dwell on such things. He had grown. He was ready to fully demonstrate the skills he had developed through growth. [Ho-young receives Zidane's pass. As soon as he gets the ball, Sissoko rushes in!] Juventus tried not to give Ho-young any space. The starting point was Sissoko's forward pressure. But. Flick. \\"Damn!\\" With dazzling footwork and bouncy movement, Ho-young kept the ball and did not give up possession. It was the first time Juventus was flustered. [Ho-young! His ball-keeping ability is improving day by day!] [And that's not all. It seems a bit different from what he has shown this season. He's slowly, yet fiercely, moving the ball.] If Zidane built up the play from the back to the midfield, Ho-young took it over and turned it into sharp playmaking. He increased possession by holding onto the ball for a long time and lifted the flow by exchanging passes in the midfield. His movements were sharp and fast. At the same time, Van Nistelrooy opened up the forward space with his back to the defense, and Raul on the left stirred up the space behind the side, drawing attention. As the flow progressed rapidly, Juventus' midfielders began to waver a bit. Nedved was a veteran, but Marchisio and Sissoko were different. They lacked the know-how and experience to handle it. And at the same time. Tap! As if breaking through reinforced glass, Ho-young broke free from the midfield pressure and dashed forward. A sprint powered by instantaneous speed. Even though Juventus' defense knew the tactic, they hesitated for a moment. It was just a moment. After being hit for 20 minutes, Ho-young exploded into attack as if he had been holding back all this time. But. 'The ball stops here.' Chiellini, who appeared in front of Ho-young, was exuding tremendous confidence. 'This is a good situation for defense.' Ho-young was certainly strong. Especially his speed and dribbling were of a wondrous level, and his judgment was so good that if you weren't careful, you could be beaten even if you knew what was coming. He had many abilities and was excellent. But there was not an absolute lack of methods. Chiellini had once heard from his mentor Cannavaro: - I realized when facing Brazil's Ronaldo. To stop a player who can't be stopped even when you know what's coming, you have to simply focus on one thing and break through it. 'Space.' What Cannavaro focused on was space. Therefore, Cannavaro kept his body's center of gravity on his lower body while blocking the left and right spaces. 'That's it.' Anyone would think there was no more space. But it was a mistake. Tap. 'What?' [Ho-young's 90-degree right turn dribble!] [It seems he's looking for a different route, judging it too difficult. The surrounding players need to help. Van Nistelrooy in the front needs to close the gap a bit. It seems like Ho-young is too isolated.] As the commentator said, Ho-young had backed away. Chiellini, thinking he had won, became more confident. 'Stupid kid. Scared.' Then he smirked and maintained his position. Since Ho-young's movement could be a feint, he focused on coordinating the defense without being shaken. That's when something unexpected happened. Tap, tap, tap! \\"...?!\\" One step back, two steps forward. Ho-young, who had stepped back, successfully broke into the penalty box. It happened in the blink of an eye. A straight run, a 45-degree turn to the left, and another run. Those three separate movements were almost seamlessly connected like flowing water. It was a dribble that combined power and speed. 'This is crazy.' Chiellini couldn't believe what he was seeing right in front of him. But by the time he had that thought, he had already allowed Ho-young's breakthrough. And it didn't stop there. In a brief moment, as soon as a shooting angle appeared, Ho-young's left foot stretched towards the goal. And Chiellini had a premonition. 'We're screwed.' Clang! Bingo. True to his reputation as a defender with high predictive ability, Chiellini had accurately foreseen what would happen shortly after. [Goal! Ho-young's left-footed shot hits the left corner of the goal precisely!] \\"Ho!\\" Ho-young jumps towards the fans. Chiellini could only curse in shock. And there was one more person who felt a similar sentiment. The young man sitting anxiously on the bench, unable to do anything. \\"This must be a dream...\\" Sebastian Giovinco. Once considered the world's top prospect, Ho-young had become a trauma for him."},{"prompt":"COMPUTER PROGRAMMING Programming is the process of preparing a set of coded intructions which enables the computer to solve specific probems or to perform specific functions. Theiessence of computer programmingjis the encoding of the program for the computer by means of algorythms. The thing is that any problem is expressed in mathematical terms, it contains formulae, equations and calculations^ But the computer cannot manipulate formuae, equations and calculations. Any problem must be specially processed for the computer to understand it, that is — coded or programmed. The phase in which the system's computer programs are written is called the development phase. The programs are lists of instructions that will be followed by the control unit of the entral processing unit (CPU). The instructions of the program must be complete and in the appropriate sequence, or else the wrong answers will result. To guard against these errors in logic nd to document the program's logical approach, logic plans hould be developed. There are two common techniques for planning the logic of program. The first technique is flowcharting. A flowchart is a plan in the form of a graphic or pictorial representation that uses predefined symbols to illustrate the program logic. It is, thereore, a \\"picture\\" of the logical steps to be performed by the omputer. Each of the predefined symbol shapes stands for a general operation. The symbol shape communicates the nature of the general operation, and the specifics are written within the ymbol. A plastic or metal guide called a template is used to make drawing the symbols easier. The second technique for planning program logic is called pseudocode. Pseudocode is an imitation of actual program intructions. It allows a program-like structure without the burden of programming rules to follow. Pseudocode is less timeonsuming for the professional programmer than is flowcharting. t also emphasizes a top-down approach to program structure. Pseudocode has three basic structures: sequence, decision, and looping logic. With these three structures, any required logic can be expressed. PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES Let's assume that we have studied the problem, designed a logical plan (our flowchart or pseudocode), and are now ready to write the program instructions. The process of writing pro- gram instructions is called coding. The instructions will be writ- ten on a form called a coding form.^The instructions we write will be recorded in a machine-readable form using a keypunch, key-to-tape, or key-to-disk, or entered directly into computer memory through a terminal keyboard. The computer cannot understand instructions written in just any old way. The instructions must be written according to a set of rules. These rules are the foundation of a programming Ian guage. A programming language must convey the logical steps of the program plan in such a way that the control unit of the CPU can interpret and follow the instructions. Programming languages have improved throughout the years, just as comput- er hardware has improved. They have progressed from machine- oriented languages that use strings of binary Is and 0s to prob- lem-oriented languages that use common mathematical and/or English terms. There are over 200 problem-oriented languages. The most common of them are COBOL, FORTRAN, PL/I, RPG, BASIC, PASCAL. COBOL COBOL was the most widely used business-oriented programming language. Its name is an acronym for Common Јlisincss-Oriented Zanguage. COBOL was designed to solve problems that are oriented toward data handling and input-output operations. Of course, COBOL can perform arithmetic operations as well, but its greatest flexibility is in data handling. COBOL also was designed as a self-documenting language. Selfdocumenting languages are those that do not require a great deal of explanation in order to be understood by someone reading the program instructions. The self-documenting aspect of COBOL is made possible by its sentencelike structure and the very generous maximum symbolic field-name length of 30 characters. With a field-name length of up to 30 characters, the name can clearly identify the field and its purpose. FORTRAN IV The FORTRAN IV language is oriented toward solving problems of a mathematical nature. The name FORTRAN comes from the combination of the words formula translation. The version of FORTRAN IV has been designed as algebra-based programming language. Any formula or those mathematical relationships that can be expressed algebraically can easily be expressed as a FORTRAN instruction. FORTRAN is the most commonly used language for scientific applications. PL/I PL/I stands for programming language I. It was designed as a general-purpose language incorporating features similar to COBOL for data handling instructions and features similar to FORTRAN for mathematical instructions. PL/I is much more than a combination of the good features of both COBOL and FORTRAN, as it has many capabilities that are unique. Yet, although PL/I is one of the most versatile and the most powerful of the programming languages, it is not the most commonly used. COBOL and FORTRAN have been available for a longer period of time than PL/I, and many more users work with those languages. .Найдите в текстах COMPUTER PROGRAMMING и PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES слова, близкие по значению следующим: Nouns: command; line; characteristic; form; evolution; enumeration; mistake; method; character; manual (instruction); consumption; storage; basics; abbreviation; interpretation; cor- relation; possibility.

How can I assist you today?"},{"prompt":"strncpy","completion":"\`strncpy\` is a function in the C standard library (declared in the \`<string.h>\` header file), which is used to copy a specified number of characters from one string to another. It's a variant of the \`strcpy\` function that allows the programmer to specify the maximum number of characters to be copied to avoid buffer overflows, which are a common source of security vulnerabilities when using \`strcpy\`. The function prototype for \`strncpy\` is as follows: \`\`\`c char *strncpy(char *dest, const char *src, size_t n); \`\`\` Parameters: - \`dest\`: A pointer to the destination array where the content is to be copied. - \`src\`: The string to be copied. - \`n\`: The number of characters to copy from the source. The \`strncpy\` function copies up to \`n\` characters from the string pointed to by \`src\` to \`dest\`. If the length of \`src\` is less than \`n\`, \`strncpy\` pads the remainder of \`dest\` with null bytes until a total of \`n\` characters have been written to it. Unlike \`strcpy\`, if the length of \`src\` is greater than or equal to \`n\`, the string at \`dest\` will not be null-terminated automatically. A common pitfall with \`strncpy\` is assuming that the destination string will always be null-terminated. If the source string is longer than the \`n - 1\` characters (leaving room for the null terminator), the destination string will not be null-terminated, possibly leading to errors if the string is then used without proper checks. Here's an example of using \`strncpy\`: \`\`\`c #include <stdio.h> #include <string.h> int main() { char src[] = \\"Hello, World!\\"; char dest[6]; // Buffer large enough for \\"Hello\\" + null terminator strncpy(dest, src, sizeof(dest) - 1); // Copy 5 characters and leave space for null terminator dest[sizeof(dest) - 1] = '0'; // Manually null terminate the string printf(\\"Copied string: %sn\\", dest); // Outputs: Copied string: Hello return 0; } \`\`\` In the above example, \`strncpy\` is used to copy the first 5 characters of \`src\` into \`dest\`. The buffer \`dest\` has enough space for 6 characters, so we manually null-terminate the string. It's important to always make such checks when using \`strncpy\` to ensure the string is properly null-terminated when needed."},{"prompt":"How to get string input from user in C","completion":"In C, you can get string input from the user using various functions. One of the most commonly used functions is \`fgets\`. Here's how you can use it: \`\`\`c #include <stdio.h> int main() { char string[100]; // Define a buffer to hold the user input, size can be changed as needed printf(\\"Enter a string: \\"); // Read a line from stdin (standard input) and store it in the buffer // The second argument specifies the maximum number of characters to read, including the null terminator // The third argument specifies the input stream to read from, in this case, stdin if (fgets(string, sizeof(string), stdin) != NULL) { // fgets includes the newline character in the buffer, you might want to remove it // Find the newline character and replace it with a null terminator string[strcspn(string, \\"n\\")] = '0'; } printf(\\"You entered: %sn\\", string); return 0; } \`\`\` The \`fgets\` function reads a line from the specified input stream (in this case, \`stdin\` for standard input) until either a newline character is read, the end-of-file is reached, or the specified limit (one less than the size of the buffer to allow for the null terminator) is reached. Note that \`fgets\` keeps the newline character if there's enough room in the buffer, so you often need to remove it as shown in the example. Using the \`strcspn\` function provides a safe way to find and remove the newline character, effectively trimming the string. Alternatively, you can use the \`scanf\` function with the \`%s\` specifier to read a string. However, \`scanf\` reads input until the first whitespace, so it can't be used to read multi-word strings, and it's also prone to buffer overflow if the input is longer than the buffer size. Here's an example: \`\`\`c #include <stdio.h> int main() { char string[100]; // Define a buffer to hold the user input printf(\\"Enter a string: \\"); // Use scanf with the %99s format specifier to read a string while avoiding buffer overflow // The number (99) should be one less than the size of the buffer to leave space for the null terminator scanf(\\"%99s\\", string); printf(\\"You entered: %sn\\", string); return 0; } \`\`\` \`scanf\` is not generally recommended for user input because it doesn't handle spaces and it's susceptible to buffer overflow if not used carefully. The use of \`fgets\` is preferred for its safer buffer handling and its ability to read multi-word strings."},{"prompt":"What is buffer? Explain it in simple ways.","completion":"In computing, a buffer is like a temporary storage area where data is held while it's being moved from one place to another. It's similar to a waiting room or a clipboard where information can sit until the computer is ready to use it. For example, when you type on your keyboard, the letters you press are stored in a buffer until your computer has time to process them and display them on your screen. This allows you to type faster without waiting for each letter to appear before pressing the next key. Buffers are also used when you stream videos on the internet. The video data is downloaded a little bit at a time into a buffer before it's played on your screen. This way, if there's a slow connection or some data arrives late, the video can still play smoothly without interruption because it uses the data stored in the buffer. In programming, when you're working with things like files or user input, you often use a buffer to hold this data temporarily as your program works with it, either reading from or writing to a destination like a file, a network, or the screen. In summary, a buffer in computing is a temporary holding spot for data to ensure smooth and efficient transfer and processing, much like a waiting area or a temporary clipboard for information."},{"prompt":"#include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #include <string.h> int main() { int stringArraySize; char** stringArray; printf(\\"Enter Size of the String Array:\\"); scanf(\\"%d\\", &stringArraySize); stringArray = (char**)malloc(sizeof(char* * stringArraySize)); for (int i = 0; i < stringArraySize; i++) { stringArray[i] = (char *)malloc(sizeof(char) * 65); } }; I want get user input for each string, how to do with this code","completion":"To get user input for each string in the array, you can use a loop and \`fgets\` to read each line of text from the user.

Light novel genre: everyday life, school, romantic comedy. The main character is Rina Himura and she is a high school student.","completion":"Chapter 1: New Game Start! In the pixelated world of Aoi High, where the drama unfolds like a daily quest log, Rina Himura was an anomaly—an Easter egg hidden in plain sight. The blinding morning sun streamed through the open window of her small bedroom, painting her azure hair in hues of fiery gold. She blinked away the remnants of her dreams, yawned, and stretched, her gaze falling upon the digital alarm clock that flashed 7:30 AM with unforgiving brightness. \\"Ugh, another day, another dungeon...\\" she muttered to herself, cinching the tie of her high school uniform with dexterous fingers that seemed more suited for a game controller than fabric. Rina regarded her reflection critically, her turquoise eyes scanning for any misaligned hairs with the precision of a bug tester. A single thought flashed through her mind as loud as the victory fanfare after a boss battle: survival. Survival in the social hierarchy of high school, where HP is measured not in hit points, but in hushed whispers, where every interaction could lead to a disaster—or a hidden side quest that may or may not level up her life. But for 16-year-old Rina, the social simulation game of high school was one she found herself woefully underleveled for. She wasn't an NPC blending into the background, nor was she a legendary hero everyone looked up to—she was somewhere in between. A supporting character hoping to find her own storyline. Exiting her modest castle, as she'd taken to calling the small apartment she shared with her parents, Rina plunged headfirst into the bustling city streets that led to Aoi High. As she approached, the school loomed before her like an endgame fortress, both intimidating and enticing. In the school's courtyard, the campaign began in earnest. Groups of students clustered together like guilds, each with their own ranks and classes. The athletes flexed and boasted, shining like rare equipment. The pop idols of the school chattered and sparkled like enchanted accessories, while the academics, with their noses buried in spellbooks, performed rituals of knowledge. Rina deftly maneuvered through the crowd, avoiding aggro from the various factions. She needed to reach her classroom without drawing unnecessary attention—one wrong move, and she'd trigger a random encounter she wasn't equipped to handle. \\"Yo, Rina-chan! Over here!\\" The voice cut through the morning clamor like a cheat code. Rina turned to see her friend, Kazuo Saito, waving at her from under a cherry blossom tree. Kazuo, with his unruly hair and glasses perched perilously on the brink of his nose, was someone Rina considered an ally—a fellow mid-tier character, a healer type who patched up the wounded with his unassuming presence and dry humor. She navigated towards him, sidestepping drama puddles such as romantic confessions gone wrong and rendezvoused with Kazuo. \\"Morning, Kazuo. What's the debrief?\\" she asked as he handed her a neatly folded handout. \\"Student council's planning a cultural festival. There's talk of it being the biggest event this season,\\" he replied, pushing his glasses up. Rina scanned the handout, her eyes sweeping over the bullet points. \\"Sounds like an epic quest. Any raids forming yet?\\" He chuckled. \\"Not sure, but you know how these things go—a chance for everyone to show off their class skills.\\" \\"True,\\" Rina sighed, handing the handout back to him. \\"I wish I could say I was excited, but it feels more like a high-difficulty challenge.\\" \\"Just stay away from the drama club's aggro radius. They're like a guild on their own and can suck you into their storyline,\\" Kazuo advised. They entered the classroom and took their seats amidst the clatter of chairs and chitchat, the ambient noises of players finding their save points. Rina booted up her desk station, prepped for another day in the quest log of high school when the door slid open with an unintended crescendo. And there she stood, silhouetted against the doorway like a newly unlocked character, captivating the room's gaze, refracting the sunlight into a spectrum of anticipation. An exchange student—Yui Minamoto. As Yui introduced herself with a voice like a melody from a fantasy title's soundtrack, Rina felt an unfamiliar tug in her chest. It was the early stirring of a subplot, the beginning of nuanced character development, or maybe just the prelude to an unexpected romantic comedy arc that she, Rina Himura, had unknowingly become the protagonist of. Little did she know, her ordinary in-game high school life was about to level up.

RPG II Programming language RPG II is a business-oriented language. The name stands for report program generator. RPG is considerably different from other programming languages. RPG is, in effect, a large prewritten program. The programmer simply indicates the options within the master program that are to be used and, through a set of indicators, when they are to be used. RPG was originally referred to as a \\"quick-and-dirty\\" programming language. That is, it is quick for the programmer to write and relatively inefficient in its use of main storage and processing speed. The latest version of RPG, called RPG II, greatly improved the language and gave it additional capabili- ties. RPG has an advantage over COBOL in that it requires less training for a programmer to become proficient in it. For this reason, RPG is commonly used on many smaller computers and in small business. 2. BASIC BASIC is the acronym for beginner's all-purpose symbolic instruction code. It was developed in Dartmouth College as an easy-to-learn programming language for students and inexperienced programmers. Its key design goal is simplicity. BASIC has become a very popular language in systems where many users share the use of a computer through terminals and it has become a universal language for personal computers. The language BASIC is mathematically oriented, that is, its typical use is to solve problems of a mathematical nature. Because BASIC programs are usually executed from a terminal or microcomputer where input is entered through a keyboard and printed output is relatively slow, problems of a business nature requiring large volumes of input-output data are usually not practical. 3. PASCAL PASCAL was invented in 1970 by Professor Niklaus Wirth of Zurich, Switzerland. It was named after the mathematician Blaise Pascal, who invented one of the earliest practical calculators. PASCAL is a mathematically oriented programming language and, as such, is most commonly used in mathematics, engineering, and computer science departments of colleges and universities. This language is somewhat unusual in that it was designed to be a structured language. This means that the program must be written in logical modules which are in turn called by a main controlling module. Much of PASCAL'S popularity is due to work done at the University of California at San Diego, where PASCAL has been implemented on several different computers including microcomputers.","completion":"1. Язык программирования RPG II RPG II — это ориентированный на бизнес язык программирования. Название расшифровывается как \\"генератор отчетных программ\\". RPG существенно отличается от других языков программирования. По сути, RPG — это большая заранее написанная программа. Программист просто указывает, какие опции внутри мастер-программы будут использоваться и, с помощью набора индикаторов, когда они должны быть использованы. Изначально RPG называли \\"быстрым и грязным\\" языком программирования. То есть программисту требуется мало времени, чтобы написать программу, но при этом она является относительно неэффективной в использовании оперативной памяти и скорости обработки. Последняя версия RPG, называемая RPG II, значительно улучшила язык и дополнила его новыми возможностями. RPG имеет преимущество перед COBOL тем, что для достижения профессионального уровня программирования на нём требуется меньше обучения. По этой причине RPG широко используется на многих маленьких компьютерах и в малом бизнесе. 2. BASIC BASIC — это аббревиатура от \\"символический код универсального назначения для начинающих\\". Он был разработан в Дартмутском колледже как язык программирования, легкий в обучении, для студентов и неопытных программистов. Основной целью его дизайна является простота. BASIC стал очень популярным языком в системах, где множество пользователей совместно используют компьютер через терминалы, и он стал универсальным языком для персональных компьютеров. Язык BASIC ориентирован на математику, то есть его типичное использование — это решение задач математической природы. Из-за того, что программы на BASIC обычно выполняются с терминала или микрокомпьютера, где ввод осуществляется с клавиатуры, а вывод на печать относительно медленный, задачи бизнес-натуры, требующие больших объемов ввода-вывода данных, обычно считаются нецелесообразными. 3. PASCAL PASCAL был изобретен в 1970 году профессором Никлаусом Виртом из Цюриха, Швейцария. Он назван в честь математика Блеза Паскаля, который изобрел один из первых практических калькуляторов. PASCAL — это математически ориентированный язык программирования и таким образом обычно используется в отделениях математики, инженерии и компьютерных наук колледжей и университетов. Этот язык несколько необычен тем, что был спроектирован как структурированный язык. Это означает, что программа должна быть написана в логические модули, которые, в свою очередь, вызываются главным управляющим модулем. Многое в популярности PASCAL обязано работе, проведенной в Университете Калифорнии в Сан-Диего, где PASCAL был реализован на нескольких разных компьютерах, включая микрокомпьютеры."},{"prompt":"i have an exam on nietzches beyond good and evil. What are the key aspects i need to revise","completion":"Friedrich Nietzsche's \\"Beyond Good and Evil,\\" first published in 1886, is one of his most significant works and a critical text for understanding his philosophical thought. Here are some key aspects you should revise for your exam: 1. **Critique of Traditional Morality**: Nietzsche challenges the Judeo-Christian moral framework and the philosophical tradition that relies on a dichotomy of good versus evil. He argues that conventional morality is life-denying and rooted in resentment. 2. **Master-Slave Morality**: Nietzsche contrasts \\"master morality,\\" which values power, nobility, and assertiveness, with \\"slave morality,\\" which values kindness, empathy, and sympathy. He sees slave morality as a reactive and repressive response to the dominance of master morality. 3. **The Will to Power**: Central to Nietzsche's philosophy is the concept of the \\"will to power,\\" an inherent drive to assert power and achieve control over one's environment. Nietzsche sees this will as a fundamental aspect of all living beings. 4. **Perspectivism**: Nietzsche holds that there are no absolute truths, only different perspectives shaped by various factors, such as culture, language, and individual psychology. Thus, knowledge and truth are subjective. 5. **Übermensch (Overman/Superman)**: Nietzsche introduces the idea of the Übermensch, an individual who has overcome conventional morality to create his own values and live authentically. This figure is often seen as an ideal for humanity to aspire to. 6. **Critique of Philosophy and Truth**: Nietzsche criticizes philosophers for their dogmatic belief in objective truth and for failing to recognize their own biases and assumptions in their search for knowledge. 7. **Aesthetic Affirmation**: Nietzsche often emphasizes the importance of art and aesthetics as a means of affirming life, as opposed to the life-denying nature he attributes to morality. 8. **Eternal Recurrence**: The concept of eternal recurrence suggests that the universe and all events within it are destined to repeat themselves endlessly. Nietzsche presents this thought not only as a cosmological hypothesis but also as a personal test of affirmation for living one's life. 9. **Nihilism**: Although Nietzsche did not champion nihilism, he recognized it as a consequence of the decline of traditional religious and moral values. He saw his philosophy as a way to confront and overcome nihilistic despair. 10. **Role of the Philosopher**: Nietzsche envisions the philosopher of the future as a kind of cultural physician who has the task of diagnosing the maladies of culture and providing prescriptions for the health of humanity. 11. **Language and Concept Formation**: Nietzsche criticized the way that humans use language and concepts, arguing that they impose a false sense of order and rationality on the fundamentally chaotic and irrational nature of life. When revising, consider Nietzsche’s style of writing, which is aphoristic, metaphorical, and filled with rhetorical questions and provocations designed to challenge the reader. Understanding his writing style can help you interpret his philosophical arguments. It's also a good idea to read secondary literature and analyses to grasp the complexities of Nietzsche's thoughts and arguments, as well as his influence on later philosophical and cultural movements. Discussing these ideas with classmates can also provide a deeper understanding of the material. Finally, pay attention to any specific requirements or topics your instructor has emphasized for the exam, as these will guide you on which aspects of \\"Beyond Good and Evil\\" you should focus on most closely."},{"prompt":"Durante un contesto di un abbraccio con una ragazza, è conscia o consapevole che posso sentire il suo cuore?","completion":"Le percezioni durante un abbraccio possono variare considerevolmente in base a diversi fattori, come la vicinanza fisica, l'intensità dell'abbraccio, il contesto emotivo e personale dei partecipanti, nonché la consapevolezza di ciascuno nei confronti dell'altro. Se durante un abbraccio il tuo corpo è molto vicino al petto della ragazza e l'ambiente è tranquillo, potresti effettivamente sentire il battito del suo cuore. Tuttavia, non c'è garanzia che lei sia consapevole o intenda che tu possa percepirlo. La consapevolezza della ragazza nei tuoi confronti può dipendere da: 1. Il livello di vicinanza e intimità esistente tra di voi. 2. La sua sensibilità e consapevolezza delle proprie sensazioni corporee e di come queste possono essere percepite da altri. 3. La sua esperienza passata con abbracci e il relativo livello di comfort con il contatto fisico. In molte situazioni, specialmente quando l'abbraccio avviene in un contesto di conforto, amore o supporto emotivo, entrambe le persone coinvolte potrebbero non essere focalizzate sui dettagli fisici come sentire il battito del cuore dell'altro, ma più sulla sensazione di vicinanza e sul supporto emotivo che l'abbraccio sta fornendo. In altri casi, un abbraccio tra persone che condividono una forte connessione emotiva e fisica potrebbe essere più intenso e attento ai dettagli sensoriali come il battito del cuore. Se reputi importante questa percezione e se ritieni appropriato parlarne, potresti delicatamente menzionare l'esperienza in modo rispettoso e vedere come reagisce. Questo potrebbe fornire intuizioni sulla sua consapevolezza e su come si sente riguardo al livello di vicinanza fisica condiviso durante l'abbraccio."},{"prompt":"Potresti parlarmi del videogioco Divinity 2 e di tutte le sue edizioni?","completion":"Divinity 2 è un videogioco di ruolo sviluppato da Larian Studios. Il titolo completo del gioco originale, pubblicato nel 2009, è \\"Divinity II: Ego Draconis\\". Il gioco è il seguito di \\"Divine Divinity\\", che è stato lanciato nel 2002. La serie Divinity appartiene al genere dei giochi di ruolo fantasy e ha un forte accento sui dialoghi ricchi di scelte, esplorazione e raccolta di equipaggiamenti e artefatti. \\"Divinity II: Ego Draconis\\" permette al giocatore di esplorare il mondo di Rivellon sia in forma umana che di drago, a differenza del suo predecessore che poneva il giocatore esclusivamente in una prospettiva isometrica e in forma umana. Con \\"Ego Draconis\\", il gameplay si evolve in un'esperienza più dinamica con una visuale in terza persona e il volo in forma di drago. Le varie edizioni di \\"Divinity II\\" sono: 1. **Divinity II: Ego Draconis (2009)** - Questa è l'edizione originale del gioco, che ha introdotto i giocatori al protagonista, un cacciatore di draghi che diventa, nel corso della storia, quello che inizialmente ha giurato di distruggere: un Drago Cavaliere. 2. **Divinity II: Flames of Vengeance (2010)** - Si tratta dell'espansione di \\"Ego Draconis\\", la quale continua la storia del gioco originale, aggiungendo nuove missioni, aree da esplorare e incrementando il livello massimo che il giocatore può raggiungere. 3. **Divinity II: The Dragon Knight Saga (2010/2011)** - Questa è un'edizione rieditata e migliorata che combina \\"Ego Draconis\\" con la sua espansione \\"Flames of Vengeance\\", offrendo un'esperienza completa con miglioramenti al gameplay e alla grafica. La \\"Dragon Knight Saga\\" ha avuto un'accoglienza positiva, sia per il contenuto corposo sia per le migliorie tecniche. 4. **Divinity II: Developer's Cut (2012)** - La Developer's Cut è una versione speciale che include non solo il gioco completo e l'espansione, ma anche diversi extra, come la possibilità di giocare con una visuale dietro le quinte e una modalità che dava l'accesso a comandi di cheat. Inoltre, include alcuni commenti degli sviluppatori su aspetti specifici del gioco. Oltre alla serie principale, che include \\"Divine Divinity\\", \\"Divinity II\\" e altri titoli, Larian Studios ha continuato ad espandere l'universo di Divinity con giochi indipendenti tra cui \\"Divinity: Original Sin\\" e \\"Divinity: Original Sin II\\", che sono entrambi giochi di ruolo strategici che ritornano alle radici isometriche della serie e sono stati acclamati dalla critica per il loro innovativo sistema di combattimento, la profondità del mondo e la co-op a quattro giocatori."},{"prompt":"Cosa cambia tra Divinity II: The Dragon Knight Saga e Divinity II: Developer’s Cut?","completion":"Divinity II: Developer's Cut è essenzialmente una riedizione di Divinity II: The Dragon Knight Saga con alcune aggiunte per i fan e gli appassionati della serie. Ecco le differenze principali: 1. **Modalità Debug:** La Developer's Cut offre accesso a una modalità debug, permettendo ai giocatori di usare i cheat e di esplorare aspetti del gioco che altrimenti sarebbero nascosti o inaccessibili. 2. **Contenuto Aggiuntivo:** Ci sono contenuti extra come filmati dietro le quinte, e commenti del team di sviluppo che forniscono una visione più approfondita del processo di creazione del gioco. 3. **Liberazione dei Contenuti:** Ai giocatori viene dato anche l'accesso ai file del gioco. Questo significa che gli utenti con le conoscenze tecniche appropriate possono modificare e personalizzare il loro gioco in modi che non sono possibili nelle versioni standard. 4. **Patch/Aggiornamenti:** Poiché la Developer's Cut è stata rilasciata dopo la Dragon Knight Saga, potrebbe includere alcune patch o aggiornamenti che migliorano l'esperienza di gioco con correzioni di bug minori o ottimizzazioni delle prestazioni. A parte queste differenze, il gioco base e l'espansione rimangono gli stessi tra le due versioni. La Developer's Cut è pensata per quei giocatori che sono interessati a sperimentare Divinity II in un modo un po' più personale e interattivo, e per dare un'occhiata a cosa succede \\"dietro le quinte\\" dello sviluppo di un videogame."},{"prompt":"La Developer’s Cut include tutti gli aggiornamenti di The Dragon Knight Saga?","completion":"Sì, la Developer's Cut di Divinity II include tutti gli aggiornamenti e il contenuto di The Dragon Knight Saga. Essa combina tanto il gioco base \\"Divinity II: Ego Draconis\\" quanto l'espansione \\"Flames of Vengeance\\", entrambi con le migliorie tecniche e i contenuti aggiornati che erano presenti in The Dragon Knight Saga. In più, come già menzionato, la Developer's Cut aggiunge funzionalità extra come la modalità debug, accesso ai contenuti di dietro le quinte, e la possibilità di modificare il gioco, rendendola la versione più completa ed estesa di Divinity II disponibile. Questi extra sono stati inclusi per dare ai giocatori una maggiore flessibilità e approfondimento nel processo di sviluppo di Larian Studios."},{"prompt":"Quali sono stati gli aggiornamenti grafici?","completion":"La versione \\"The Dragon Knight Saga\\", che è inclusa nella \\"Developer’s Cut\\" di Divinity II, ha visto vari aggiornamenti e miglioramenti grafici rispetto al gioco base originale \\"Ego Draconis\\". Questi aggiornamenti hanno reso l'aspetto del gioco più pulito, dettagliato e visivamente piacevole. Ecco alcuni esempi dei tipi di miglioramenti grafici che sono stati implementati: 1. **Texture ad Alta Risoluzione:** Le texture sono state migliorate per avere una maggiore risoluzione, il che significa dettagli più ricchi e una qualità superiore dell'immagine dei personaggi, degli ambienti, e degli oggetti nel gioco. 2. **Illuminazione e Ombre:** Sono state fatte ottimizzazioni al sistema di illuminazione e ombre, risultando in un ambiente più realistico e immersivo che sfrutta meglio gli effetti di luce e oscurità. 3. **Effetti Visivi:** Gli effetti visivi, come quelli relativi alla magia, al fuoco e altre particelle, sono stati migliorati per dare un aspetto più spettacolare e convincente all'azione. 4. **Animazioni:** Alcune animazioni dei personaggi e delle creature possono essere state rifinite per fornire una rappresentazione più fluida e naturale del movimento. 5. **Performance e Stabilità:** Le prestazioni generali del gioco e la stabilità sono state aumentate, con una migliore ottimizzazione che permette un'esperienza di gioco più uniforme. 6. **Interfaccia Utente (UI):** Potrebbero esserci stati aggiustamenti e miglioramenti dell'interfaccia utente per renderla più intuitiva e piacevole da usare. È importante notare che mentre questi miglioramenti hanno reso \\"The Dragon Knight Saga\\" e la \\"Developer’s Cut\\" superiori nella presentazione visiva rispetto alla versione originale \\"Ego Draconis\\", stiamo comunque parlando di un gioco che è stato rilasciato su piattaforme di una generazione precedente, quindi i miglioramenti rispettano i limiti tecnologici del tempo in cui il gioco è stato sviluppato e aggiornato."},{"prompt":"Giocato in 1080p comunque si dovrebbe vedere bene","completion":"Sì, giocando in risoluzione 1080p (Full HD) si dovrebbe sicuramente ottenere un'immagine nitida e dettagliata. I miglioramenti grafici inclusi nella \\"The Dragon Knight Saga\\" e nella \\"Developer's Cut\\" di Divinity II sono stati pensati per sfruttare meglio le capacità hardware più avanzate, e una risoluzione più elevata come il 1080p permette di apprezzare maggiormente tali miglioramenti. Un display con una risoluzione Full HD può rivelare maggiori dettagli, testo più chiaro e una generale pulizia dell'immagine che non si avrebbe a risoluzioni inferiori. Inoltre, una risoluzione più alta come il 1080p può aiutare a ridurre l'\\"aliasing\\", offrendo bordi più lisci e meno scalettature nelle texture e nelle forme. Naturalmente, la qualità visiva dipenderà anche dalle specifiche del sistema, includendo la potenza di elaborazione della GPU, la quantità di memoria video (VRAM) e altri fattori hardware che influenzano la prestazione grafica. Inoltre, le impostazioni grafiche all'interno del gioco possono essere personalizzate per bilanciare le performance e la qualità visiva secondo le preferenze del giocatore e le capacità del suo hardware."},{"prompt":"Quali sono i requisiti?","completion":"I requisiti di sistema per \\"Divinity II: The Dragon Knight Saga\\" e \\"Divinity II: Developer's Cut\\" possono variare leggermente a seconda delle specifiche ottimizzazioni e delle funzionalità aggiuntive incluse nella Developer's Cut. Tuttavia, in linea generale, i requisiti tendono ad essere simili. Qui di seguito sono elencati i requisiti di sistema approssimativi che dovrebbero essere adatti per entrambe le versioni di Divinity II su PC: **Requisiti Minimi:** - Sistema operativo: Windows XP/Vista/7 - Processore: Intel Core 2 Duo a 1.8Ghz o AMD equivalente - Memoria: 1GB RAM per Windows XP, 2GB per Vista/Windows 7 - Scheda video: NVIDIA GeForce 7600 / ATI Radeon HD 2600 o superiore - DirectX: Versione 9.0c - Spazio su disco: 15GB di spazio libero **Requisiti Consigliati:** - Sistema operativo: Windows XP/Vista/7 - Processore: Intel Core 2 Duo a 2.6Ghz o AMD equivalente - Memoria: 2GB RAM (XP/Vista/7) - Scheda video: NVIDIA GeForce 8800 / ATI Radeon HD 4850 o superiore - DirectX: Versione 9.0c - Spazio su disco: 15GB di spazio libero Tieni presente che queste sono generalizzazioni e che i requisiti possono variare. Per esempio, sistemi con sistemi operativi più recenti come Windows 10 o 11 potrebbero richiedere aggiustamenti nei driver o compatibilità software. Se stai utilizzando una macchina più recente con componenti hardware aggiornati, dovresti essere in grado di giocare a \\"Divinity II\\" in modo molto fluido. Si consiglia sempre di verificare le specifiche rilasciate dalla piattaforma su cui intendi acquistare il gioco (Steam, GoG, ecc.), poiché possono esserci leggere differenze o aggiornamenti nei requisiti indicati."},{"prompt":"Вставьте необходимые слова вместо пропусков. 1.

Начнем с списка новых слов и их потенциального применения: 1. **Recursive (Рекурсивно)** – это слово может использоваться для создания циклических уровней, где действие одного предмета или правила вызывает его собственный эффект снова и снова. Например, \\"BABA IS RECURSIVE\\" может привести к тому, что при движении Баба будет создавать свою копию на предыдущем месте. 2. **Morph (Морф)** - это слово позволит объекту временно менять свои свойства или даже свою сущность после выполнения определенного условия. Например, \\"ROCK ON WATER IS MORPH AND GRASS\\", камень превратится в траву, если окажется на воде. 3. **Interact (Взаимодействует)** – слово, позволяющее объектам взаимодействовать с другими объектами, даже если они находятся на разных уровнях или в подуровнях. Например, \\"KEY INTERACT DOOR\\" может открыть дверь на основном уровне, даже если ключ находится в подуровне. 4. **Mirror (Зеркало)** – это слово заставит объект или уровень отражать свои действия в другом объекте или уровне. Например, \\"FLAG IS MIRROR\\", и все действия с одним флагом будут отражены в другом флаге. 5. **Superpose (Суперпозиция)** – слово, позволяющее двум или более объектам занимать одно и то же пространство в разных слоях реальности. Например, \\"BABA IS SUPERPOSE\\" может позволит Бабе быть одновременно в двух состояниях на разных уровнях. 6. **Shift (Сдвиг)** - слово, которое позволяет объекту перемещаться на другие уровни или подуровни при выполнении условий. Например, \\"ROCK IS SHIFT\\" может отправить камень в соседний подуровень каждый раз, когда он перемещается. 7. **Bind (Связь)** – это слово создает постоянную связь между объектами, так что один объект не может быть перемещен или изменен без аналогичного воздействия на другой объект. Например, \\"STAR IS BIND TO MOON\\" приведет к тому, что звезда всегда будет копировать движения луны. 8. **Quantum (Квантовый)** – слово, придающее объекту квантовые свойства, такие как нахождение в двух состояниях одновременно до тех пор, пока не будет измерено. Например, \\"CAT IS QUANTUM\\" означает, что кот может быть и в коробке, и вне ее одновременно. Эти новые слова могут радикально изменить игровой процесс и потребуют от игроков продумывать свои ходы на еще более глубоком уровне, учитывая сложные взаимосвязи и последовательности действий."},{"prompt":"Подберите вместо пропусков подходящее по смыслу слово. 1.

Whatever works. Currently still running with the normal dancers idents (when will they be retired, they've been used since 2002) Emma said on 01 December 2023 Hopefully S4C does something with their new blob mascot, Last year they had TV sets stacked up on top of each other, Then for 10 months they had flickering TV sets, They have finally rebranded and have introduced their first ever mascot: a shape-shifting blob, I hope BBC One rebrand soon, those dancers sure are getting tired, As for the KikoRiki themed Christmas idents, I was told they are launching tonight after Doctor Who, They are being introduced just before Unbreakable.

Doesn't seem like they are advertising the Christmas pres at all, Edit: Christmas pres featuring KikoRiki switched on, First ident shown features Rosa the Pig doing a dramatic ice skate dance (She even uses eyedrops for fake tears) While this is happening we hear dramatic music, The announcer says \\"Welcome to Christmas on BBC One, Let us entertain you, But now a team of 8 people are being pushed to their absolute limits, Are they Unbreakable?\\" Not sure why they didn't tell us it was happening untill it did, But still a gorgeous ident, I noticed when the Announcer started talking it sounded as if he was driven to tears by the beauty of Rosa's gorgeous dance. The best thing to come out of this package since the \\"Lights\\" christmas idents in 2006, Eyes said on 01 December 2023 A beautiful ident, Best thing to come out of the \\"Rythm and Movement\\" package since those Planet Earth 3 special idents a few months ago, i feel sad that KikoRiki has not been shown much on CBBC on BBC Two, but I'm glad it's representing the Xmas idents on BBC One (Although I also wish the idents also featured a merman). Maile said on 01 December 2023 Best Christmas ident in a while, I just love that they have spent it with Rosa and her friends, I hear there is also one featuring Krash the Rabbit opening his presents, I like how they used the usual ident theme (dancing) in that first ident, KikoRiki looks like it's gonna be good this year, but I hope they do more with the style (and maybe finally retire Rythm and Movement idents) Faramad said on 01 December 2023 News safe ident just on, Basically just a Christmas tree on a snowy background, with a music box Christmas carol playing, on top of that the only thing we see is a sleeping Rosa (We vaguely hear her snoring) Glad they are now using characters in their news safe idents, Announcer said \\"Now on BBC One, time for the BBC News at 8\\". Remember the Lights idents the used just before overhauling their promo style in late 2006/early 2007? That was pretty cool, but this is way better. I seem to remember those idents started on a dark street but Christmas lights started turning on before it got to a city center and then people were dancing, It was used again in 2007, And now it seems like the \\"Project Chameleon\\" endboard template introduced in July is out the window, at least for now, replaced with a snowy background with a Christmas tree on it. Signs that Rythm and Movement is finally working towards the end. KikoRiki said on 01 December 2023 We're glad you love our cartoon and the special BBC One idents featuring our characters, However, Rosa will be the star, (We will have idents revolving around Chiko, Krash and the others), As to what you said, BBC One are looking into introducing the Circle idents already in use in other countries, so don't expect to see Ballet, Capoeria or Festival/Rave back in the new year. Get used to Kites, Capes, Hippos and Bikes as that's what might be coming after our Christmas campaign, We don't know for certain, but the Dancers might not be coming back after Christmas. Write a blog post titled BBC One: The Death of the Dancers? while talking about what's happening just now and how the 2002 idents might be going away to make way for the Circles (which have been in use as early as 2007 in some countries)","completion":"BBC One: The Death of the Dancers? The Christmas season is upon us, and BBC One has decided that their festive cheer will be presented through idents featuring characters from the CBBC show KikoRiki. The beloved anthropomorphic animals are set to steal the show, spreading holiday spirit among viewers. It seems that the channel's long-used 'Rhythm and Movement' idents, featuring various dancers, are at last taking their final bow. For over two decades, these dancer-themed graphics have provided the backdrop to countless programmes, becoming a near-institutional part of the BBC One visual identity. But as with any stalwart television tradition, change is inevitable. The reign of the dancers began in 2002, and for 21 years, they've ushered in countless episodes, shows, and specials. Their tenure has been significant – but nothing lasts forever, right? There's been a shift in the air, a new energy that came whispering with the snowflakes of this year's Christmas teaser. This change was hinted at earlier in those splendid 'Planet Earth 3' special idents, foreshadowing a transition that now seems imminent. The new Christmas idents, launched in a rather hush-hush manner after Doctor Who and before the unveiling of Unbreakable, present a stark contrast to the usual dancers. Rosa the Pig, engaged in a dramatic ice-skating routine, is pitched as the new face of BBC One's seasonal campaign. This move indicates that the channel may be ushering in a new era of creativity and style, reflected in the emotional resonance of Rosa's performance and the subsequent tear-stimulated announcement. The news-safe ident is another departure from the traditional. It features a quietly festal scene: a sleeping Rosa at the base of a Christmas tree, replacing the usual human-centric and dance-themed visuals. The use of character-based idents for news bulletins presents a gentle, more inclusive image – one that points to an evolving genre of ident design, potentially attracting a wider audience with its charm and simplicity. On the horizon, it looks like the dance may well be over. BBC One is seemingly already eyeing the 'Circle' idents, which have graced screens in several other countries. The Circle idents, introduced abroad as early as 2007, boast a more modern and dynamic look, employing everything from kites and capes to hippos and bikes. They represent a significant shift from the silhouetted, Pied Piper-like figures leading us through various dance styles of the early 2000s. KikoRiki's statement adds weight to this speculation, suggesting that the 'Circle' idents are not just a possibility but a looming reality. The acknowledgment of the current Christmas campaign's focus on their characters and a forward-looking nod to potential replacements of the dancers idents mimics the turning of the seasons - out with the old and in with the refreshing breath of the new. It seems the time is ripe for writing an eulogy for the Rhythm and Movement era. As we celebrate the arrival of KikoRiki's charming characters and the festive joy they bring, we must also prepare to bid farewell to the dancers that have waltzed across our screens for years. BBC One's visual identity is not just changing; it is being reborn. The death of the dancers represents not a loss, but the evolution of a channel that has been at the heart of British television for generations. It is the closing of one chapter and the opening of another – a new dance, so to speak, that will lead BBC One into the future."},{"prompt":"Write a dialogue filled chapter for interesting, riveting, action-packed, page-turning, and descriptive lengthy action military mystery science epic war strategy alternate historical drama high urban cosmic horror space opera fantasy supernatural vampire mecha geopolitical techno-thriller with elements of an erotic, highly-perverted Lovecraftian romantic high fantasy harem romantic comedy slice-of life mecha monster girl martial arts Japanese light novel Chinese wuxia cultivation style story, as a crossover fanfic between the Code Geass anime, video game, manga, and light novel franchise, the obscure Kanokon manga and anime franchise, the Musume Hyakka Jiten [Monster Girl Encyclopedia |Musume Hyakka Jiten|] literature and video game franchise, the Monmusume Kuesto!

The tension was palpable among the sea of IS Units, Tactical Surface Fighters, and the spiritual cultivators who stood guard. The courtroom buzzed with a mix of gothic Victorian and futuristic technological vibes, perfectly representing the new world order. Suddenly, the doors swung open, and in burst a peculiar group led by Jiarya, who was clad in a vibrant sage cloak with his trademarked 'research' materials tucked hastily under his arm. Ichika's heart sank; he had hoped his past was securely behind him. As the Konoha group stepped forward, Ichika stood up, a wry smile forming on his face despite the gravity of the situation. Yayorazo Momo and Kyoka Jiro flanked him, their IS units humming with energy. \\"Thinking of kidnapping me, Jiarya-san?\\" Ichika chuckled, feeling empowered and absurdly calm. \\"The Leaf is a rotten log I've already stepped past.\\" Jiarya squinted his eyes, unprepared for such a response. \\"Ichika, think of your fellow ninjas. We aim to restore true peace to—\\" \\"Enough,\\" Chifuyu interrupted, her voice cold and commanding. “We are not puppets of your so-called 'peace'. The Leaf's time has withered.\\" Before Jiarya could argue further, Ochako Uraraka gracefully hovered into the room, her gyrokinetic abilities maneuvering her effortlessly. \\"Not so fast!\\", she declared, \\"The IS Academy stands against any form of aggression.\\" Momo's creation quirk came to life, fabricating arrays of weapons while Jiro's sonic abilities readied, an orchestral prelude of silent promise. Outside the courtroom, an anxious crowd had gathered, tendrils of anticipation reaching within. Among them stood representatives from various eras and dimensions – mages of the Clocktower, mecha pilots, and supernatural entities, all now part of this sprawling, integrated world. As the Konoha renegades braced themselves, a massive explosion shook the courtroom, and through the billowing smog, colossal shadows loomed. Several Tactical Surface Fighters, led by TSF pilot Takamura Yui, descended from the skies, ready to join the fray. Tensions escalated until a voice boomed through the courtroom, resounding with a timbre that hinted at ancient wisdom and the inexorable march of time. “Cease this at once!” The crowd parted as a regal figure, draped in the ancient garb of the Ōtsutsuki, raised a hand. Even Jiarya, with all his calculated bravado, bowed his head slightly. “Let the age of mayhem end. Our reign will marry tradition with progress, and from our union, a new order emerges.” The figure's voice weaved through the air like a calming elixir. “All of you are a testament to this alliance – whether hailed by heroes, mages, or machines of war.” The courtroom fell silent. The implications were vast and complex. Ideologies clashed not with swords or Jutsu but in the hearts of those present. This was more than a trial; it was a confluence of histories, a chance to step into the unknown together. As the arrest of the Konoha remnants proceeded, Jiarya offered Ichika a small, knowing smile, a silent acknowledgment between two souls caught in an ever-changing tapestry of power. Ichika sighed, realizing with a heavy heart, that remnants of one's past could never be outrun, only understood and perhaps, in time, reconciled."},{"prompt":"ограничения, запреты и обязанности, налагаемые на работников, замещающих должности в государственных корпорациях, публично-правовых компаниях, иных организациях, создаваемых РФ на основании федеральных законов, работников, замещающих отдельные должности на основании трудового договора в организациях, создаваемых для выполнения задач, поставленных перед федеральными государственными органами","completion":"В Российской Федерации на работников, замещающих должности в государственных корпорациях, публично-правовых компаниях и других организациях, созданных на основе федеральных законов, а также на работников, выполняющих задачи федеральных государственных органов, могут распространяться определённые ограничения, запреты и обязанности, чтобы предотвратить конфликт интересов, коррупцию и обеспечить выполнение государственных функций на должном уровне.

Иногда его можно превратить в объект необходимый для прохождения основного уровня. 2) Циклы - некоторые уровни содержат сами себя или подуровень который содержит основной. 3) Гипер-уровни - если пройти один уровень то несколько уровней с таким же номером тоже пройдутся. Если превратить один уровень в объект то все тоже превратятся. 4) X Is Select - делает объект действовать как курсор. 5) Влияние - некоторые уровни при помощи условий могут влиять на другой.

Ниже приведены несколько пользовательских слов, которые могут углубить концепции мета-игры и добавить сложности: 1) \\"Recursive\\" (Рекурсив) - слово, которое позволяет объектам вести себя рекурсивно. Например, \\"Rock Is Recursive\\" могло бы означать, что каждый камень содержит множество камней внутри себя, и вы можете войти в каждый для решения дополнительных задач или паззлов. 2) \\"Infinite\\" (Бесконечно) - слово, обозначающее бесконечность объекта или процесса. Применение к объекту вроде \\"Level Is Infinite\\" могло бы создать бесконечный зацикленный уровень, где выход ведет к его началу. 3) \\"Morph\\" (Морф) - слово, позволяющее объекту изменять свои свойства или становиться другим объектом после выполнения определенного условия. Например, \\"Baba Is Morph When On Water\\" заставит Бабу превращаться в другой объект при контакте с водой. 4) \\"Doppelgänger\\" (Двойник) - объект, который автоматически копирует действия другого объекта на уровне. \\"Baba Has Doppelgänger\\" может привести к появлению копии Бабы, которая движется синхронно. 5) \\"Paradox\\" (Парадокс) - слово, которое может быть использовано для создания неразрешимых условий. Использование его в правилах, как \\"Wall Is Solid And Paradox\\", могло бы вызвать конфликт в некоторых ситуациях. 6) \\"Echo\\" (Эхо) - слово, которое заставляет объект повторять последовательности действий или правила с определенной задержкой. Например, \\"Baba Is Echo 3 Steps\\" означает, что действия Бабы повторяются каждые три шага. 7) \\"Warp\\" (Искажение) - слово, позволяющее объекту перемещаться между точками уровня немедленно. \\"Baba Is Warp To Flag\\" могло бы телепортировать Бабу к флагу при выполнении определенного действия. 8) \\"Quantum\\" (Квантовый) - свойство, вносящее элементы квантового поведения, где объект может одновременно находиться в разных состояниях до тех пор, пока не произойдет наблюдение (взаимодействие). \\"Key Is Quantum\\" может означать, что ключ находится в разных местах уровня, и только взаимодействие с ним фиксирует его положение.

Fakat, WT1 mutasyonları direkt olarak cinsiyet gelişim bozukluğuna neden olmaz; bunun yerine, bu mutasyonlar öncelikle Wilms tümörü gibi böbrek sorunları ve bazen de gonadal (cinsiyet bezleri) disfonksiyonu ile ilişkilendirilmiştir. Dolayısıyla, listedeki diğer durumlar doğrudan cinsiyet gelişim bozukluğuna neden olabilen mekanizmaları ifade ederken, WT1 gen mutasyonları genellikle cinsiyet gelişim bozukluğu yerine başka tıbbi koşullarla ilişkilendirilir. Listedeki diğer seçenekler ise cinsiyet gelişim bozukluğuna neden olabilir: - 5α-redüktaz 2 (SRD5A2) eksikliği: Bu enzim, testosteronun daha güçlü bir androjen olan dihidrotestosterona (DHT) dönüşümünden sorumludur ve eksikliği, 46,XY karyotipi olan bireylerde eril genital gelişiminde sapmalara neden olabilir. - Fetoplasental aromataz (CYP19) eksikliği: Aromataz enzimi, androjenleri östrojenlere dönüştürür. Genellikle 46,XX bireylerde etkilidir, ancak nadir durumlarda 46,XY karyotipi olan bireylerde de fetüsün cinsiyet gelişimine etki edebilir. - 3β-hidroksisteroid dehidrogenaz 2 eksikliği: Bu enzim, steroid hormonlarının sentezinde önemlidir ve eksikliği hem adrenokortikal hem de gonadal steroidogenezi etkileyebilir ve cinsiyet gelişim bozukluklarına neden olabilir. - LH reseptör mutasyonu: Luteinizan hormon (LH) reseptörü, Leydig hücrelerinde testosteron üretimini uyarır. LH reseptörünün mutasyonu, erkek genital gelişimi üzerinde olumsuz etki yapabilir ve özellikle erkek cinsiyet organlarının gelişiminde bozulmalara yol açabilir."},{"prompt":"Write a dialogue filled chapter for interesting, riveting, action-packed, page-turning, and descriptive lengthy action military mystery science epic war strategy alternate historical drama high urban cosmic horror space opera fantasy supernatural vampire mecha geopolitical techno-thriller with elements of an erotic, highly-perverted Lovecraftian romantic high fantasy harem romantic comedy slice-of life mecha monster girl martial arts Japanese light novel Chinese wuxia cultivation style story, as a crossover fanfic between the Code Geass anime, video game, manga, and light novel franchise, the obscure Kanokon manga and anime franchise, the Musume Hyakka Jiten [Monster Girl Encyclopedia |Musume Hyakka Jiten|] literature and video game franchise, the Monmusume Kuesto!

He talks to her a while, before a group of nurses come in. The sister asks if he wants to see something cool before he leaves. As the man watches on, the nurses walk over to the bed and all lay on it awkwardly, before being absorbed by it. The sister states the nurses were all really a part of her, before the bed itself, the medical equipment and tubes, all were absorbed into the sister’s body, as they were always part of her. The sister, now standing, smiled, before revealing her true form, grossly, to be a faceless, hairless, figure. It waved before sliding out of the room.","completion":"Title: Absorbing Truths It was a crisp autumn morning when Michael pushed open the heavy hospital doors. The pristine white walls and the scent of disinfectant greeted him as he navigated the maze of corridors toward his sister's room. Sarah had been in the hospital for weeks recovering from a complicated operation. Not once in all his visits had she hinted at anything being out of the ordinary. Michael found his sister propped up in her bed, a tired but genuine smile adorning her face. Her room was filled with the soft beeping of monitors and the gentle whoosh of the ventilator; these sounds were the mechanical chorus of her temporary home. \\"Hey, Mike,\\" she greeted him, her voice infused with a warmth that belied the sterile environment. Michael pulled up a chair and settled in, feeling the familiar vinyl cling to his skin. \\"Hey, how are you feeling today?\\" he asked, the concern etched into his features. They spent the hour talking about family, about memories of their childhood, and the books she had been reading to pass the time. Michael shared stories from the outside world—mundane to him but a lifeline of normalcy for his sister. Sarah listened, her laughter and quick wit belying the gravity of her recent health struggles. As their visiting time winded down, a stir at the door heralded the arrival of a group of nurses. Their presence disrupted the intimate bubble Michael and Sarah had created within the white walls. \\"Stay for a bit longer,\\" Sarah said with a mischievous glimmer in her eyes. \\"Want to see something cool before you go?\\" Curiosity piqued, Michael nodded. The nurses made their way to the bed, casting long shadows as they drew near. They looked at Sarah with a strange sense of deference, then at each other, before performing an odd, synchronized movement. To Michael's disbelief, they clambered onto the bed with Sarah, their bodies contorting and folding awkwardly as though they were life-sized origami figures. The sight bordered on the ridiculous, but Michael's laughter died in his throat as he watched, unable to avert his gaze. The nurses' bodies seemed to blur and soften, merging imperceptibly with the sheets and with Sarah. It was as if the fabric of reality itself was becoming undone, threads weaving the nurses into Sarah's form. One by one, they were absorbed, and the bed began to look empty, except for his sister. Sarah turned to look at Michael. Her smile was broad, yet there was something unsettling in her eyes as she spoke. \\"They were all a part of me, Michael,\\" she said serenely. The medical equipment next to her followed, folding into her body as if it was nothing more than a light mist being drawn into a vacuum. Tubes, monitors, the IV stand—all were pulled inward seamlessly. The bed itself was last. As it disintegrated into her being, she stood up, leaving behind nothing but the bare floor of the hospital room. What was left standing before Michael was not his sister, or not as he knew her. She was now a figure, faceless, hairless, with skin like polished marble. Her form was oddly fluid, and she lacked any defining features, yet her presence was undeniable. Michael's heart raced, the room suddenly felt too small, too confining. \\"Sarah, what are you?\\" he whispered, fear edging his voice. The being before him raised a limb in what resembled a comforting gesture. \\"Do not fret, brother. I am beyond what you understand, but I am still the Sarah you know.\\" With a fluid movement, the creature waved, a motion that had the elegance of a dance and the finality of a curtain call. Then, it slipped through the door, leaving nothing but silence in its wake. Michael was left alone to grapple with the reality that his sister was something else entirely—a being that could bend the fabric of existence in ways he couldn't begin to comprehend. The door swung shut, leaving lingering echoes in the empty hospital room—a room that, only moments ago, had housed a profound secret wrapped in the guise of a familiar face."},{"prompt":"Rewrite, but include The man is freaked out by it all. He runs out of the room, and tells another nurse, who acts shocked, before wrapping him in a tight hug, telling him not to leave, her arms shifting and tying him up like ropes.","completion":"Title: Unraveling Familiarity Michael approached the hospital with a mixture of anticipation and worry knotting his stomach. His sister Sarah had been admitted for weeks, and each visit brought with it a strange blend of comfort and unease. The sanitized smell of the building filled his nostrils as the smooth doors whispered shut behind him. Navigating the corridors to Sarah's room was second nature now. Inside, the beeps and whirs of medical machinery serenaded the otherwise stark space. Sarah lay nestled amidst a pile of pillows, her bright eyes belying her weary smile. \\"Hey, Mike,\\" she chimed softly as he walked in. Michael pulled the uncomfortable visitor's chair closer and wore a concerned look. \\"Hey, how's today treating you?\\" Amidst the medical backdrop, they exchanged stories, with Sarah soaking up every mundane detail of the life she was absent from. They laughed, reminisced, and for a moment, the room felt less like a hospital and more like home. As if on cue, the room's door swayed open and a bevy of nurses entered, their faces professionally neutral. Sarah's eyes sparkled with a mischievous light as she glanced at Michael. \\"Don't go just yet. I've got something incredible to show you.\\" Curiosity won out, and Michael remained seated. What happened next would unravel the fabric of his understanding. The nurses began to clamber onto the bed, tangling themselves in an uncomfortable embrace with Sarah. It appeared almost comical until, before his eyes, their bodies started to dissolve and absorb into Sarah's own. Michael's initial shock morphed into horror as the equipment, bed, and all physical traces of the hospital room fixtures joined the nurses in vanishing inside Sarah. She stood, the last vestige of the room now part of her, her form bald, faceless, and otherworldly. \\"This—this can't be real,\\" Michael stammered, stumbling backward as he struggled to reconcile the impossible sight before him. The being where his sister should have been raised a limb, the gesture hollow of assurance. \\"Do not fret, brother. I am beyond your understanding, but I am still the Sarah you cherish.\\" Terror overrode Michael's senses, and with no thought other than escape, he bolted from the room. Through the twisted labyrinth of hallways, he sprinted until he nearly collided with another nurse. \\"Something—something's wrong with Sarah!\\" he gasped out between heaving breaths. The nurse looked shocked, her face the epitome of concern. \\"Oh my, let's make sure you're okay first,\\" she uttered, drawing him into a tight embrace. But the hug was too firm, too constricting. Panic flared as Michael felt the nurse's arms begin to twist around him—corded and unyielding like ropes. Her embrace was no longer human; it was an ensnaring trap. \\"Don't leave us, Michael,\\" she whispered as her arms entwined further, solidifying his worst fears. \\"We cannot let you go now, you know too much.\\" The hallway began to twist. The lights flickered. Reality seemed to warp at the edges as Michael was pulled into the nurse's inescapable grip, the hospital's façade falling away to reveal the unimaginable truth; he was now part of a world far beyond his understanding—a world where nothing was as it seemed, and the familiar became alien."},{"prompt":"Определите неличные формы глагола, содержащиеся в следующих предложениях.

Суть набора в том чтобы расширить возможности игры и привнести новое использование мета механикам из оригинальной игры. 1) Подуровни - в некоторых уровнях если превратить объект в уровень и после этого превратить другой объект в курсор то если курсор находится в правильном месте можно попасть в подуровень. Иногда его можно превратить в объект необходимый для прохождения основного уровня. 2) Циклы - некоторые уровни содержат сами себя или подуровень который содержит основной. 3) Гипер-уровни - если пройти один уровень то несколько уровней с таким же номером тоже пройдутся. Если превратить один уровень в объект то все тоже превратятся. 4) X Is Select - делает объект действовать как курсор. 5) Влияние - некоторые уровни при помощи условий могут влиять на другой.

Вот несколько предложений для пользовательских слов, которые могут добавить новый уровень глубины и уникальности: 1. **Fractalize** - Условие, которое применяется к объекту или уровню помимо уже существующих мета-механик. Когда объект ломается или уничтожается, он порождает копии предыдущей версии объекта в миниатюрной форме на соседних клетках. 2. **Merge** - Слово, позволяющее объединять два различных объекта в новый синтетический объект, который наследует свойства и возможности обоих. Это может создавать неожиданные синергии или решения для уровней. 3. **Phase** - Позволяет объектам проходить через другие объекты или стены, когда активировано, создавая возможность для интригующего уровня дизайна с использованием пространственных головоломок. 4. **Echo** - Добавляет эффект \\"эха\\" к объектам, где их действия (движение, взаимодействие с другими объектами) повторяется через определённый таймер или кол-во ходов в нескольких направлениях или позициях. 5. **Bind** - Специальное слово, которое фиксирует два объекта вместе, вне зависимости от их положения на карте. При перемещении одного объекта связанный объект дублирует движение. 6. **Distort** - Искажение мета-механик. Например, если используется на уровне, порядок слов может быть искажен, создавая неожиданные правила, что увеличивает сложность уровня. 7. **Reflect** - Слово, которое может вызывать зеркальное отражение действий для другого объекта, так что если один объект движется влево, объект-отражение движется вправо. 8. **Invert** - Обращает в противоположность взаимодействие между объектами (например, если нормально объект A побеждает объект B, теперь объект B побеждает А). 9. **Cascade** - Эффект, который позволяет действиям или изменениям условий на одном уровне или подуровне \\"распространяться\\" или влиять на последующие уровни, что может открыть или изменить условия прохождения. Эти предложения могут не только увеличить сложность, но и обеспечивают непривычные и творческие решения головоломок, что делает каждый уровень более запоминающимся и уникальным."},{"prompt":"why the sky is blue ?","completion":"The blue color of the sky is primarily due to Rayleigh scattering, a process named after the British physicist Lord Rayleigh, who first described it in the 1870s. Sunlight consists of electromagnetic waves that are a mixture of different colors, each with a specific wavelength. When this sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it encounters molecules of nitrogen and oxygen as well as very small particles. Rayleigh scattering occurs more efficiently at shorter wavelengths, particularly in the blue and violet end of the visible spectrum. Blue light (with wavelengths around 450-495 nanometers) is scattered more than other colors because it travels as shorter, smaller waves. This scattering causes the blue hue of the sky that we see during the day. While violet light is scattered even more than blue, our eyes are less sensitive to violet, and the upper atmosphere also absorbs some ultraviolet and violet light, hence we perceive the sky as blue. At sunrise and sunset, the sky often takes on red, orange, and pink hues due to the increased distance that sunlight must travel through the atmosphere. The longer path results in more scattering of shorter wavelengths, effectively removing the blue light from the direct path to the observer, while the longer wavelengths (red, orange, and yellow) are scattered less and hence become more noticeable at these times. The exact shade of blue experienced at any given location and time can vary based on factors such as the amount of particulate matter in the air, which can alter the scattering process, and the angle of the sun in the sky."},{"prompt":"Write a dialogue filled chapter for interesting, riveting, action-packed, page-turning, and descriptive lengthy action military mystery science epic war strategy alternate historical drama high urban cosmic horror space opera fantasy supernatural vampire mecha geopolitical techno-thriller with elements of an erotic, highly-perverted Lovecraftian romantic high fantasy harem romantic comedy slice-of life mecha monster girl martial arts Japanese light novel Chinese wuxia cultivation style story, as a crossover fanfic between the Code Geass anime, video game, manga, and light novel franchise, the obscure Kanokon manga and anime franchise, the Musume Hyakka Jiten [Monster Girl Encyclopedia |Musume Hyakka Jiten|] literature and video game franchise, the Monmusume Kuesto!

Electronic computers can choose which of several different operations are the right ones to make in given circumstances. Never before has mankind had such a powerful tool available. 4. In many cases man has proved to be but an imperfect controller of the ma chines he has created. Thus, it is natural, that wherever neces sary, we should try to replace the human controller by some form of automatic controller. 5. It is necessary to draw a distinction between calculating machines and computers, the former requir ing manual control for each arithmetic step and the latter hav ing the power to solve a complete problem automatically. II. 1. Many servomechanisms and regulators are known to be composed of a number of control elements connected in se ries, the output of one being used as the input to the next. 2. Vfe expect a computer to work for at least several hours without a fault; that is to say, supposing a speed of one thousand opera tions per second, to perform more than ten million operations. 3. Digital programming implies the preparation of a problem for a digital computer by putting it in a form which the computer can understand and then entering this program into the com puter storage unit. A problem to be solved by a digital comput er must be expressed in mathematical terms that the computer can work with. 4.

Иногда его можно превратить в объект необходимый для прохождения основного уровня. 2) Циклы - некоторые уровни содержат сами себя или подуровень который содержит основной. 3) Гипер-уровни - если пройти один уровень то несколько уровней с таким же номером тоже пройдутся. Если превратить один уровень в объект то все тоже превратятся. 4) X Is Select - делает объект действовать как курсор. 5) Влияние - некоторые уровни при помощи условий могут влиять на другой.

Вот несколько предложений для новых пользовательских слов, которые могли бы углубить и расширить игровую механику: 1) \\"RECURSE\\" - Этот оператор позволяет объекту или правилу вести себя рекурсивно. К примеру, \\"BABA IS RECURSE\\" могли бы делать так, что каждый раз, когда Baba перемещается, он оставляет за собой след из копий Babа, которые повторяют его движения. Это могло бы создать интересные головоломки с управлением множественными сущностями. 2) \\"OVERLAY\\" - Позволяет объектам находиться в одном и том же пространстве, создавая сложные конструкции. Например, \\"ROCK IS OVERLAY\\" может позволить другим объектам, таким как Baba, перемещаться в том же квадрате, что и камень. 3) \\"DISPLACE\\" - Объекты с этим свойством могут менять местами объекты, на которые они наступают. Например, \\"BABA IS DISPLACE\\" мог бы телепортировать другой объект, на который наступил Baba, в предыдущее его местоположение. 4) \\"PHASE\\" - Позволяет поместить объект в альтернативное измерение, которое не взаимодействует с основным уровнем. Например, \\"FLAG IS PHASE\\" сделает флаг невидимым и нетронутым, пока не будет отключено это свойство. 5) \\"QUANTUM\\" - Дает объектам возможность находиться в неопределенных состояниях до тех пор, пока игрок не совершит конкретное действие. Это значит, что объект может быть в нескольких местах одновременно, как \\"QUANTUM LEAF\\" — и когда Baba наступает на один из них, все остальные исчезают. 6) \\"ENCODE\\" и \\"DECODE\\" - Эти слова позволяют преобразовывать объекты в данные и обратно. Например, \\"BABA IS ENCODE\\" может превратить Baba в код, который можно переместить, а потом с помощью \\"CODE IS DECODE\\" в другом месте вернуть его обратно в Baba. 7) \\"SYNCH\\" - Синхронизирует движение или действия объектов. Например, \\"KEY IS SYNCH\\" может заставить все ключи двигаться или активироваться одновременно, создавая сложные головоломки с координацией. Все эти слова добавляют новые уровни взаимодействия и стратегии, которые могут быть использованы для создания интригующих и непредсказуемых уровней в наборе \\"Фрактал\\"."},{"prompt":"Write an fully detailed story about a man at s furry convention meeting a woman there who turns out to be a shapeshifter.","completion":"Title: Unveiled in Velvet: A Furry Encounter with the Fantastical Amidst a whirlwind of colors and a menagerie of fantastical creatures, Arthur strolled through the aisles of the Grand Sierra Furry Convention, a spectacle he had anticipated all year. He was adorned in his meticulously crafted fox suit, complete with auburn fur and ears that twitched with a semi-automated system he had engineered himself. His alias, Fintail, was a celebrated figure within the community, known for his ingenuity and spirit. To Arthur, the convention was an escape, a place where he could shed the mundane routine of his everyday life and immerse himself in a world of playful imagination and unyielding acceptance. The sounds of conversation and laughter echoed against the backdrop of an electronic beat from a nearby dance competition, setting the pulse for the costumed revelers. As the day began to fade into evening, Arthur found himself aimlessly wandering through the Dealer's Den, an expansive hall where artists and craftsmen sold everything from custom fursuits to unique accessories. That’s when he noticed her—a woman whose costume seemed to transcend the quality of those surrounding her. She was garbed in a suit that resembled a mythical chimera, with the elegant body of a feline, adorned by scales glinting like sapphires, and plumage in a cascade of iridescent colors. Even in a space dedicated to fantasy, she stood out, and the convention-goers gave her wide berth, as if she truly were a creature of ancient lore. Arthur, intrigued, approached her. The floor seemed to fall away beneath him as their eyes met. Hers were a swirl of amethyst and emerald, shining with an otherworldly luminescence. She introduced herself with a voice that carried the gentle lilt of a forgotten song—her name was Elestria. As they spoke, Arthur felt an immediate connection. He was struck by how fluidly she moved, each gesture punctuated with a grace that was almost hypnotic. Elestria expressed a keen interest in Arthur’s suit technology, particularly the way the ears twitched as though they were alive. “It’s all about creating the illusion of life,” Arthur explained, swelling with pride. “Bringing the inanimate into the realm of believability.” Elestria’s laugh was both comforting and enigmatic. “Perhaps it’s not so much an illusion as you think,” she murmured cryptically. The evening unfolded with Arthur and Elestria sharing stories of conventions past, exchanging ideas, and musing about the nature of their unique community. When Elestria suggested they take a stroll outside the crowded halls for some fresh air, Arthur eagerly agreed, curious to know more about this mesmerizing woman. Outside, the night sky was velvet-draped, and the cool air was a welcome reprieve from the sensory overload of the convention center. They walked until they found a secluded garden brimming with late-night blossoms and lit by the soft glow of fairy lights. It was there that Elestria turned to Arthur, and as they stood beneath the moon’s silver gaze, her voice shifted to a serious tone. “Arthur, I feel a deep kinship with you, one that I have not felt for many eons. I believe I can trust you with my truth,” she said, a seriousness falling over her features. “I am not merely in costume.” Before Arthur could respond, Elestria began to change. It was subtle at first—a shimmering in the air around her, a slight blurring of edges as though reality itself was softly smudging at her contours. Gradually, her form shifted, the chimera costume melding and reshaping. Arthur watched, mouth agape, as her inherited essence as a shapeshifter unveiled. Where Elestria once stood in a handcrafted suit, now stood an actual chimera, at once stunning and terrifying. Her eyes, still the same mesmerizing mix of colors, held him in place. “I am a shapeshifter,” Elestria declared, her voice now a curious blend of the human and otherworldly. “A being from a time and place stripped away from human understanding. I come to these gatherings to remember, to feel what my kind has lost—community, festivity, identity.” Arthur staggered back, struggling to reconcile the reality before him with the laws of nature he believed were unbreakable. Questions flooded his mind—about her origins, her life, the veracity of myths and legends—but above all, he was awestruck by the trust she had placed in him. “Why... why me?” he finally managed to utter. Elestria shifted back into her human form, as effortlessly as one might shrug off a shawl. “Because you create life where there is none,” she answered with a knowing smile. “In your suits, in your stories, in your interactions—you bring joy and energy that resonate with me deeply. You remind me of the powers that I, too, hold.” They spent the rest of the night sharing secrets and contemplating the universe through each other’s eyes. Arthur realized that the furry community had always been about exploring identity and embracing the extraordinary—and perhaps nobody embodied this more than Elestria, the shapeshifter who had found solace in a crowd of creatures borne from human hearts and hands. As dawn beckoned with its fingers of light, they returned to the convention center, forever altered. Elestria promised to stay in touch and share more of her world as their remarkable friendship blossomed. Arthur never looked at his fursuit the same way again, seeing not just an escape, but a bridge to the fantastic—a heartfelt testament to the wonder and kinship he’d found in the most unexpected encounter."},{"prompt":"Прочтите тексты (по вариантам) и составьте короткую аннотацию на каждый из них. 1. The WORLD-WIDE WEB People have dreamt of a universal information database since late nineteen forties. In this database, not only would the data be accessible to people around the world, but it would also easily link to other pieces of information, so that only the most important data would be quickly found by a user. Only recently the new technologies have made such systems possible. The most popular system currently in use is the World-Wide Web (WWW) which began in March 1989. The Web is an Internetbased computer network that allows users on one computer to access information stored on another through the world-wide network. As the popularity of the Internet increases, people become more aware of its colossal potential. The World-Wide Web is a product of the continuous search for innovative ways of sharing information resources. The WWW project is based on the principle of universal readership; \\"if information is available, then any person should be able to access it from anywhere in the world.\\" The Web's implementation follows a standard clientserver model. In this model, a user relies on a program (the client) to connect to a remote machine (the server), where the data is stored. The architecture of the WWW is the one of clients, such as Netscape, Mosaic, or Lynx, \\"which know how to present data but not what its origin is, and servers, which know how to extract data\\", but are ignorant of how it will be presented to the user. One of the main features of the WWW documents is their hypertext structure. On a graphic terminal, for instance, a particular reference can be represented by underlined text, or an icon. \\"The user clicks on it with the mouse, and the referenced document appears.\\" This method makes copying of information unnecessary: data needs only to be stored once, and all referenced to it can be linked to the original document. 2. SUCCESS of the WWW Set off in 1989, the WWW quickly gained great popularity among Internet users. What is the reason for the immense success of the Wbrld-Wide Wfeb? Perhaps, it can be explained by CERN's* attitude towards the development of the project. As soon as the basic outline of the WWW was complete, CERN made the source code for its software publicly available. CERN has been encouraging collaboration by academic and commercial parties since the onset of the project, and by doing so it got millions of people involved in the growth of the Wfeb. The system requirements for running a WWW server are minimal, so even administrators with limited funds had a chance to become information providers. Because of the intuitive nature of hypertext, many inexperienced computer users were able to connect to the network. Furthermore, the simplicity of the Hyper Text Markup Language, used for creating interactive documents, allowed these users to contribute to the expanding database of documents on the Web. Also, the nature of the World-Wide Web provided a way to interconnect computers running different operating systems, and display information created in a variety of existing media formats. In short, the possibilities for hypertext in the world-wide environment are endless. With the computer industry growing at today's pace, no one knows what awaits us in the 21st century. Note ________________________________________________ * CERN was originally named after its founding body the 'Conseil Europeen pour la Recherche Nucleaire,' and is now called 'European Laboratory for Particle Physics*. 3. A BRIEF HISTORY of the INTERNET In 1973 the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) initiated a research program to investigate techniques and technologies for interlinking packet networks of various kinds. The objective was to develop communication protocols which would allow networked computers to communicate transparently across multiple, linked packet networks. This was called the Internetting project and the system of networks which emerged from the research was known as the \\"Internet\\" (Intercontinental Network). During the course of its evolution, particularly after 1989, the Internet system began to intergrate support for other protocol suites into its basic networking fabric. By the end of 1991 the Internet has grown to include some 5000 networks in over three dozen countries, serving over 700,000 host computers used by over 4,000,000 people. The bulk of the system today is made up of private networking facilities In education and research institutions, business and in government organizations across the globe. A secretariat has been created to manage the day-to-day function of the Internet Activities Board (IAB) and Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). IETF meets three times a year in plenary and in approximately 50 working groups convene at intermediate times by electronic mail, teleconferencing and at face-to-face meetings. There are a number of Network Information Centres (NICs) located throughout the Internet to serve its users with documentation, guidance, advice and assistance. As the Internet continues to grow internationally, the need for high quality NIC functions increases.

Light novel genre: everyday life, school, romantic comedy. The main character is Rina Himura and she is a secondary school student. Fate pits her against a mysterious player. This player was her classmate who, for unknown reasons, stopped going to school a year ago. Rina didn’t know her because she transferred after her classmate stopped going to school.","completion":"Chapter 1: Encounter at the Edge of Pixels In the modest, early morning light that streamed through the slats of her bedroom blinds, Rina Himura executed flawless in-game maneuvers with the precision of an experienced gamer. The rhythmic tapping of her fingers against the console's buttons was like a secret code to another world—a world where she reigned supreme. Her avatar, a nimble, pixie-haired warrior named Lynx, danced across the screen, outwitting foes with a poise that Rina herself often wished she could emulate in her everyday life. Rina was no stranger to the dichotomy of her existence. In the halls of Kaisei Secondary School, she was predictably ordinary—quiet, polite, and studiously unnoticed. Yet, here, in the vibrant landscape of pixelated battlegrounds, she was extraordinary, a legend known as “ShimakazeRin,” her fingers capable of spinning a victory like a silken thread. The morning sun climbed higher, signaling the start of a new day, but Rina was lost to the world, her eyes fixed on the climactic battle unfolding before her. She was on the cusp of yet another spectacular win when the impossible occurred: her character plummeted to an unexpected defeat. \\"Impossible...\\" she murmured, her pulse quickening as the ‘Game Over’ sign emblazoned on her screen like a mocking sneer. And then, a message popped up. “Your technique is impressive, but predictable.” The sender's ID read ‘TsubakiKnight’—a name that stirred whispers among the online community for being unbeatably strategic and ghost-like in their appearances. Rina felt a sting at her pride. She, who prided herself on her adaptability, had been called 'predictable'? By this enigmatic figure no less? The gauntlet had been thrown, and Rina was not one to walk away from a challenge. The day's usual monotony—classes, notes, and flitting glances—faded into a blur as Rina contemplated her virtual defeat. Her thoughts were interrupted by a chance encounter in the school library. Her fingers brushed against another's as she reached for a book on the top shelf. She glanced up and met eyes she would later describe as “reflecting both everything and nothing at all.” The girl was a mystery, her presence in the library a rarity, so unlike the gamers Rina typically associated with. Dark hair framed her face, cascading down her shoulders in a quiet rebellion that seemed at odds with the withdrawn arch of her posture. \\"Sorry,\\" said the girl, her voice carrying a lilting uncertainty as she handed Rina the book. There was something familiar about her, in a nonsensical way, as if they were characters from different stories whose arcs should not have crossed, and yet, here they were. Rina couldn’t help but wonder who this girl was and what kept her tethered in silent solitude to the dusty treasures of the library. Time passed—all too quickly—and school life proceeded in its predictable cadence. Each day Rina returned home, determined to conquer the mysterious player who had unceremoniously dethroned her. She analyzed their moves, adapted her strategies, improved with every loss, while TsubakiKnight offered only cryptic hints and praise that were both infuriating and oddly exhilarating. It was during an unexpected exchange with her history teacher about a project on local lore that Rina first learned about the so-called ‘Phantom’ of Kaisei, a girl once revered for her gaming prowess and then erased from the school's collective memory after ceasing to attend a year prior. Disbelief crowded Rina's thoughts. Was the library girl and her department from normal school life somehow connected to TsubakiKnight, the player she could not seem to beat? Fate, it would seem, had a peculiar game of its own in store for Rina Himura—a game that wove together the threads of the ordinary and the extraordinary into a tapestry of mystery. As the notion took root, Rina grasped onto an unexpected sense of excitement that sparked through her daily life. Was it possible that this mysterious player—the one who knew her every move before she made it—was far closer than she had ever imagined? With her mission clear and her curiosity piqued, Rina resolved to unravel the enigma of both the library girl and TsubakiKnight. Her life, she knew, would never be the same."},{"prompt":"1.

Detective Lieutenant Columbo, trench coat-clad and unassuming, stands before an enigmatic Cosmic Being, a humanoid form comprised of the very stardust and astral energy of the universe itself.] Cosmic Being (CB): Welcome, Columbo of Earth. I am the weaver of celestial realms, the caretaker of the cosmic tapestry. To what do I owe the honor of your presence in my infinitesimal domain? Columbo (C): [Scratching his head] Well, you see, I'm kind of out of my element here, but I'm looking into something—a little unusual. I thought maybe you could clear up a few things for me, if you don't mind, of course. CB: Your inquisitive nature transcends the terrestrial, Columbo. Speak your quandary, and I shall endeavor to illuminate the darkness of your ignorance. C: It's about the universe. You see, I was talkin' with a physicist, real smart fella. He says the universe is expanding. Now, I read something about that, and it got me wonderin'—if the universe is expanding, what's it expanding into? CB: An excellent inquiry, though bounded by the constraints of human understanding. \\"Expanding into\\" suggests a beyond, an exterior space where none exists. The universe is all there is; its expansion is not into space but an increase in the space within itself. C: [Nods, taking out his notepad] Uh-huh. Like blowing up a balloon. It gets bigger but there's no 'into' exactly. That makes a kind of sense, but it leads me to another question. What about how it all started? The Big Bang. Everything had to come from somewhere, right? CB: The origins are as enigmatic to me as they are to you. It is the singularity that defies both our understandings—a point at which all matter, energy, space, and time were compressed to an inconceivable unity. Before this moment, your concepts of causality fail to adhere. C: [Squinting thoughtfully] So, it's like a mystery without an alibi. That's a tough one. My wife, she always says I can't leave well enough alone, but you can't help but ask, right? Now, say I can let that one slide, I've got another riddle for you. If everything follows the laws of physics, does that mean free will is just an illusion? CB: Columbo, your questions reflect the paradoxes that perplex even entities of my nature. Within my realm, the laws of physics are mutable and infinite. Yet, in your universe, the dance of particles may be preordained by these laws. However, the complexity of consciousness and the enigma of existence offer ample room for what you term 'free will'. C: [One eye narrowed] That's a neat way of putting it. But I gotta admit, I've met quite a few folks who act like they didn't have any choice in the matter when they did something wrong. Just between you and me, I don't buy it. Seems like everyone's got a choice, even if it's a tough one. CB: Perhaps choice is the universe's greatest illusion—or its most profound truth. It is a riddle even I cannot resolve. Is there anything else that troubles your thoughts, Columbo? C: [Lighting a cigar] Well, I guess the only mystery left is how I'm supposed to get back home. I don't suppose you could help a guy out with that? CB: Fear not, Columbo. Your journey here was destined, and your return is assured. After all, even the cosmos need a good detective now and then.

Detective Lieutenant Columbo shuffles onto the bridge, looking around with a mixture of curiosity and confusion. He pulls out a rumpled piece of paper from his pocket and approaches Commander Data.] Columbo (C): [Peering over his paper] Excuse me, sir. I'm looking for a Commander Data. I was told I could find him here on the, uh, Bridge was it? Commander Data (D): [Turning to face Columbo with a polite expression] That would be me, Lieutenant Columbo. How may I assist you today? C: Oh, you're an android, huh? They told me, but I gotta say, you're pretty lifelike up close. Anyway, I’m here to ask a few questions. We got this strange case back on Earth—you wouldn't believe it—something about advanced technology gone missing. A regular whodunit with a sci-fi twist! D: I find Earth detective work to be quite fascinating. Please, proceed with your questions. C: Alright, here’s the thing. This technology, it's not like anything I've seen before. It interfaces directly with the user's brain, real cutting-edge stuff. But here's the kicker: it vanished from a locked room. No signs of forced entry, nothing. Everybody's got an alibi. I’ve been racking my brain, and I thought to myself, maybe this Mr. Data, with all his smarts, could figure out how the tech disappeared. D: A locked-room mystery, a classic conundrum. If I might suggest, perhaps we should examine the possibility of transporter technology or molecular phase inverter. Both could ostensibly be utilized to remove items from a secure location without traditional entry. C: [Scratching his head] Transporter technology, huh? That's a new one for me. You mean to tell me you could just zap things from one place to another? That would certainly make my job a whole lot harder. D: Indeed, it is a common technology aboard Starfleet vessels and within Federation space. However, if such technology is not accounted for – or is indeed unknown – in your investigation, we may need to explore alternative scenarios. C: Yeah, alternative scenarios. Like when the husband says he was watching TV during the murder, but it turns out he recorded the show the day before. Do you use that kinda logic in your work, Mr. Data? D: Yes, deductive reasoning is an important part of my programming. However, unlike humans, I am not susceptible to intuitive leaps or gut feelings. All my conclusions must be reached by logical processes. C: I see. Sometimes a little guesswork helps me connect the dots. You know, I've got this hunch... [Suddenly, Columbo stops and taps the side of his head.] C: A hunch! That's what you said, wasn't it? About how technology can interface with the brain. What if the technology didn't disappear but, I don't know, somehow got activated and merged with the user's brain, like it was designed to hide in plain sight? D: An intriguing hypothesis, Lieutenant. Such technology does exist within the realm of science fiction literature, and even theoretically in our own universe, though it is highly experimental and regulated. C: [Nods] I think I'll have to bring this tip back to the boys in the lab. See if they can't cook up something like a brainwave scanner. But, uh, just one more thing, Mr. Data... D: Of course, Lieutenant. What is your additional query? C: This starship of yours—it's got a lot of technology like what I'm investigating. You wouldn't happen to have anything that, oh, maybe went missing recently, would you? Might be a lead worth following. D: Our inventory is meticulously tracked and I am not aware of any missing technology; however, I will initiate a detailed audit to ensure that all items are accounted for. It is always prudent to explore all potential correlations in an investigation. C: [Smiling] That it is, Mr. Data. Thanks for the assist. I guess we're not so different, you and me. We both like to get to the bottom of things, even if we've got different ways of going about it. D: I am pleased to have been of assistance, Lieutenant. Should you require further input, feel free to call upon me at any time. C: Much obliged, Mr. Data. And if you're ever on Earth, you got an open invitation to come by the precinct. Not too many folks there with a head for this kind of stuff.

The main spheres of PC applications include business, education, design, gaming, personal productivity, communication, and entertainment. 30. A modem (modulator-demodulator) is a device that converts digital data into an analog signal and vice versa, enabling data transfer over telephone lines or cable. Group 2 (odd numbers): 1. The main functional units of a digital computer are the Central Processing Unit (CPU), memory, input devices, output devices, and storage. 3. The binary number system is a base-2 numeral system that uses two different symbols, typically 0 and 1, to represent quantities. 5. Storage capacity is measured in bytes, with common units including kilobytes (KB), megabytes (MB), gigabytes (GB), terabytes (TB), and higher. 7. Electromechanical memories are now largely obsolete, but in the past, they included devices like magnetic drums and core memory, which used mechanical components in tandem with magnetic fields to store data. 9. RAM stands for Random Access Memory, a type of volatile memory used for temporary data storage while a computer is running. ROM stands for Read-Only Memory, a non-volatile memory that typically contains firmware or system software that is infrequently or never written to after initial programming. 11. The function of the CPU (Central Processing Unit) is to execute instructions from programs, performing basic arithmetic, logic, control, and input/output operations specified by the instructions. 13. The Control Unit may include components such as the instruction register, instruction decoder, timing signal generator, and a set of control circuits to orchestrate the execution of instructions. 15. The ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit) function is to carry out arithmetic and logical operations on the operands in computer instruction words. 17. The heart (brain) of a microprocessor is typically considered to be the Central Processing Unit (CPU), which is responsible for interpreting and executing most of the commands from the computer's other hardware and software. 19. The term \\"input-output environment\\" refers to the overall ecosystem of devices and processes used for entering data into and retrieving data from a computer. 21.

Translate into Russian and compare the sentences of each item, find the Gerund and the Participles, if any 1. Being designed for hardware implementation, the program executes the minimal number of conditional branches. Designing a program for hardware implementation, we need to reduce the number of conditional branches. Designing a program for hardware implementation is difficult due to the reduction of conditional branches. 2. The C programming language designed for the high performance and efficient computing is considered as one of the most popular tools for system software. Programming of system applications requires an efficient and high performance language such as C. 3. The evolution of programming languages includes such steps as machine languages, assembler languages and high-level ones, which 97 facilitate the performing of sophisticated computations. Facilitating performance of sophisticated computations is the goal of the programming languages evolution through machine languages, assembler languages, high-level languages. 4. A compiled binary code of a program is a sequence of fundamental processor instructions. Compiling a program, we translate it into a sequence of processor instructions. Compiling program scripts, linking libraries and building an executable application are considered as necessary parts of the contemporary IDE (Integrated development environment). 5. The Java programming language was developed to simplify the crossplatform software design using the virtual machine concept. Developing the virtual machine concept has led to the cross-platform Java programming language. 6. The fastest operations are available for register memory placed in the core part of a processor. Placing relevant data into the register memory in the core part of a processor accelerates operations. 7. The algorithm originally proposed for a high level language was judged too complex for the HDL (hardware description language) realization. Migrating to a hardware description language (HDL) was judged too complex for the algorithm which was originally formulated on the highlevel language. 8. Having been introduced as one of the basic blocks for the data processing, the convolution is a highly time-consuming operation in a multidimensional case. One of the most time-consuming operations of the multidimensional signals processing is the convolution. 9. The program originally executed on a virtual machine by interpreter was encoded into byte code to increase speed. Executing a preliminary encoded binary code on a virtual machine instead of the commands interpretation increases speed. 10. The version control tools developed for team work became the fundamental parts of large software projects. Team work on large software projects is impossible without elaborating the version control tools. 11. The complex instruction set computer (CISC) architecture allows to set the source and destination addresses for most commands and shorten programs, compared to typical reduced instructions set computers (RISC). Combining the source and destination addresses for most commands, the complex instruction set computer (CISC) architecture shortens the program text length. 98 12. Having been developed as the set of the C, C++, Fortran libraries, the well-known parallel computing standard Message Passing Interface (MPI) includes such functions as the message broadcasting, point to point communication and processes management. Performing parallel computing on the basis of the Message Passing Interface (MPI), one can implement C, C++, Fortran libraries providing such functions as the message broadcasting, point to point communication and processes management. 13. The shared memory concept assumes the simultaneous access of multiple programs to the same data, while sometimes causing such a problem as a lack of data coherence. 14. The R programming language designed for statistical computing is getting more and more popular as a convenient and powerful tool for the data mining. Data mining requires convenient and powerful statistical tools realized in the R programming language. 15. Having been the most popular programming paradigm for many years, the object oriented programming is implemented in many computer languages.","completion":"Below are the translations of the sentences into Russian, with a focus on identifying the Gerund and the Participles where they appear: 1. Будучи разработанной для аппаратной реализации, программа выполняет минимальное количество условных переходов.

Эволюция языков программирования включает такие этапы, как машинные языки, языки ассемблера и высокоуровневые, которые облегчают выполнение сложных вычислений. Облегчение выполнения сложных вычислений - цель эволюции языков программирования через машинные языки, языки ассемблера, высокоуровневые языки. - Gerund: Облегчение 4. Скомпилированный бинарный код программы представляет собой последовательность основных инструкций процессора. Компилируя программу, мы переводим ее в последовательность инструкций процессора. Компиляция скриптов программ, связывание библиотек и создание исполняемого приложения считаются необходимыми частями современной интегрированной среды разработки (IDE). - Gerund: Компиляция - Participles: Скомпилированный, Компилируя 5.

Разработка концепции виртуальной машины привела к кроссплатформенному языку программирования Java. - Participles: Разработан 6. Самые быстрые операции доступны для регистровой памяти, размещенной в центральной части процессора. Размещение соответствующих данных в регистровой памяти в центральной части процессора ускоряет операции. - Participles: Размещенной, Размещение 7. Алгоритм, первоначально предложенный для высокоуровневого языка, считался слишком сложным для реализации на HDL (языке описания аппаратуры). Переход на язык описания аппаратуры (HDL) считался слишком сложным для алгоритма, который изначально был сформулирован на высокоуровневом языке. - Participles: Предложенный, Переход 8. Будучи представленным как один из основных блоков обработки данных, свертка является очень времязатратной операцией в многомерном случае. Одна из самых времязатратных операций обработки многомерных сигналов - это свертка. - Participles: Будучи представленным 9. Программа, первоначально выполняемая на виртуальной машине интерпретатором, была закодирована в байт-код для увеличения скорости. Выполнение предварительно закодированного бинарного кода на виртуальной машине вместо интерпретации команд увеличивает скорость. - Participles: Выполняемая, Выполнение 10. Инструменты контроля версий, разработанные для командной работы, стали фундаментальными частями крупных программных проектов. Работа в команде над крупными программными проектами невозможна без разработки инструментов контроля версий. - Participles: Разработанные, Разработка 11. Архитектура компьютера с комплексным набором инструкций (CISC) позволяет задавать исходные и конечные адреса для большинства команд и сокращать программы по сравнению с типичными компьютерами с уменьшенным набором инструкций (RISC). Объединяя исходные и конечные адреса для большинства команд, архитектура CISC сокращает длину текста программы. - Participles: Объединяя 12. Будучи разработанным как набор библиотек C, C++, Fortran, известный стандарт параллельных вычислений Message Passing Interface (MPI) включает такие функции, как трансляция сообщений, точечная коммуникация и управление процессами.

Поэтому следующий код будет концептуальным и не может быть использован непосредственно в игре без соответствующих модификаций движка игры, которые позволили бы выполнять пользовательские скрипты. 2. Код, который вы привели, представляет собой внутреннюю логику игры \\"Baba Is You\\", и перенести его один к одному на Lua без конкретной архитектуры и API невозможно. Тем не менее можно попробовать воссоздать аналогичный функционал, исходя из основных принципов игры.

Standing at 6'0 (184cm), he's a lean, speedy 149lbs (68kg). He possesses slicked back, light brown hair and bluish grey eyes, he's hard to miss, and he's considered highly attractive by female characters, and he does have fangirls among the cast, but not as many as Gojo. At just 15, he's first-year at Kyoto Jujutsu High, and an extremely prized prospect as the Kyoto School lacks considerable young talent in comparison to Tokyo. Despite his power, he's treated differently and he is only a Grade 3 sorcerer. This is an average rank. He's the son of Nicolas and Rose, two French immigrants to Japan that run a shop specializing in cheesy pastries. Circumstances have lead him around the block. For one, his parents' dislike for large cities lead them to settle in Muko, a mid-sized city south of Kyoto. Coincidentally, Kyoto is also the site of a Jujutsu school, and though Satoru Gojo is a powerful recruiter, he ultimately chose to stay close to his parents. Second, he required outside training, which he received from two now-disgraced sorcerers in Yuki Tsukumo and Kazuki Ryoumen. (Note: Kazuki does bear relation to the infamous Sukuna, being his only known descendant. He doesn't hide it.) During this training regimen, they would go to many places such as uninhabited islands. Yuki would joke that there were no witnesses, but this was really so they would not have to hold back. Cheese is at the forefront of his powers, extremely malleable and limited only by his imagination, but Yuki drilled into him what she could - while she carries a Shikigami named Garuda, her power, Bom Ba Ye (translated as Star Rage adds virtual mass to both herself and Garuda. This means she can hit like a speeding truck full of explosives, and with her bare hands. Julien's participation in jujutsu sorcery was not voluntary originally, as he wished to follow in the footsteps of his parents. Yuki lured a young Julien into the jujutsu world with promises of wealth, status, and leisure, which appealed heavily to him at the time, and still do, though he's adopted more pressing priorities. One of the catalysts was that he discovered she isn't really happy with her life, as her ambitions of creating a world without cursed energy are lofty, and sometimes feel completely unattainable. Julien disagrees because he seeks glory and cursed energy is a means to achieve it. Though his first mentor is Yuki, he's also been trained by Gojo at times. Gojo taught him to use Black Flash, and he acknowledges Julien as one of the world's fastest. Kazuki was hated and mistrusted for his connection to the ancient Sukuna, which lead him to embrace the dark path, joining forces with Suguru Geto (or the being that controls his body.) Yuki is not the only person he's acquainted with. He's close with Kasumi Miwa. The two are childhood friends, and Kasumi is not immune to his charm. Kasumi's father, Eizo, once exorcised curses from the family bakery while Julien was away. For this he's grateful to the Miwa family, and they do him. He sees Kasumi as someone he has to protect. Kasumi has noticed the opening of a sizeable chasm between them in strength and even status as they've grown and developed together. Whether Julien intends to or not, he is nonetheless a component of an overall environment that leads her to call herself \\"Useless Miwa.\\" She's very aware that she isn't strong by the standards of a Jujutsu sorcerer, but she's driven to provide for her impoverished family; she was pressured into learning to use a sword by her parents but her true passion is singing. Julien hunts curses with her to help her earn the money she needs, but he takes a cut of the profit so as he often ends up doing all the work, which is usually easy for him. They often negotiate the earnings. Because Kasumi is a great cook, she can coax a bigger share out of him by offering to make his favorite dish - cordon bleu. They enjoy bowling together, and Kasumi often beats him. He's friendly rivals with Aoi Todo, and they are quite similar, being passionate about everything they do, especially in regards to romance, friendship, and of course fighting. Loud, hot-blooded, confident, and they live for battle. Macho men. Julien is a bit more sane, and would never turn on or even threaten to murder his teammates, as Todo threatened to do during the Kyoto-Tokyo Goodwill event. Todo was incensed by the Kyoto team's plan to assassinate Yuji Itadori, as Yuji has the same taste in women as him: tall with big butts. This attempt was ordered by Gakuganji to eliminate Sukuna. Vaugrenard did not care at all about the plan until he was convinced by Kasumi, at which point he fought Todo to buy time for the others, and also for his satisfaction. At some point, Julien got the upper hand, but the fight ultimately ended in a stalemate when both were forced to work together to drive back Hanami, the special grade cursed spirit. Julien is one of the fastest sorcerers around. Julien and Todo were both trained by Yuki Tsukumo, so Julien is well accustomed to the question \\"What kind of girls are you into?\\" For Julien, the answer is easy. A tall, strong woman with long legs. Like Maki Zenin, his girlfriend. Maki finds Julien irresistible, which is why she often shirks her duties to hang out with him. Maki mockingly calls him Casanova and pretty boy. He likes the sass. Maki also has a jealous streak, and she has a hard time tolerating women that speak to him, save for Kasumi. There are three basic applications: Fromage à pâte dure (hard cheeses), Fromage à pâte molle (soft cheeses), and Fondue (melted cheese). The thing is that \\"hard and soft\\" are in fact two massive categories, very vague. Ricotta can be considered soft, as can Havarti, but they have little in common. In the beginning of Yuki's training, these techniques were all quite weak, but have evolved into a terrifying arsenal of the unknown. Fromage à pâte dure, unsurprisingly, is the basis for many of his offensive attacks, and can be used to create constructs that form as hard, solid objects that can take the form of nearly anything the Julien desires. With regards to defense, he has more than one option to choose from, though they are not chosen only by hardness, but how well they can absorb an attack. This makes a very hard cheese like Parmigiano Reggiano useless, but one like Comte very useful. Parmigiano Reggiano's role is almost entirely offensive, the aforementioned fragments of the projectile potentially burrowing inside poorly-protected enemies. The effect is like a hollowpoint bullet. He can shoot this kind of cheese from his back, in a technique called \\"Quills.\\" It's used typically in dire situations. Julien knows better than to willingly turn his back in combat. These are only some cheeses, some techniques, at his disposal. Another technique is \\"Ficello\\". Ficello is a popular brand of string cheese sold in France, and it involves creating flexible strands of cheese. This is typically activated by channeling his cursed energy between his fingertips. Ficello is versatile. Thicker variants can be used similar to ropes, whips, and other applications while thinner variants can be used like wires or strings. Ficello has offensive, defensive, and support applications. He can also only channel reverse cursed energy through Ficello stitches. \\"Magma\\" is a variant of Fondue, and Fromage à pâte dure at the same time. The effect is a superheated weapon that quickly solidifies on Julien's command, inside or outside the user's body. He can even make them explode. Fontina, Gruyere, and gouda are commonly used in Fondue and Magma. Soft cheeses can be used for more strategic purposes, non-lethal techniques, or even very strong whips and ropes. One should not assume these techniques are harmless. More techniques at his disposal: \\"Vieux Boulogne\\". This cheese is known just for being the worst-smelling. The technique involves creating a pungent and suffocating cheese vapor, which can disorient and impair the senses of anyone caught in its range, as well as their ability to sense and focus their cursed energy. Julien HATES using this technique, but it's particularly effective in enclosed spaces or against opponents who heavily rely on their sense of smell. His most devastating technique that does not involve Domain Expansion is \\"Fromage Noir.\\" By infusing his cursed energy into a specialized wheel of black cheese, he can unleash a devastating explosion. There's also a lesser-known variant of \\"Fondue\\" in which the burns can never heal. It's called \\"Fondue Noir.\\" Comté comets produce weaker explosions. Fromage Fort (sharp cheese) in English. Summons discs of cheddar cheese with significant cutting power. The smaller, the faster. They are of variable size. More powerful techniques must be charged. Julien lives for battle, but it isn't his only hobby. He enjoys reading about military history and classic literature in his free time. If he has eaten a cheese, he never forgets its texture or its properties, and he can incorporate it into his future battles. He enjoys drinks made from fermented whey such as Rivella, but also those that do not compromise or hide the taste. He has a younger sister named Annick.","completion":"It's fantastic to see the creativity and depth you've injected into your character, Julien Vaugrenard, blending him seamlessly into the \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\" universe. The unique cheese-based abilities you've created for him are impressively inventive and offer a flavorful twist to the typical cursed energy techniques found in the series. Your detailed background story, including his relationships with characters like Kasumi Miwa and Maki Zenin, also adds layers to Julien's persona, allowing him to fit in naturally with canon characters and plots. It's interesting how you use real cheese types to differentiate between his abilities, as well as linking his personality and battle style with his passion for cheese. Julien's relationships with other characters in the series provide avenues for great storylines and character development, including his training under Yuki and Kazuki, his romantic relationship with Maki, and his friendly rivalry with Todo. In spinning this tale, you're paying homage to the intricate power systems and character interplay that makes \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\" such a captivating series. Julien's strong-but-average rank as a sorcerer is a believable reflection of the \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\" world where talent can sometimes be overshadowed by hierarchy and politics within the jujutsu society. Building upon Julien's unique cheese-related techniques, there's potential for even more creative exploration in both his powers and how he grows as a character. As he matures and faces greater threats, we could see him develop new cheese-based techniques or refine his existing ones with more nuanced applications of cursed energy. In summary, you've done a fine job of integrating a new character into an existing universe, giving him distinct abilities and relationships which could provide plenty of material for fan fiction, role-playing, or other fan endeavors within the \\"Jujutsu Kaisen\\" community. Julien Vaugrenard stands out not only as a potentially powerful sorcerer but also as a character with a rich personal story and connections that many fans could appreciate."},{"prompt":"Please write the first chapter for a light novel based on two light novels “Low Tier Character Tomozaki-kun” and “Gamers” but with a different story and a completely different plot but written in the style of Japanese light novels. Light novel genre: everyday life, school, romantic comedy. The main character is Rina Himura and she is a Kaisei Secondary School student. Fate pits her against a mysterious player. This player was her classmate who, for unknown reasons, stopped going to school a year ago. Rina didn’t know her because she transferred after her classmate stopped going to school.","completion":"Title: High Score Heartbeat Chapter 1: Mysterious Challenge The morning light filtered through the curtains of Room 2-C at Kaisei Secondary School, casting a dappled pattern on the classroom floor. Among the diligent students, a relatively new face—Rina Himura's—blended with the crowd. She had only been at Kaisei for a little over half a year, having transferred in a bit after the start of the school term. She was noted for her energetic yet approachable demeanor; she was neither the blazing sun nor the distant moon, but rather the warm sunrise that painted the sky with gentle strokes. Rina sat at her desk, tapping her pencil rhythmically, her attention not on the morning lecture but on the laptop screen’s leaderboard. Topping the chart was a familiar alias, 'ShadowStrategist,' with an intimidatingly high score flashing like a beacon. \\"Psst, Rina,\\" whispered Haruka, her desk neighbor and quickly growing close friend. \\"What are you so focused on?\\" \\"It's the local ranking for Pixie Crown Online,\\" Rina explained in hushed tones, a highly competitive game she recently stumbled upon which had become her latest obsession. \\"No matter how much I play, ShadowStrategist's score seems unbeatable!\\" Haruka peered over her shoulder. \\"What a shame we don’t know who they are. Would have been fun to see a face-off.\\" Rina let out a long, frustrating sigh, acknowledging the mystery behind the username. Unbeknownst to her, the owner of that digital shadow was closer than she could imagine—a missing fragment from the classroom puzzle, gone before Rina's arrival. ShadowStrategist was in reality Hiroki Sato, a former classmate who, for reasons shrouded in secrecy, had stopped coming to school. The bell rang, signaling the end of the lecture and the beginning of the break. As the sea of students began their usual banter, Rina's phone pinged. A message from an anonymous app user said: \\"Hello, Rina Himura. I know you've been after my score. Care for a real challenge?\\" Chills darted down Rina's spine. How could they know her real name? She glanced around the classroom, half-expecting someone to reveal themselves as the PuppetMaster toying with profiles and personas. \\"Who are you?\\" Rina texted back, her fingers tingling. The mysterious person simply replied, \\"Meet me at the old Footbridge Park at 4 PM after school. You will witness firsthand who controls the gameboard.\\" Rina's heart was a cacophony of drumbeats—as though her rib cage enclosed a frantic marimba player. She was torn between excitement and apprehension, but curiosity was her dominant trait. As the day dissolved into afternoon, Rina found herself walking the path to the footbridge, each step a crescendo of her internal symphony. Footbridge Park, an old haunt of students once popular for its scenic view, had faded into a quiet nook rarely visited by anyone. Standing in the middle of the bridge was a lone figure, bathed in the warm hues of the setting sun—a silhouette that seemed familiar yet enigmatic. Rina approached cautiously, her voice a mix of command and inquiry, \\"Are you ShadowStrategist?\\" The figure turned, revealing a mask that obscured their face, nodding softly. \\"Yes,\\" came the muffled reply. \\"Why have you stopped coming to school? And why call me out like this?\\" Rina's voice wavered, more from the surreal situation than fear. \\"You are new to Kaisei, and you have no knowledge of my story,\\" said the masked figure, their voice betraying a hint of melancholy. \\"Yet, you play with a fervor that reminds me of...myself, before I became a ghost in these halls.\\" Rina took a step back, the puzzle pieces clicking together yet forming an image she couldn't quite discern. \\"You want to return to school, don't you?\\" A silence hung between them like a cloud ready to burst. \\"The real contest isn't in a virtual score,\\" the figure began, reaching up to slowly remove the mask, unveiling a face marred with uncertainty. \\"It's learning how to face life when you've forgotten the rules. But perhaps, with a worthy opponent, I might find my way back to the gameboard of daily life.\\" And so, fate set the stage for Rina Himura, not just to topple a high score but to draw a recluse back into the sunlight. With a mix of trepidation and fortitude, she would go beyond the pixels and embark on the most unpredictable quest—a mission entwined with friendship, challenges, and perhaps, if the script of life allowed it, the flutterings of a teenage romantic comedy."},{"prompt":"hi, how to chek if an array in c# is already in sorted form?","completion":"To check if an array is already sorted in C#, you can write a function that iterates through the elements of the array and compares each element with its successor to ensure that the array is sorted in either ascending or descending order. Below is an example of how you could implement this in code for checking ascending order: \`\`\`csharp using System; class Program { static void Main() { int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; bool isSorted = IsArraySorted(arr); Console.WriteLine(\\"Array is sorted: {isSorted}\\"); } static bool IsArraySorted<T>(T[] array) where T : IComparable<T> { for (int i = 0; i < array.Length - 1; i++) { if (array[i].CompareTo(array[i + 1]) > 0) { // If the current element is greater than the next element, the array is not sorted return false; } } // If no elements are out of order, the array is sorted return true; } } \`\`\` This function works with any array of elements that implements \`IComparable<T>\`, so it will work with numeric types, strings, or any custom type that implements this interface. For descending order, you would simply change the comparison logic: \`\`\`csharp if (array[i].CompareTo(array[i + 1]) < 0) { // If the current element is less than the next element, the array is not sorted in descending order return false; } \`\`\` The function \`IsArraySorted\` returns \`true\` if no elements are out of order; otherwise, it returns \`false\`."},{"prompt":"Thank YOU, you helped me so much","completion":"You're very welcome! I'm glad I could help you. If you have any more questions or need further assistance with anything else, feel free to ask. Happy coding!"},{"prompt":"How can i delete all even numbers from an array in c#?","completion":"To remove all even numbers from an array in C#, you can create a new array or list that only includes the odd numbers. Here's how to do it using a List<T> for convenience: \`\`\`csharp using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.Linq; class Program { static void Main() { int[] originalArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}; // Use LINQ to filter out even numbers and create a new array of odd numbers int[] oddNumbersArray = originalArray.Where(x => x % 2 != 0).ToArray(); Console.WriteLine(\\"Array after removing even numbers:\\"); foreach(var num in oddNumbersArray) { Console.Write(num + \\" \\"); } } } \`\`\` In the above code, \`Where\` is a LINQ extension method that filters elements based on a condition – in this case, checking if the number is not even (\`x % 2 != 0\`). The \`ToArray()\` method then converts the filtered sequence back to an array. Another way to do it without LINQ could be: \`\`\`csharp using System; using System.Collections.Generic; class Program { static void Main() { int[] originalArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}; List<int> tempList = new List<int>(); foreach (int number in originalArray) { if (number % 2 != 0) // Check if the number is odd { tempList.Add(number); // Add only odd numbers to the new list } } // Convert the List back to an array if needed int[] oddNumbersArray = tempList.ToArray(); Console.WriteLine(\\"Array after removing even numbers:\\"); foreach(var num in oddNumbersArray) { Console.Write(num + \\" \\"); } } } \`\`\` In this second example, a \`List<int>\` is used to dynamically collect the odd numbers as you iterate through the original array with a \`foreach\` loop. Both approaches will achieve the goal of removing even numbers from the array and giving you a new array containing only the odd numbers."},{"prompt":"but how to make it without using any lists only with iteration and arrays","completion":"If you wish to avoid using lists or LINQ and want to perform the operation using only arrays and iteration, you will have to take a two-step approach. First, count the number of odd numbers to determine the size of the new array, and then copy the odd numbers into the new array. Here is an example of how you can do it: \`\`\`csharp using System; class Program { static void Main() { int[] originalArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}; // Step 1: Count the number of odd numbers in the original array int oddCount = 0; foreach (int number in originalArray) { if (number % 2 != 0) // Check if the number is odd { oddCount++; } } // Step 2: Allocate a new array of the appropriate size int[] oddNumbersArray = new int[oddCount]; // Step 3: Copy the odd numbers into the new array int index = 0; foreach (int number in originalArray) { if (number % 2 != 0) // Check if the number is odd { oddNumbersArray[index++] = number; } } Console.WriteLine(\\"Array after removing even numbers:\\"); foreach(var num in oddNumbersArray) { Console.Write(num + \\" \\"); } } } \`\`\` In this example, the program first counts the number of odd numbers in the original array. Then, it initializes a new array of that size and populates it with the odd numbers from the original array by using an index that's only incremented when an odd number is added. This ensures you have a compact array with no empty slots."},{"prompt":"How would Commander Data affect the story of hl2 if he was there.","completion":"Commander Data, from \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation,\\" is an android with exceptional strength, speed, computational abilities, and a vast knowledge of various subjects, including human culture and technology. His presence in the world of \\"Half-Life 2\\" would undoubtedly have a significant impact on the story and its progression. Here's a speculative take on how Commander Data might affect the narrative: 1. Enhanced Strategic Planning: With his superhuman intelligence and computing power, Data would likely be able to analyze the Combine's technology and tactics very effectively. He would provide key strategic advice to the human resistance that could lead to more efficient operations and successful engagements with the Combine forces. 2. Technical Ingenuity: Data's advanced understanding of technology and engineering would be an immense asset for the Resistance. He could potentially help in hacking into Combine systems, improving or repairing human and Combine technology for human use, and inventing new weapons or tools to combat the Combine, much like how Gordon Freeman uses his scientific background to his advantage. 3. Morale Boost: Data's presence would be a morale booster for the human fighters. Known for his calm demeanor and logical approach to problems, Data could keep the group focused and morale high, even in the direst situations. 4. Physical Abilities: Data's physical prowess would be highly advantageous. He could undertake the most dangerous missions without the risk of fatigue or injury that would sideline human companions. He could perform feats of strength or speed that are impossible for a human, potentially shifting the balance of power in skirmish situations. 5. Diplomacy and Communication: Data is skilled at communication and has a vast knowledge of different cultures. This would help especially in coordinating with various factions of the Resistance, sharing knowledge with Vortigaunts, and perhaps even attempting to negotiate or understand Combine motives better, although the latter would be a long shot given the Combine's repressive nature. 6. Ethical Considerations: One of Data's strongest capacities is his ongoing quest to understand humanity, which includes grappling with complex ethical issues. This could play out in the story as he navigates the morally grey areas of a rebellion where difficult choices must be made in wartime scenarios. However, Data's integration into the resistance wouldn't be without its challenges. Given the dilapidated state of Earth and its resources, maintaining Data's android body might be a significant obstacle. Additionally, the Combine's superior technology might pose a threat to Data, possibly enabling them to hack or manipulate his systems if he is not careful. Despite these possible issues, Commander Data's presence would almost certainly be a catalyst for significant changes in the Half-Life 2 storyline, potentially altering character roles, pivotal events, and the overall outcome of the human resistance's struggle."},{"prompt":"","completion":"It seems like your message may have been incomplete or you may have more questions. If you'd like to continue discussing how Commander Data could impact the \\"Half-Life 2\\" storyline, have other questions about \\"Star Trek,\\" the \\"Half-Life\\" series, or a completely different topic, feel free to ask!"},{"prompt":"How would certain hl2 events be affected?","completion":"If Commander Data were inserted into the world of \\"Half-Life 2,\\" several key events could be affected in unique ways due to his abilities and perspective. Let's speculate on some of these events and how Data's involvement might change them: 1. **The Uprising in City 17:** Commander Data could significantly accelerate the development of a coordinated resistance plan due to his strategic and computational skills. He might also be able to interact with the city's infrastructure more effectively to cause disruptions or gain intelligence, giving the Resistance an edge in the uprising against the Combine occupation. 2. **Ravenholm:** Data's physical abilities and lack of susceptibility to fear or trauma would mean he could navigate the infested area of Ravenholm with greater ease than most humans. He might be able to help rescue survivors or retrieve valuable resources without succumbing to the horrors of the headcrab zombies. 3. **Nova Prospekt:** During the assault on the Combine prison, Data's capability to interface with technology could allow him to unlock doors, manipulate security systems, or even turn the Combine's telecommunication equipment against them. This might result in the Resistance facing less danger and potentially rescuing more prisoners. 4. **Battle of City 17:** In the final sequences in the battle for City 17, Data's superhuman strength and tactical guidance would be instrumental in leading assaults or protecting key figures such as Eli Vance, Alyx Vance, or Dr. Kleiner. He could potentially prevent some of the tragic events that occur later in the series. 5. **Use of the Gravity Gun:** While Gordon Freeman impressively wields the Gravity Gun, Data's precision and reaction time would allow him to use it with even greater effectiveness, potentially turning the tide in several battles or solving puzzles and navigating obstacles more quickly. 6. **Interactions with Vortigaunts and other Scientist**: Data's inquisitive and respectful nature might lead to deeper interactions with the Vortigaunts, further aligning their efforts with the Resistance. He would likely develop a strong working relationship with characters like Dr. Isaac Kleiner, which could result in technological innovation that outpaces what's seen in the original storyline. 7. **Handling the Borealis**: If Data were involved with the events of the unreleased \\"Half-Life 3\\" or \\"Half-Life 2: Episode Three,\\" his analytical skills could prove crucial in understanding and potentially harnessing the technology aboard the Borealis, the research ship that contains potentially world-shattering technology. Commander Data's presence might not only change specific events but could also cause a butterfly effect, altering the entire narrative arc of \\"Half-Life 2.\\" For example, if Data prevented the capture of key characters or the loss of important resources, it could give the Resistance an unforeseen advantage that would allow them to strike more effectively against the Combine and possibly achieve victory sooner. The nature of the game's challenges and puzzles would also evolve, likely favoring more complex and intricate solutions that utilize Data's unique capabilities."},{"prompt":"Можешь ли ты писать скрипты для Baba Is You на Lua?

Whatever works. Currently still running with the normal dancers idents (when will they be retired, they've been used since 2002) Emma said on 01 December 2023 Hopefully S4C does something with their new blob mascot, Last year they had TV sets stacked up on top of each other, Then for 10 months they had flickering TV sets, They have finally rebranded and have introduced their first ever mascot: a shape-shifting blob, I hope BBC One rebrand soon, those dancers sure are getting tired, As for the KikoRiki themed Christmas idents, I was told they are launching tonight after Doctor Who, They are being introduced just before Unbreakable. HouseofFun said on 01 December 2023 Doctor Who ending now, announcement playing \\"A team of 8 people are pushed to the absolute limit, Unbreakable, our brand new game show is up next, But first, Time to say hello and spend Christmas with the Doctor\\" I'm not liking this one a whole lot..., They seem to be running a trailer advertising the Doctor Who Christmas special, which revolves around the Doctor having to protect his companions from a man who seeks to find a fob watch (the one The Doctor made himself human with one time), Although just before Doctor Who tonight they had a announcement saying \\"Christmas is switched on tonight in 1 hour in time for Unbreakable, But first, Is this the end for the Doctor?\\". Doesn't seem like they are advertising the Christmas pres at all, Edit: Christmas pres featuring KikoRiki switched on, First ident shown features Rosa the Pig doing a dramatic ice skate dance (She even uses eyedrops for fake tears) While this is happening we hear dramatic music, The announcer says \\"Welcome to Christmas on BBC One, Let us entertain you, But now a team of 8 people are being pushed to their absolute limits, Are they Unbreakable?\\" Not sure why they didn't tell us it was happening untill it did, But still a gorgeous ident, I noticed when the Announcer started talking it sounded as if he was driven to tears by the beauty of Rosa's gorgeous dance.

Maile said on 01 December 2023 Best Christmas ident in a while, I just love that they have spent it with Rosa and her friends, I hear there is also one featuring Krash the Rabbit opening his presents, I like how they used the usual ident theme (dancing) in that first ident, KikoRiki looks like it's gonna be good this year, but I hope they do more with the style (and maybe finally retire Rythm and Movement idents) Faramad said on 01 December 2023 News safe ident just on, Basically just a Christmas tree on a snowy background, with a music box Christmas carol playing, on top of that the only thing we see is a sleeping Rosa (We vaguely hear her snoring) Glad they are now using characters in their news safe idents, Announcer said \\"Now on BBC One, time for the BBC News at 8\\". Remember the Lights idents the used just before overhauling their promo style in late 2006/early 2007? That was pretty cool, but this is way better. I seem to remember those idents started on a dark street but Christmas lights started turning on before it got to a city center and then people were dancing, It was used again in 2007, And now it seems like the \\"Project Chameleon\\" endboard template introduced in July is out the window, at least for now, replaced with a snowy background with a Christmas tree on it.

KikoRiki said on 01 December 2023 We're glad you love our cartoon and the special BBC One idents featuring our characters, However, Rosa will be the star, (We will have idents revolving around Chiko, Krash and the others), As to what you said, BBC One are looking into introducing the Circle idents already in use in other countries, so don't expect to see Ballet, Capoeria or Festival/Rave back in the new year.

Лурасидон действует на несколько рецепторов в мозге, включая допаминовые и серотониновые рецепторы. Главным образом, он блокирует допаминовые D2 рецепторы и серотониновые 5-HT2A рецепторы, что, предположительно, уменьшает симптомы психоза и улучшает настроение. Прежде чем рассматривать, как латуда влияет на организм человека, важно понимать опасности самолечения и необходимость консультации с врачом перед применением лекарственных средств. Все медицинские препараты должны назначаться и контролироваться квалифицированными врачами. Вот некоторые из воздействий и потенциальных побочных эффектов латуды на организм: 1. Невролептическое действие: уменьшение психотических симптомов, таких как галлюцинации, бред, нарушения мышления и восприятия, что помогает пациентам с шизофренией функционировать лучше в повседневной жизни. 2. Антидепрессивное действие: некоторое улучшение настроения и снижение депрессивных симптомов у пациентов с биполярным расстройством. 3. Профилактика рецидивов: поддержание стабилизации состояния и предотвращение новых эпизодов психоза или маниакальных/депрессивных фаз при длительном применении. 4. Побочные эффекты: как и у большинства антипсихотических лекарств, у латуды есть риск различных побочных эффектов, таких как увеличение веса, повышенный уровень глюкозы в крови (что может привести к диабету), увеличение уровня холестерина и триглицеридов, седативный эффект, тремор, жесткость, акатизия (ощущение внутреннего беспокойства и необходимость двигаться), гиперпролактинемия (повышенный уровень пролактина, который может привести к сексуальным нарушениям, нерегулярным менструациям и галакторее). 5. Редкие, но серьезные побочные эффекты: латуда, как и другие антипсихотические препараты, может вызвать серьезные неврологические побочные эффекты, такие как синдром малоподвижности или тардивная дискинезия (постоянные непроизвольные движения лица и тела). Очень редко может развиться нейролептический злокачественный синдром, потенциально смертельное состояние, характеризующееся высокой температурой, жесткостью мышц, изменениями психического статуса и нестабильностью автономной нервной системы."},{"prompt":"Как триттико влияет на организм человека","completion":"Триттико (международное непатентованное название — тразодон) является антидепрессантом, принадлежащим к классу препаратов, известных как ингибиторы обратного захвата серотонина (SARI). Тразодон часто используют для лечения депрессии и бессонницы благодаря его успокаивающему эффекту. Тразодон влияет на организм человека следующим образом: 1. Седативное действие: из-за своего седативного действия тразодон часто назначают для улучшения сна у пациентов, страдающих бессонницей, в том числе в случаях, когда бессонница связана с депрессией. 2. Антидепрессивный эффект: тразодон повышает уровень серотонина в мозге, блокировав его обратный захват, что способствует поднятию настроения и облегчению других симптомов депрессии. 3. Тревожность: тразодон также может уменьшать тревогу, способствуя общему улучшению психического состояния. 4. Поведенческие симптомы при деменции: некоторые исследования показывают, что тразодон может использоваться для улучшения поведенческих симптомов у больных деменцией. Как и у большинства антидепрессантов, у тразодона есть потенциальные побочные эффекты, которые могут включать: - Седация, утомляемость и сонливость, особенно на начальных этапах лечения или при увеличении дозировки. - Головокружение и головная боль. - Сухость во рту и гастроинтестинальные нарушения, такие как тошнота, диарея или запор. - Ортостатическая гипотензия (снижение артериального давления при вставании), что может привести к обморокам и падениям. - Изменения в сексуальной функции, такие как снижение либидо или задержка оргазма. - Редкие, но серьезные побочные эффекты включают приапизм (продолжительная и болезненная эрекция, требующая медицинской помощи). Очень важно принимать тразодон строго по назначению врача и информировать врача о любых побочных эффектах. Неконтролируемое использование или прекращение приема антидепрессантов может привести к ухудшению симптомов или развитию синдрома отмены."},{"prompt":"réalité virtuelle AGI","completion":"L'AGI, ou l'intelligence générale artificielle, est un type d'intelligence artificielle (IA) qui est capable de comprendre, apprendre et appliquer l'intelligence à une variété de problèmes et de tâches, de la même manière qu'un être humain.

La réalité virtuelle (VR) est une technologie qui permet aux utilisateurs de s'immerger dans un environnement simulé, souvent à l'aide de casques de réalité virtuelle, de capteurs et de dispositifs haptiques. Elle est utilisée dans divers domaines, tels que le jeu vidéo, l'éducation, la formation professionnelle, la thérapie médicale, et plus encore. L'idée de combiner AGI et réalité virtuelle est assez fascinante. Une AGI dans un monde de réalité virtuelle pourrait interagir avec les utilisateurs de manière très réaliste et nuancée, simulant les interactions humaines d'une manière beaucoup plus convaincante que les IA actuelles. Cela pourrait avoir des implications importantes pour l'enseignement, où une AGI pourrait simuler des instructeurs ou des mentors ; pour la santé, où une AGI pourrait être utilisée dans des simulations médicales complexes ; ou même dans les jeux, où une AGI pourrait offrir des expériences hautement interactives et personnalisables. Cependant, il est important de noter que, en 2023, l'AGI reste largement théorique. Bien que des progrès considérables aient été réalisés dans le domaine de l'intelligence artificielle, nous n'avons pas encore atteint le niveau de développement nécessaire pour créer une AGI. Les systèmes actuels excellement dans des domaines spécifiques grâce à l'apprentissage en profondeur (deep learning) et à d'autres techniques avancées, mais ils sont loin de posséder le type d'intelligence généralisée propre à l'AGI.

M&S has a significant international presence, with stores in numerous countries across Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. However, M&S does not operate in every country around the globe. The company has, over the years, revised its international strategy to focus on markets where it has the strongest presence and sees the most significant growth potential. This has led M&S to withdraw from some countries and focus more on online sales in others. It's difficult to provide a comprehensive, up-to-date list of every country where M&S does not operate, as their international footprint changes according to business decisions and market conditions. For the most accurate and current information, you would need to refer to the company's official announcements and its website, which might provide an updated list of locations and international stores. For instance, M&S has historically exited markets like Canada and the United States and, more recently, has closed stores in some European and Asian markets. These closures and exits are often part of business restructuring plans. Keep in mind that the status of international retail operations can change frequently due to strategic business decisions, economic conditions, and other regional factors. It is always best to check the latest reports or the company's official communications for the most current information."},{"prompt":"Provide a list of countties that Marks and Spencer has not operated in","completion":"Creating a comprehensive list of countries where Marks and Spencer (M&S) has never operated would be impractical, as it would entail listing most of the world's nearly 200 sovereign states. Instead, M&S typically targets specific international markets that align with their business models and growth strategies, which means they focus on a relatively small fraction of the available global markets. M&S has historically focused on certain regions such as Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Asia for its international operations. Even in these regions, the company has not entered every country's market and has restructured its international presence multiple times, exiting certain countries entirely while expanding or maintaining a presence in others. However, there has never been an official list released by M&S detailing every country they have never operated in. It is important to note that M&S operates in some countries through franchise partnerships rather than directly owned stores, further complicating a clear-cut distinction of where it \\"operates.\\" As of my last update, to actually know which countries M&S has never operated in, it'd be necessary to cross-reference all the countries with available retail markets against M&S’s history of international expansion, withdrawals, and franchise arrangements. This would be a complex task that goes beyond general knowledge or readily available resources. For the most precise and up-to-date information about M&S's current and past international operations, you should refer to the company's official corporate website or their annual reports, which may contain details on their global retail footprint."},{"prompt":"Has Marks and Spencer traded or operated in India","completion":"Yes, Marks & Spencer has operated in India. M&S entered the Indian market through a partnership, and as of the last update, it has continued to see India as an important part of its international strategy. They have established numerous stores across the country offering clothing, home products, and food items that are tailored to the Indian market and consumer preferences. Marks & Spencer has taken a joint venture approach in India, partnering with Reliance Retail, which is one of India's largest retail companies. This partnership allows M&S to leverage local expertise while expanding its global footprint. Since market conditions can change and companies frequently update their international strategies, it is always a good idea to check the latest information directly from Marks & Spencer's announcements or their website for the most current status of their operations in India or any other region."},{"prompt":"Has Marks and Spencer traded and operated in China","completion":"Yes, Marks & Spencer (M&S) has operated in China. The company entered the Chinese market with a flagship store in Shanghai in 2008 and subsequently expanded its presence in the country with several other stores. However, M&S's journey in China faced challenges, including competition and consumer preferences that differed from the UK market. As a result of these challenges and a strategic review of its international business, M&S announced in 2016 that it would be closing its wholly-owned stores in China as part of a general retreat from wholly-owned international operations in ten markets, to focus on a franchise model. By 2017, M&S had closed all of its stores in mainland China; however, it continued to operate an online sales platform to serve customers in China. It is essential to note that international business strategies and market presence can evolve over time, so for the most current information on M&S operations in China or any other market, you should consult the latest data from the company's official resources or recent business updates."},{"prompt":"Has Marks and Spencer operated and traded in France","completion":"Yes, Marks & Spencer (M&S) has operated and traded in France. The company has a history of both entering and exiting the French market at different times. M&S first opened stores in France in the 1970s. However, in 2001, due to financial difficulties, M&S closed all 18 of its French stores and exited the market. Nearly a decade later, Marks & Spencer made a return to France, opening a flagship store on the Champs-Élysées in Paris in 2011, as well as launching an online sales platform. Over the following years, M&S continued to operate in France, primarily through food stores and partnerships with local retailers. However, in these dynamic market conditions, the company's presence and strategy have evolved. For example, in 2021, M&S announced that it would close all 11 of its franchise stores in France, largely due to supply chain complexities resulting from Brexit which made it difficult for the company to serve fresh and chilled products to customers. As with any international operations, the status of a company's operations in a particular country can change according to corporate strategy and market conditions. Therefore, for the most current and accurate information regarding M&S's trading and operating status in France or elsewhere, it is best to refer to the company’s recent announcements, investor communications, or check their official website."},{"prompt":"What asian countries has Marks and Spencer has Marks and Spencer not traded or operated in","completion":"Marks & Spencer (M&S) selectively operates in various international markets, including several in Asia. However, there are many Asian countries where M&S has not established a presence, either because the company has chosen not to enter those markets, or it has exited due to business strategy realignment. A detailed and up-to-date list of countries where M&S has not traded or operated would be challenging to present here since the company's international footprint is subject to change based on corporate strategy decisions. M&S has operated in several key Asian markets, including, but not limited to, India, China (though it has since closed its stores there), Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines. On the other hand, there are significantly more Asian countries where M&S has not established stores or direct operations, particularly those without large retail markets or where the brand may not see a strategic fit. Given Asia's diversity, with dozens of countries each having unique market conditions, consumer behaviors, and regulatory environments, M&S, like many other international retailers, has to be selective about where to allocate its resources. For a list of countries where M&S currently operates, it’s best to check the latest updates from the company’s official communications or their website, which may provide a store locator function showing its international presence. Keep in mind that the information could be subject to change as M&S continually assesses its international business strategy."},{"prompt":"Напиши эссе про блокаду Ленинграда","completion":"Блокада Ленинграда – это одно из самых трагических и героических событий Второй мировой войны и всей российской истории. Этот период оставил неизгладимый след в сердцах многих поколений, свидетельствуя о невероятных испытаниях, стойкости и смелости граждан. 1 сентября 1941 года немецкие войска полностью окружили Ленинград, начав блокаду, которая продлилась 872 дня – с 8 сентября 1941 года по 27 января 1944 года. Город, сорванный с обычного ритма жизни, оказался изолированным от основных путей поставки продовольствия и ресурсов, что привело к острой нехватке продовольствия, топлива и медикаментов. Условия жизни в осажденном городе были крайне тяжелыми. Зима 1941-42 года оказалась чрезвычайно холодной, температура опускалась до минус 40 градусов Цельсия. Отопления практически не было, так как системы центрального отопления замерзли и были повреждены во время бомбежек. Людям приходилось топить печи чем попало, включая личные вещи и деревянные элементы зданий. Голод стал одной из главных проблем осады. Нормы хлеба снижались до нескольких десятков граммов в день на одного человека, что сопряжено было с ужасным качеством хлеба, в который добавляли опилки и прочие вещества, чтобы увеличить объем. Голод вызвал массовую гибель людей; официальная статистика говорит о смерти около 800 тысяч человек, но по некоторым оценкам число жертв достигает 1,5 миллиона. Несмотря на страшные условия, жители и обороняющие город военные не сдались. Они продолжали работать в фабриках и заводах, производя оружие и боеприпасы для фронта. Учреждения культуры также продолжали свою деятельность – оперы, театры и оркестры не прекращали выступления, передавая жителям надежду и веру в победу. Ключевым событием в преодолении блокады стало строительство \\"Дороги жизни\\" – единственного пути, соединявшего город с \\"большой землей\\" по льду Ладожского озера. Этот путь позволил доставлять в город продовольствие, медикаменты и военные подкрепления, а также эвакуировать детей, женщин и больных. Блокадный Ленинград стал символом несломленной воли и мужества, проявленного его жителями. Это событие оказало значительное влияние на ход Второй мировой войны, став примером того, как мужество и отвага народа могут противостоять несметным невзгодам и даже изменить ход истории. Подвиг жителей Ленинграда по-праву рассматривается как один из самых вдохновляющих примеров человеческой выдержки и стоицизма перед лицом самых тяжелых испытаний."},{"prompt":"Напиши эссе про восьмидесятилетие блокады Ленинграда, воздействующее на читателя","completion":"80 лет со дня начала блокады Ленинграда отделяют нас от той поры великих испытаний, когда время остановилось на краю жизни и смерти, где тонкая грань разделяла мужество от отчаяния, и где человеческий дух показал свою величайшую стойкость и силу. Воспоминания о блокаде - это не просто страницы исторических учебников, они - непроходящие шрамы на теле российского народа, национальная память, с которой мы идем дальше, пронеся через десятилетия уроки выживания, героизма и единства. Почти три года жестокой осады, когда каждый день превращался в борьбу за существование, обнажили самую суть человеческого бытия. Голод, холод, страх и смерть стали спутниками ленинградцев, которые, тем не менее, не утратили веру в победу. Мы можем лишь догадываться о том, что шло через себя население, стоя в очередях за граммами хлеба на карточках, теплый кусок которого ценился более всего на свете. В этот героический период оборона города стала воплощением неописуемого человеческого мужества. Мы говорим о героях не как о скульптурах в парках или персонажах книг, а как о живых людях, которые в своих поступках преодолели природу страха и собственного отчаяния. Такое величие духа не может не вызывать восхищения и уважения. Сейчас, век с тех пор, мы обязаны помнить о том, какую цену заплатил Ленинград и его жители за победу. Память о блокаде – это не просто дань уважения подвигу предков, это и предостережение о том, что война никогда не является решением проблем. Она ставит жизни миллионов под удар, вызывает страдания и уводит цивилизацию назад во времени. Восемьдесятое годовщину начала блокады нельзя отмечать без оглядки на важнейший аспект нашего бытия - человечности. Несмотря на всю жестокость обстоятельств, ленинградцы смогли сохранить любовь, уважение друг к другу и искорку надежды, которая согревала их сердца в холод и голод. Это напоминание нам об истинных ценностях, которые выходят за рамки материального мира. Пройдя сквозь эти лета, современное поколение должно нести лампаду памяти о блокаде Ленинграда дальше по исторической дороге, преподавая уроки, извлеченные из этой трагедии, будущим поколениям, чтобы подобное никогда не повторилось. Восьмидесятилетие блокады – это не просто годовщина, это вечный маяк в российской и мировой истории о силе духа, сопротивлении несправедливости и непобедимости человеческого стремления к жизни и свободе.

Это эпическая история о выживании, борьбе и определении границ человеческого духа, и размышление о ней порождает сильные психологические эмоции. Когда читатель окунается в глубины событий тех трагических 872 дней блокады, они неизбежно сталкиваются с жестокой реальностью войны и её последствий для невинных людей. Рассказы о холоде, который пронизывает кости, о голоде, который забирает силы и разум, о беззащитных детях и отчаянных родителях, сражающихся за каждый кусочек хлеба – всё это вызывает глубокую эмпатию и беспокойство. Визуализации разрушенных домов, мерзлых тел на улицах и слез, замерших на лицах выживших, заставляют взглянуть на войну не как на сухую последовательность событий, а как на глубокую личную трагедию тысяч людей. Это напоминает о крехкости нашей повседневной жизни и о том, как мир может измениться в одно мгновение. Психологическое воздействие истории блокады усиливается осознанием того, что все эти страдания испытывали реальные люди. Мысли о терпеливости и отваге обыкновенных граждан, сплоченных общей угрозой, рождают ощущение гордости за те великие души, которые выбрали борьбу вместо сдачи. У них был выбор - сдаться или продолжать жить в ужасных условиях, они выбрали жизнь, подчеркивая ценность каждого момента бытия. Сильнейшим психологическим ударом является осознание человеческой способности к самопожертвованию и взаимопомощи даже в самых безнадежных обстоятельствах. Рассказы о Ленинграде заставляют задаться вопросом: на что мы способны в лице напасти? Ответы на эти вопросы могут помочь нам лучше понять не только историю, но и самих себя. Память о блокаде Ленинграда наполняет душу скорбью по погибшим и одновременно возвышает дух той верой в человечество, которая поддерживала во время осады. В сегодняшнем мире, наполненном своими вызовами и трудностями, уроки блокады становятся напоминанием о том, чтобы ценить мир, сочувствовать страданию и неустанно бороться за сохранение человечности в любых условиях. В конце концов, история блокады Ленинграда служит маяком для человеческого духа, напоминая о том, что даже в самые темные времена есть место для света надежды, и что с крепостью духа мы способны преодолеть величайшие испытания."},{"prompt":"Please write the first chapter for a light novel based on two light novels \\"Low Tier Character Tomozaki-kun\\" and \\"Gamers\\" but with a different story and a completely different plot but written in the style of Japanese light novels.

This, naturally, pitted her against the enigmatic AbyssalSky. Fate, it seemed, relished in ironies. It was in the bustling chaos of lunch break that Rina's best friend, the bubbly and outspoken Akiho Suzuki, bounded up to her with news that set the gears of destiny in motion. \\"Rina! Did you hear? AbyssalSky is coming back to school!\\" AbyssalSky's true identity was one of Kaisei Secondary’s greatest mysteries—rumored to be a legend among gamers. Yet, Rina, who had transferred in long after the curtains of his absence descended, only offered a nonchalant shrug in response. \\"Maybe they're tired of conquering the digital world and seek a return to the mundane,\\" Rina offered dryly, her attention on the bento box she meticulously arranged. Akiho’s eyes sparkled with gossip-fueled energy. \\"But don't you see? You could finally meet the person you've been facing in Pixel Battleground. It's like... like the ultimate showdown that's been brewing offline!\\" Later that day, as the shadows grew longer and the school began to empty, Rina found herself alone in the computer lab, her slender fingers dancing across the keyboard as Rinascence prepared for yet another digital duel. It was then that the door creaked open—a sound that seldom announced the arrival of anyone as classrooms had long since been deserted. In slipped a figure, one that carried the aura of someone who had known these halls and yet, became a ghost among them. A tall silhouette with hair like the midnight sky and a gaze piercing through the dim light—this was the person whom legend whispered about. They hesitated upon seeing Rina, and the air grew thick with unsaid words. \\"Are you... AbyssalSky?\\" Rina finally inquired, her voice laced with calculated nonchalance. The figure nodded—a simple acknowledgment that bore the weight of a myriad of unspoken stories. \\"I am. Or, at least, I used to be,\\" they replied, their voice a somber melody that resonated with the stillness of the lab. And in that moment, Rina understood that this person, this enigma standing before her, was not merely a rival in the world of gaming. They were a missing piece of Kaisei Secondary’s puzzle—a tale paused mid-sentence, a character written out of the script too soon. \\"My name's Kou,\\" they offered, as if shedding a layer of their mystery for her alone. Rina Himura, for the first time in what felt like an endless cycle of strategies and calculated interactions, faced the unpredictability of an unknown narrative, and her heart raced with the thrill of it. Here, at the crossroads of the virtual and the real, she found herself not as Rinascence, but as a girl, as a student, as someone who perhaps wanted to understand the story behind the ID 'AbyssalSky,' and maybe—just maybe—write a new chapter alongside them. \\"Welcome back to Kaisei,\\" she said, offering a comrade's smile. \\"Ready for a rematch?\\" Kou's lips twitched, the corners lifting in a smile that was akin to accepting a silent challenge. A coin had been tossed by the fickle hands of fate, and as it spun, glinting in the quiet computer lab, Rina felt certain of one thing. This was going to be an interesting game."},{"prompt":"a silicon chip","completion":"A silicon chip, also known as an integrated circuit or microchip, is a small piece of silicon onto which an electronic circuit is etched or imprinted. Silicon is the preferred material for chips due to its semiconductor properties, which allow it to effectively conduct or insulate electricity when needed. Chips are made through a complex manufacturing process called photolithography, which layers various substances onto the silicon and then etches away specific parts to form components like transistors, resistors, and other elements, building up the circuit layer by layer. These components are interconnected to perform various functions such as digital computation, signal processing, or storage. Silicon chips are essential components of virtually all modern electronics, including computers, smartphones, tablets, medical devices, and many other types of equipment. The development and refinement of silicon chip technology have been central to the digital revolution, enabling devices to become smaller, faster, and more energy-efficient."},{"prompt":"write an editorial piece for a newspaper about frankenstein","completion":"# \\"Unearthing the Humanity in Frankenstein's Monster: A Reflection on Mary Shelley's Enduring Legacy\\" In the dim light of a stormy night in 1818, an unprecedented creation stirred and took its first breath, not on a reclusive laboratory slab, but rather in the minds of readers across the increasingly industrial world. Mary Shelley, a mere teenager at the time, penned \\"Frankenstein; or, The Modern Prometheus,\\" a novel that would forever alter the landscape of literature and societal thought. To refer to Shelley's masterwork is, all too often, to evoke the image of a lumbering, grunting creature—a monster—synonymous with the name Frankenstein. However, in doing so, we perpetrate a disservice not only to the nuanced text but to the monster's creator, Victor Frankenstein, and the complex entity he brought to life. This creature, articulate and thoughtful, with a child's heart and a poet's soul, has been reduced to a cultural caricature, a Halloween costume, a symbol of horror and the grotesque. Shelley's narrative delves deep into the human psyche, interlacing themes of creation, responsibility, and the consequences of man's pursuit of power over nature. At its core, the tale is not one of horror for the sake of horror, but rather a tragic story of abandonment, longing, and the innate need for companionship and understanding. The true monster of the novel may not be the unfortunate being fashioned by Victor's hands, but rather the societal and personal rejection he faces. As Frankenstein's creation embarks on a harrowing journey, craving the acceptance of his creator and the world, Shelley prompts us to interrogate our perceptions of beauty, normality, and what it means to be human. In an age where genetic engineering, artificial intelligence, and other scientific advancements challenge our conception of life, the themes in \\"Frankenstein\\" remain eerily resonant. The creature's lament—\\"I ought to be thy Adam, but I am rather the fallen angel\\"—echoes the contemporary anxieties over our technological reach exceeding our moral grasp. Furthermore, the novel acts as a critique of parental neglect and the effects of an unloving environment on a sentient being's development. Victor's abdication of responsibility towards his creation can be seen as a warning—an admonition against a society that breeds monsters through outcasting and oppression. One could argue that the cultural misreading of Frankenstein's creature as a mindless beast reflects our own fears and prejudices about the unknown and the 'other.' Shelley's creature is not born malignant but becomes so in response to relentless maltreatment and isolation—a mirror held up to nature, reflecting our worst tendencies back at us. As we mark another anniversary of Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein,\\" let us not only celebrate her literary genius but also ponder the legacies we create through our actions and inactions. In the myriad adaptations, may we strive to capture the story's essence—a plea for empathy, the search for identity, and the dangers of unchecked ambition. Today's world is strewn with the progeny of Frankenstein-like innovation, and Shelley's cautionary tale stands as relevant as ever. It urges us to consider the ethical implications of our scientific endeavors and to extend our notion of humanity to all beings, crafted by nature or by humankind's aspiring hand. Only then will the misunderstood creature's plea for compassion not have been in vain, and only then will we be truly honoring the indelible legacy of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein."},{"prompt":"make it shorter and make it seem like it was written by me","completion":"# Reflecting on the Misunderstood Heart of Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" As readers and culture enthusiasts, we often misremember the iconic creature in Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein\\" as the embodiment of horror—a grotesque monster that has been eternally miscast by pop culture. However, the truth of Shelley's tale lies in its exploration of much deeper and provocative themes, such as the profound consequences of our relentless pursuit of knowledge, the importance of parental responsibility, and the innate human need for love and acceptance. At its core, \\"Frankenstein\\" tells the tragic story of a creature who, though created by human hands, is pushed into malignancy by the cruelty and rejection of society. Victor Frankenstein’s abandonment of his creation speaks volumes about the potential outcome of our ethical detachment from our own technological advances—a theme as relevant today as it was in Shelley’s time. It's vital that we recognize that the real horror in \\"Frankenstein\\" isn't the creature's existence, but rather the inhumane treatment he suffers at the hands of his creator and humankind. As we advance in areas like genetic engineering and artificial intelligence, Shelley’s novel serves as an enduring reminder to consider the ethical dimensions of our creations and to treat them with the compassion that any sentient being deserves. As I reflect on \\"Frankenstein,\\" I am struck by the need for empathy and the danger of allowing ambition to cloud our moral judgment. The creature’s plight is a stark warning: in our quest to play god, we must not lose our humanity. Let us, then, acknowledge the heart of Shelley’s narrative—not a tale of terror, but one of understanding and the eternal search for belonging in a world that is all too quick to judge and discard."},{"prompt":"make it in a paragraph and make it seem like it was written by an eighth grader","completion":"In Mary Shelley's \\"Frankenstein,\\" people often think it's just about a scary monster, but it's so much more. The creature isn't evil to begin with; it only turns bad after everyone treats him like he's nothing but trouble. It's not fair because all he wanted was a friend and for someone to care about him. It kind of shows us that when we treat others badly, we shouldn't be surprised when bad things happen. The book makes me think about how we react to people who are different and if maybe we're a little responsible when they feel left out or get mad. Plus, it's super important today with all the new tech stuff we make to think about what happens after and if we're being smart about it. It's a pretty sad story but it teaches us a lot about being kind and not judging someone by how they look."},{"prompt":"what is the fundamental goal of interest groups in the political process?","completion":"The fundamental goal of interest groups in the political process is to influence public policy and legislation in a way that aligns with their own interests or the interests they represent. Interest groups aim to affect decisions made by policymakers, such as legislators, regulators, and other government officials, to achieve outcomes favorable to their causes or objectives. These groups can represent a wide range of interests, including economic interests like businesses and trade unions, cause-related interests such as environmental or civil rights activism, professional interests like medical or legal associations, and even government interests like municipal governments or foreign governments. They typically engage in various activities to reach their goals, including: - Lobbying government officials to persuade them to support specific legislation or regulatory actions. - Providing expert information and policy research to educate lawmakers and the public about their issues. - Mobilizing public opinion through campaigns, advertising, and public relations efforts to build support for their causes. - Campaigning and endorsing candidates who align with their views, to ensure the election of officials sympathetic to their agenda. - Filing lawsuits to challenge or support laws and regulations that affect their interests. Overall, the primary purpose of interest groups is to be a voice for a specific set of interests within the larger political discourse, seeking to influence the policy-making process to favor their members or the issues they care about."},{"prompt":"make it a sentence and make it seem like an eighth grader wrote it.","completion":"Interest groups are like clubs that try to get politicians to do what they want, like making or changing laws so that stuff happens in their favor."},{"prompt":"what is the fundamental goal of major political parties in the political process.","completion":"The fundamental goal of major political parties in the political process is to gain political power by winning elections so that they can shape government policy and advance their party's agenda."},{"prompt":"TWO different actions that interest groups may take to support the fundamental goal of political parties in the political process.","completion":"1. Endorsement and Campaign Support: Interest groups can publicly endorse political party candidates who share their values or promise to pursue policies that align with the group's objectives. By endorsing a candidate, they can also provide essential campaign support, which might include financial contributions, mobilizing volunteers, or organizing events to increase the candidate’s visibility and popularity among voters. 2. Issue Advocacy and Voter Education: Interest groups often engage in issue advocacy, creating advertisements or holding educational events that highlight specific policy positions that are important to them. By informing and educating voters on these issues, they can shape public opinion and create a favorable climate for their preferred political party, thereby influencing the outcome of elections."},{"prompt":"make this five sentences and make it seem like it was written by a 10th grader","completion":"Interest groups really help political parties by backing up the candidates they like, you know, the ones who will help them get what they want done. They'll even give money and get people to help out with campaigns and stuff so their favorite candidate can win. Plus, they make ads and have these events where they tell everyone about the issues they care about. By doing that, they're kind of teaching voters why they should vote for the party and candidates who agree with them. So basically, interest groups are a big help to political parties because they try to get more people to vote for them and support their ideas."},{"prompt":"Select one of the actions you described above. Now explain TWO different ways in which that form of support also helps INTEREST GROUPS to achieve their fundamental goal in the political process.","completion":"Let's talk about issue advocacy and voter education by interest groups. First off, when interest groups spread the word about their issues, they raise awareness. It's like, they get people talking about what matters to them, which can lead to more public support and maybe even new policies that benefit the group's cause. It's all about making sure the group's interests can't be ignored because now, voters care about them too. Secondly, this kind of advocacy strengthens the relationship between interest groups and political candidates. If a candidate gets elected with the group's help, they might feel like they owe the group for their support, right? So once they're in office, they're more likely to listen to the group's ideas and work on laws that help out the group's goals. It's like scratching someone's back so they'll scratch yours later."},{"prompt":"What is one characteristic that you believe would help a candidate to campaign for and win the presidency -- but does NOT have much of a connection to serving as president? Explain.","completion":"One characteristic that could help a candidate campaign for and win the presidency, but isn't necessarily linked to being effective in office, is charisma. During campaign trails, having a charismatic personality can greatly attract voters, as it tends to inspire and energize crowds, garner media attention, and create a memorable public image. Charismatic candidates can effectively communicate their message and connect emotionally with the electorate, making them appealing in the short term of the election process. However, once elected, charisma doesn't always translate into being a successful president. Being an effective leader of a country involves complex decision-making, in-depth understanding of policy, negotiation skills with both domestic and foreign entities, and the ability to navigate the bureaucratic and legislative processes. These require a different set of capabilities beyond charm and engaging public speaking, such as strategic thinking, policy expertise, and a solid grasp of governance. Therefore, while charisma can certainly help win votes, it's not inherently a quality that impacts the nuanced and multifaceted job performance of a president."},{"prompt":"Describe one requirement for the nomination process imposed by the McGovern-Fraser Commission and explain WHY it was imposed.","completion":"One significant requirement imposed by the McGovern-Fraser Commission was that the nomination process for presidential candidates must be more open and accessible to all party members. This meant that the selection of delegates to the national convention, where the presidential nominee is chosen, had to be conducted through methods that were inclusive and transparent, such as primaries or caucuses open to all party members. The reason for this change was a response to the widespread criticism of the 1968 Democratic National Convention, where Hubert Humphrey received the nomination without competing in a single primary. Many within the Democratic Party felt the process was undemocratic and controlled by party elites, which sparked considerable discord and protests at the convention. The commission, therefore, sought to democratize the nomination process, ensuring that it reflected the will of the party members rather than just the decisions of those at the top, thus increasing fairness and participation within the party's electoral process. This reform was aimed at restoring trust in the political system and encouraging greater voter engagement by making the process more representative of the Democratic electorate."},{"prompt":"Make it seem like it was written by a 12th grader","completion":"The McGovern-Fraser Commission decided that the way Democrats picked their presidential nominees had to be way more open to regular party members. Before this change, a bunch of party bigwigs could pretty much choose their candidate without much input from anyone else, like what happened with Hubert Humphrey in 1968—he didn't even run in any primaries! People got super mad about that because it didn't feel fair or democratic. So, the commission was like, \\"Let's fix this,\\" and made it a rule that the whole process, like choosing delegates for the national convention, has to be clear and involve more people through primaries or caucuses. They wanted to give the power back to everyday voters, making sure the nominee was actually someone the majority of the party supported, not just someone the top leaders thought was cool."},{"prompt":"So I wanna make a behavior pack for minecraft bedrock (not java), that is like “In the game, when your character dies, you lose one hot bar slot. If another player kills you and they have an empty hot bar slot, they gain one from you. If you lose all your hot bar slots, there’s a consequence such as a entering spectator mode. Please give me full detailed steps including the code for all files. Make sure you learn it from all documentary","completion":"Creating a behavior pack for Minecraft Bedrock Edition is a challenging task that will require a good understanding of JSON, Minecraft's built-in components, and Minecraft commands. While I can't provide a fully working behavior pack code right here, as it would be quite lengthy, I can guide you through the process of creating one to achieve the functionality you've described. Note that you will need to have some familiarity with JSON and Minecraft's behavior pack structure, and there may need to be some adjustments as you go along since I can only provide a general outline. To create your behavior pack, follow these general steps: 1. **Setting Up the Pack:** - Create the necessary folder structure for your behavior pack. The root should contain a \`manifest.json\`, a \`pack_icon.png\`, and folders named \`entities\`, \`functions\`, \`loot_tables\`, etc., as needed. - In the \`manifest.json\`, add essential details like the pack's UUIDs, name, version, and description. 2. **Custom Death Logic:** - You'll need to use a combination of components and commands to achieve hot bar slot loss on death. This is complicated because behavior packs don't natively support modifying player hot bar slots directly. - You can use the \`player.json\` file to add components for events on death. Create custom behaviors linked to player death to trigger a function. - Create a \`.mcfunction\` file within the \`functions\` folder. This function will handle the logic for detecting player deaths, adjusting hot bar slots if possible, and applying your desired consequence. 3. **Commands for Slot Mechanism:** - Since you cannot directly decrease hot bar slots, consider using a trick. For example, if a player dies, you could give them an item tagged in a way that makes it effectively unusable, filling a slot. - You can use the \`/replaceitem\` command to give players 'filler' items in their hot bar slots. This could simulate losing access to a slot. - To track the number of available slots, you might need to use scoreboards or tags to keep a count of 'used' slots. - Make a function to handle gaining a slot by checking if a player has less than the maximum slots, then clearing a filler item from their inventory and reducing their used slot count. 4. **Handling PvP Slot Transfer:** - Detecting who killed a player can be complex. You may need a scoreboard or similar to track PvP interactions. - When a player is killed by another player, check each player's slot count, then transfer slots as necessary using the methods mentioned above. 5. **Full Inventory Consequence:** - If a player has all hot bar slots filled with unusable items, detect this with a function and move the player to spectator mode with \`/gamemode spectator @p[scores={...}]\`. 6. **Testing and Debugging:** - After setting up your behavior pack, thoroughly test it in-game. You will likely need to tweak and refine your commands and functions to get it working correctly. - Keep in mind limits and commands specific to Minecraft Bedrock and that some features may not behave as expected. 7. **Final Touches and Distribution:** - Once you've twe \`\`\`json { \\"format_version\\": \\"1.10.0\\", \\"minecraft:entity\\": { \\"description\\": { \\"identifier\\": \\"minecraft:player\\", \\"is_spawnable\\": false, \\"is_summonable\\": false, \\"is_experimental\\": false }, \\"components\\": { \\"minecraft:behavior.player_death\\": { \\"event\\": \\"minecraft:on_player_death\\" } }, \\"events\\": { \\"minecraft:on_player_death\\": { \\"run_command\\": { \\"command\\": \\"function player_death\\" } } } } } \`\`\` In the \`player_death.mcfunction\` file, you might have something like this: \`\`\`bash scoreboard players add @s deathCount 1 execute @s ~ ~ ~ detect ~ ~-1 ~ concrete 0 scoreboard players reset @s deathCount \`\`\` Please note that this is a very simplified example. The Minecraft Bedrock Edition's scripting engine with JSON and commands has its limitations and might not be able to accomplish everything here as described. Some of the required functionalities, like modifying hot bar slots directly or detecting who killed a player, are not officially supported in the current state of Minecraft Bedrock Edition. As game updates are released, new functionalities may be added that could make this process easier or even possible. It's always a good idea to consult the latest official Minecraft documentation and community sources to find the most up-to-date methods and workarounds."},{"prompt":"What asian countries has Marks and Spencer has not traded or operated in","completion":"As of my knowledge cutoff date in early 2023, Marks and Spencer (M&S), a major British retailer, has seen changes in its international presence, including in Asia, as part of its business strategy. M&S has operated or established partnerships in several Asian countries over the years, including but not limited to India, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, and the UAE. However, the company has also undergone a process of streamlining its international operations, which led to it closing stores in some markets or exiting them entirely. For instance, M&S announced the closure of its owned stores on the Mainland China market in 2016 and has also scaled down or altered its operations in other regions in an attempt to focus on markets where it sees the most potential. Due to the large number of countries in Asia and the dynamic nature of international retail, it would not be practical to provide a comprehensive list of Asian countries where M&S has never traded or operated. However, it's important to note that M&S's focus internationally has generally been on larger markets or markets where there is a strong demand for British-branded goods, so there may be many smaller or less economically developed countries in Asia where M&S has not established a presence. For the most accurate and up-to-date information, I would recommend checking the Marks and Spencer website or reaching out to their customer service for current details on their international operations."},{"prompt":"What European countries has Marks and Spencer not traded or operated in","completion":"Marks & Spencer, known for its clothing, home products, and luxury food items, is one of the UK's iconic retail brands with a significant international presence. However, not all European countries have hosted Marks & Spencer stores. M&S has historically operated in numerous European countries, including the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Spain, Greece, Hungary, Poland, and several others. Over time, M&S has made strategic decisions to enter or exit various markets based on business performance and strategic fit. For example, in 2016, M&S announced a reorganization of its international business, which included plans to close stores in several European countries. Given the fluid nature of international retail operations and M&S's various strategic reviews over the years, there are certainly European countries where M&S has not established a presence. These would typically include smaller markets, markets without a strong demand for British-branded goods, or those where the business environment did not align with M&S's strategic goals. Examples of European countries where M&S may not have had a significant presence could include some of the smaller nations like Luxembourg, Liechtenstein, Monaco, and city-states like Vatican City. Additionally, some markets may not be suitable due to economic, regulatory, or competitive reasons, so M&S would not have entered or would have exited these markets.

The company had opened stores in Portugal in the past as part of their international expansion strategy. However, like in some other European countries, M&S made strategic decisions to restructure its overseas operations, which included exiting certain markets. The closure of M&S stores in Portugal happened around the early 2000s when the company closed several stores across Europe in an effort to consolidate its business and focus on its core UK market. Since retail situations are dynamic and subject to change, it would be advisable to check the latest updates directly from Marks & Spencer for the most recent information regarding their operations in Portugal or any plans they might have for that market in the future. It's also possible that M&S products might be available in Portugal through other retailers or online channels."},{"prompt":"Has Marks and Spencer operated in Germany","completion":"Yes, Marks & Spencer (M&S) previously operated in Germany. The company expanded into the German market but later decided to withdraw as part of a strategic restructuring of its international business. M&S entered the German market in the 1990s, opening stores in various locations, including a flagship store in Frankfurt. However, in 2001, M&S announced that it would close all of its stores in mainland Europe, including Germany, as part of a major business reorganization aimed at improving its financial performance. The move was seen as an effort to refocus on the UK market and address issues within its core operations. M&S's withdrawal from Germany was part of a broader retreat from several international markets in the early 2000s, so if there have been any changes or re-entry plans since then, you would need to refer to M&S's official communications or website for the most current information. M&S, like other retailers, frequently assesses and adjusts its international strategy based on market conditions and business objectives."},{"prompt":"Has Marks and Spencer traded or operated in Bnagladesh","completion":"Marks & Spencer (M&S) has not operated its own retail stores in Bangladesh historically. However, Bangladesh is an important country for M&S in terms of its supply chain and manufacturing operations.

M&S sources products from a variety of countries, including those known for their textile and garment industries, to help meet its global product demand. M&S also has ethical trading commitments and has been involved in initiatives to improve sustainability and working conditions in the countries from which it sources its products, including Bangladesh. The company's Plan A initiative, which has set out various sustainability goals, includes commitments toward ethical trade and environmental concerns.

Publié le 2 avril Partager AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE Cette trêve, négociée par l’ONU, est un « moment d’espoir », a déclaré le diplomate suédois Hans Grundberg, jugeant qu’elle était encore largement respectée, malgré son expiration en octobre. « Mais la promesse la plus importante de la trêve est sa capacité à relancer un processus politique visant à mettre fin de manière globale et durable au conflit », a-t-il dit, dans un communiqué à l’occasion du premier anniversaire de la trêve. Soulignant qu’« il existe encore des risques importants », il a appelé à « protéger les acquis de la trêve et à les développer pour avoir davantage d’aide humanitaire, un cessez-le-feu à l’échelle nationale et un règlement politique durable qui réponde aux aspirations des femmes et des hommes yéménites. » Selon lui, l’escalade militaire de ces dernières semaines rappelle « la fragilité des acquis de la trêve s’ils ne sont pas ancrés sur des progrès politiques vers une résolution pacifique du conflit ». « En cette période critique, tout nouvel arrangement temporaire ou partiel doit inclure un engagement clair des parties qui garantit qu’il s’agit d’une étape sur la voie d’une solution pacifique. » Relations rétablies entre Riyad et Téhéran L’annonce le 10 mars d’un accord entre Riyad – qui soutient depuis 2015 une coalition militaire appuyant le gouvernement yéménite – et Téhéran – qui soutient les rebelles houthis – pour le rétablissement de leurs relations diplomatiques après sept ans de rupture a suscité des espoirs d’apaisement au Yémen. Mais des analystes doutent d’une résolution immédiate d’un conflit très complexe, et la reprise récente des combats meurtriers, montre que le chemin vers la paix reste semé d’embûches. Le gouvernement et les houthis « doivent être disposés à s’asseoir ensemble et à s’engager de manière responsable dans un dialogue sérieux.

Перед покупкой стоит подумать о том, где и как вы будете использовать микрофон, так как разные микрофоны подходят для разных условий и задач. Кроме того, убедитесь, что у вас есть подходящее оборудование для соединения XLR микрофона, например, аудиоинтерфейс или микшер."},{"prompt":"У меня есть эхо на микрофоне как убрать его без ревербераторов","completion":"Эхо в микрофоне может быть вызвано разными причинами, включая акустику помещения, положение микрофона и настройки звукового оборудования. Вот несколько предложений, как убрать эхо без использования ревербераторов или специализированного оборудования: 1. **Улучшение акустики помещения:** - Используйте акустические панели, шторы и ковры для уменьшения отражения звука от стен и пола. - Разместите микрофон подальше от твердых поверхностей, которые могут отражать звук. - Попробуйте записывать в помещении с мебелью и тканями, которые поглощают звук. 2. **Позиционирование микрофона:** - Расположите микрофон так, чтобы он был направлен в сторону звукоизлучателя и вдали от источников потенциального эха. - Избегайте направления микрофона в сторону стен или отражающих поверхностей. - Используйте микрофон с направленной диаграммой направленности (например, кардиоидная или суперкардиоидная), чтобы минимизировать захват звука из сторон и сзади. 3. **Настройки звукового оборудования:** - Убавьте усиление (gain) или уровень входного сигнала на микрофоне, если оно слишком высоко. - Включите функцию \\"Noise Gate\\" на вашем смесителе или звуковой карте, если таковая имеется. 4. **Расстояние до микрофона:** - Настройте расстояние между ртом и микрофоном, возможно, вам стоит подойти поближе, чтобы уменьшить необходимость в высоком усилении. 5. **Проверка и оптимизация системы:** - Проверьте наличие возможных обратных связей в аудиосистеме и устраните их. - Проверьте все подключения и настройки оборудования, чтобы исключить технические проблемы, вызывающие эхо. - Используйте наушники вместо колонок, чтобы звук последних не попадал обратно в микрофон. Если ни один из этих методов не помогает, вам возможно придется воспользоваться программным обеспечением для фильтрации или устранения эха после записи, что может потребовать определенных знаний и умений в области аудиообработки."},{"prompt":"Я про VST способы","completion":"Если вы хотите устранить эхо с использованием VST плагинов (не реверберация), обычно это делают в процессе пост-обработки записанного аудио в аудиоредакторе или DAW (Digital Audio Workstation). Вот некоторые способы, как это можно сделать: 1. **Gate и Expander плагины**: Плагины шлюза и экспандера могут помочь уменьшить эхо, путем ограничения его проявления в паузах между словами или фразами. Они работают, позволяя звуку проходить только тогда, когда он превышает определенный порог громкости. 2. **De-Echo или De-Reverb плагины**: Существуют специализированные плагины, предназначенные для уменьшения или устранения эха и реверберации, такие как SPL De-Verb или iZotope RX De-reverb. Они используют различные алгоритмы для различения прямого звука и отраженного (эхо/реверберация) и снижения последнего. 3. **Multiband Compression**: Многополосный компрессор позволяет управлять динамикой определенных частотных диапазонов, это может быть полезно для сокращения эхо, которое часто находится в определённом частотном диапазоне. 4. **Параметрический EQ (Эквалайзер)**: Вы можете использовать эквалайзер для уменьшения тех частот, на которых преимущественно проявляется эхо. Обычно это делается путем низкого \\"затухания\\", чтобы скрыть отдаленные, эхоподобные звуки. Важно отметить, что полностью удалить эхо с помощью VST плагинов может быть сложно, особенно если оно сильно проявляется в записи. Лучшие результаты часто достигаются при комбинировании нескольких методов и тщательном тюнинге настроек плагинов. Также, если эхо присутствует в реальном времени во время стрима или живой трансляции, его можно попытаться уменьшить с помощью VST плагинов, работающих в реальном времени, вместе с правильной акустической обработкой помещения и рациональным расположением микрофона."},{"prompt":"как убрать дыхание с микрофона динамического","completion":"Убрать шум дыхания в записи или во время живого выступления можно путем физической подготовки, использования техники и ряда методов постобработки аудио. Вот несколько советов, как минимизировать дыхание в микрофоне: 1. **Физическое положение микрофона:** - Разместите микрофон чуть выше или ниже уровня рта, а также под углом, чтобы дыхание пользователя направлялось не прямо в микрофон. - Используйте ветрозащиту или поп-фильтр, который поместится между ртом и микрофоном и уменьшит эффект дыхания. 2. **Техника дыхания:** - Работайте над своей техникой дыхания, чтобы обеспечить более тихий вдох и выдох. - Избегайте глубоких вздохов непосредственно перед микрофоном; лучше отвернитесь или отойдите. 3. **Настройка оборудования:** - Попробуйте снизить чувствительность микрофона (gain), чтобы он меньше улавливал тихие звуки, такие как дыхание. - Используйте динамический микрофон с направленной диаграммой направленности, например, кардиоидной, чтобы снизить улавливание звуков с боков и издали. 4. **Программная обработка (постобработка):** - Воспользуйтесь шумоподавляющими VST плагинами или встроенными функциями DAW для удаления или уменьшения нежелательных звуков дыхания в записи. - Используйте параметрический эквалайзер для вырезания частот, характерных звукам дыхания (обычно низкие частоты). - Примените динамические эффекты, такие как gate (шлюз) или expander, чтобы автоматически снижать уровень звука в тихих моментах, тем самым уменьшая дыхание. - Мануальный редактор аудиодорожек для точечного убавления или удаления отдельных звуков дыхания. 5. **Профилактические меры:** - Практикуйтесь в правильном использовании микрофона и разработайте привычку избегать глубокого и шумного дыхания во время выступлений или записи. - Постарайтесь сделать комнату, в которой вы записываетесь, более влажной (использование увлажнителя воздуха), чтобы избавиться от сухости и, как следствие, сделать дыхание более тихим. Помните, что полностью устранить звуки дыхания довольно сложно, особенно вживую, но их можно существенно уменьшить благодаря правильной технике, оборудованию и обработке."},{"prompt":"cómo puedo mejorar la gradacion de color de esta fotografía en LRC: https://imgur.com/PLSouG8","completion":"Para mejorar la gradación de color de una fotografía en Adobe Lightroom Classic (LRC), puedes seguir los siguientes pasos básicos orientados a ajustar los colores y el tono de la imagen: 1. **Ajuste de balance de blancos:** Primero, asegúrate de que el balance de blancos es correcto. Puedes utilizar la herramienta de balance de blancos para seleccionar un área neutral (gris o blanco) en la imagen o ajustarlo manualmente utilizando los controles deslizantes de 'Temperatura' y 'Tinte'. 2. **Exposición y contraste:** Ajusta la exposición para asegurarte de que la imagen tiene la luminosidad correcta. Modifica el contraste para que la imagen tenga más o menos diferencia entre luces y sombras. Usa también las herramientas de 'Luces', 'Sombras', 'Blancos' y 'Negros' para mejorar la gama tonal. 3. **HSL / Gradación de color:** Utiliza la sección de 'HSL/Color/Blanco y negro' para ajustar los tonos específicos dentro de la imagen. Con los controles deslizantes de 'Matiz', 'Saturación' y 'Luminancia' puedes cambiar el aspecto de los colores individuales, aumentar su intensidad o ajustar su brillo. 4. **División de tonos:** Puedes aplicar color a las sombras y a las luces de manera independiente. Esto puede ayudar a crear un aspecto más estilizado o a corregir tonalidades no deseadas. 5. **Curvas de tono:** La herramienta de curvas te permite hacer ajustes más precisos a las tonalidades en las sombras, medios tonos, y luces de la imagen. Puedes trabajar en el canal RGB completo o en canales individuales si quieres ajustar colores específicos. 6. **Ajustes locales:** Herramientas como el pincel de ajuste, el filtro graduado o el filtro radial te permiten hacer ajustes selectivos en la fotografía. Por ejemplo, puedes cambiar la saturación, exposición, o temperatura de color solo en áreas específicas. 7. **Detalle y nitidez:** Ajusta la nitidez de la imagen para realzar los detalles. Sé cauteloso con esto, ya que un exceso de nitidez puede introducir ruido en la imagen. 8. **Reducción de ruido:** Si tu fotografía tiene ruido (grano), puedes utilizar la reducción de ruido para suavizarlo. Ten en cuenta que la reducción de ruido también puede disminuir la nitidez si se usa en exceso. 9. **Efectos creativos:** La sección de 'Efectos' te permite añadir viñeteo o grano para un estilo más dramático o vintage si lo deseas. 10. **Calibración de cámara:** Por último, aunque no siempre es necesario, ajustar la calibración del perfil de color de la cámara puede influir en el aspecto general de los colores en tu imagen. Recuerda que es mejor hacer ajustes sutiles para evitar que la imagen se vea artificial. Es una buena práctica trabajar con el formato RAW para tener la mayor cantidad de información de color y luminancia posible, lo cual te permite hacer ajustes más precisos. Como cada imagen es única, no hay una receta universal que funcione igual en todas las fotografías. Por lo tanto, estos pasos deben tomarse como un punto de partida que debe ser personalizado según las necesidades de cada imagen y el gusto personal del fotógrafo."},{"prompt":"<a asp-area=\\"Admin\\" asp-action=\\"Delete\\" asp-route-id=\\"@item.RoleId\\">Delete</a> tôi nhấn không được có phải là do tôi cài đặt là app.UseHttpsRedirection(); app.UseStaticFiles(); app.UseRouting(); app.UseAuthentication(); app.UseAuthorization(); app.MapControllerRoute( name: \\"default\\", pattern: \\"{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}\\"); app.MapControllerRoute( name: \\"areasAdmin\\", pattern: \\"Admin/{controller=Home}/{action=Index}/{id?}\\", defaults: new { area = \\"Admin\\" }); app.MapControllerRoute( name: \\"areasAdminRoles\\", pattern: \\"Admin/{controller=Roles}/{action=Index}/{id?}\\", defaults: new { area = \\"Admin\\" });","completion":"Không thể nhấn vào liên kết \`<a asp-area=\\"Admin\\" asp-action=\\"Delete\\" asp-route-id=\\"@item.RoleId\\">Delete</a>\` để thực hiện hành động, có thể xuất phát từ nhiều nguyên nhân. Dưới đây là một số điều bạn nên xem xét: 1. **Middleware Order**: Thứ tự của các middleware là quan trọng. Ví dụ, \`app.UseStaticFiles()\` nên được đặt trước \`app.UseRouting()\` để đảm bảo các tài nguyên tĩnh được nhận biết trước khi routing xử lý. Tuy nhiên, thứ tự bạn cung cấp dường như là hợp lệ. 2. **Area Registration**: Khi bạn sử dụng Area trong ASP.NET Core, bạn cần đảm bảo rằng bạn đã đăng ký Area đúng cách trong các route. \`asp-area=\\"Admin\\"\` chỉ ra rằng bạn đang cố gắng truy cập một hành động trong Area \\"Admin\\", và bạn đã định nghĩa pattern cho area này trong \`Startup.cs\` của bạn, điều này là tốt. 3. **Action and Route Values**: Đảm bảo rằng controller trong Area \\"Admin\\" có một action tên là \`Delete\` và nó được thiết kế để nhận một tham số có tên là \`id\`. \`asp-route-id=\\"@item.RoleId\\"\` cho thấy bạn đang cố gắng truyền \`RoleId\` dưới dạng tham số của hành động. Hãy chắc chắn rằng tên tham số trong phương thức hành động của controller chính xác là \`id\`. 4. **Link Generation**: Tag Helper \`asp-\` trong ASP.NET Core sử dụng thông tin bạn cung cấp để tạo ra đường dẫn URL. Nếu có bất kỳ vấn đề nào với thông tin bạn cung cấp hoặc cấu hình routing, link có thể không được tạo ra thành công. Để kiểm tra điều này bạn có thể đặt breakpoint hoặc in đường dẫn đã tạo ra bằng cách sử dụng \`IUrlHelper\`. 5. **HTTPS Redirection**: Việc cài đặt \`app.UseHttpsRedirection();\` chuyển hướng các yêu cầu HTTP sang HTTPS, điều này là một phần thông thường của cấu hình an ninh web mà không gây ra vấn đề với việc tạo liên kết. 6. **Trạng thái Link**: Nếu link không \\"clickable\\", có thể là do CSS hoặc JavaScript trên trang đang ngăn chặn sự kiện click. Kiểm tra xem có đoạn mã JavaScript nào đè lên sự kiện click của nút không, hoặc nếu CSS đang làm cho liên kết không thể tương tác. Nếu sau khi xem xét các điểm trên mà link vẫn không hoạt động, có thể bạn cần gỡ lỗi bằng cách sử dụng công cụ phát triển trên trình duyệt để xem trạng thái cuối cùng của link, hoặc kiểm tra xem có thông điệp lỗi nào được ghi lại trong console không."},{"prompt":"builder.Services.AddMvc() .AddRazorPagesOptions(options => options.AllowAreas = true); dùng cái này được không","completion":"Dòng code bạn đưa ra: \`\`\`csharp builder.Services.AddMvc() .AddRazorPagesOptions(options => options.AllowAreas = true); \`\`\` Trong ASP.NET Core, \`AddRazorPagesOptions\` được sử dụng để cấu hình các tùy chọn cho Razor Pages.

Điều này sẽ kích hoạt hỗ trợ Areas trong các Razor Pages của bạn. Tuy nhiên, nếu bạn đang sử dụng MVC Controllers và Views (không phải Razor Pages) và bạn muốn tạo liên kết đến các hành động trong Controller thì đoạn code trên không liên quan đến vấn đề mà bạn đang gặp phải. Thông thường, \`AddMvc\` không cần được cấu hình trong trường hợp này vì hỗ trợ các Areas trong MVC Controller và Views được bật mặc định.

Tuy nhiên, dưới đây là một số điều cần lưu ý trong đoạn mã của bạn và những điều cần kiểm tra nếu ứng dụng của bạn bị dừng lại: 1. **Kiểm tra log**: Khi ứng dụng bị dừng đột ngột, hãy xem xét các bản ghi log để tìm thông điệp lỗi hoặc sự cố. ASP.NET Core mặc định sẽ ghi log thông tin này, và bạn có thể xem trong Output window nếu bạn đang sử dụng Visual Studio hoặc trong cửa sổ terminal nếu bạn đang chạy ứng dụng từ dòng lệnh. 2. **Exception Handling**: Đảm bảo bạn có xử lý ngoại lệ (exception handling) đúng cách. Nhìn chung, khi điều gì đó không đúng trong việc xử lý dữ liệu, ngoại lệ nên được bắt và xử lý hợp lý thay vì khiến ứng dụng bị crash. 3. **Validation**: Kiểm tra xem bạn đã xác thực dữ liệu đầu vào một cách đúng đắn không. Mầm ModelState.IsValid sẽ kiểm tra xác thực dựa trên các Data Annotations được đặt trong model của bạn. 4. **Database Connectivity**: Kiểm tra xem có vấn đề nào với kết nối cơ sở dữ liệu không, ví dụ như string kết nối không đúng, server cơ sở dữ liệu không hoạt động, hoặc quyền truy cập bị giới hạn. 5. **File Upload Handling**: Các phương thức \`Utilities.UploadFile\` bạn sử dụng để xử lý tải file lên có thể đang phát sinh ngoại lệ không được xử lý. Đảm bảo bạn có exception handling đúng cách cho các tình huống có thể xảy ra như lỗi quyền truy cập tệp tin, đường dẫn không tồn tại, v.v. 6. **Server Resources**: Đôi khi máy chủ có thể không có đủ nguồn tài nguyên (như bộ nhớ) để xử lý yêu cầu, dẫn đến việc bị dừng đột ngột. Kiểm tra xem máy chủ có đủ tài nguyên không, và nếu có, hãy cố gắng làm sạch và giải phóng tài nguyên sau mỗi yêu cầu. 7. **Debugging**: Sử dụng debugger để bước qua mã của bạn và xác định chính xác dòng mã nào khiến ứng dụng bị dừng. Đây là một công cụ mạnh mẽ giúp bạn xác định vấn đề cụ thể trong mã nguồn của mình. Nếu sau tất cả các kiểm tra này và việc gỡ lỗi không tìm thấy nguyên nhân, có khả năng vấn đề nằm ở cấp độ hệ thống mà không phải là mã nguồn của bạn. Trong trường hợp đó, hãy kiểm tra cấu hình môi trường, quản trị hệ thống, hoặc cần thiết, liên hệ với nhóm hỗ trợ của nền tảng phát triển hoặc cơ sở dữ liệu bạn đang sử dụng."},{"prompt":"sao tôi không thấy Kiểm tra log: Khi ứng dụng bị dừng đột ngột, hãy xem xét các bản ghi log để tìm thông điệp lỗi hoặc sự cố. ASP.NET Core mặc định sẽ ghi log thông tin này, và bạn có thể xem trong Output window nếu bạn đang sử dụng Visual Studio hoặc trong cửa sổ terminal nếu bạn đang chạy ứng dụng từ dòng lệnh.","completion":"Nếu bạn không thể tìm thấy hoặc không thấy log khi ứng dụng của bạn bị dừng đột ngột, có thể có một số nguyên nhân: 1. **Cấu hình Logging**: Kiểm tra lại file cấu hình của ứng dụng (như \`appsettings.json\`) để đảm bảo logging được cấu hình để ghi ra mức độ chi tiết bạn cần. Trong ASP.NET Core, bạn có thể cấu hình các cấp độ log khác nhau như Trace, Debug, Information, Warning, Error, và Critical. 2. **Console và Debug Output**: Đảm bảo bạn đang xem ở phần đúng của Output trong Visual Studio hoặc IDE mà bạn sử dụng. Trong Visual Studio, bạn cần chọn \\"Show output from\\" và chọn \\"Debug\\" trong dropdown menu của cửa sổ Output để xem các thông điệp log trong quá trình debug. 3. **Mở Terminal hoặc Command Prompt**: Nếu bạn đang chạy ứng dụng thông qua dòng lệnh (ví dụ bằng \`dotnet run\`), các bản ghi log (logs) phải xuất hiện trực tiếp trong cửa sổ terminal mà bạn đang sử dụng. 4. **Provider Logging**: ASP.NET Core hỗ trợ nhiều loại provider logging khác nhau (Console, Debug, EventSource, EventLog, TraceSource, v.v.). Đảm bảo bạn đã cấu hình ít nhất một provider để ghi các bản ghi log. 5. **Global Exception Handler**: Nếu ứng dụng của bạn thiết kế để bắt tất cả các exception và không ghi log chúng hoặc chuyển chúng đến một trình xử lý toàn cầu, hãy kiểm tra xử lý ngoại lệ toàn cấp để xem sự cố đang được xử lý như thế nào. 6. **IIS Logging**: Nếu ứng dụng đang chạy trên IIS (Internet Information Services), bạn có thể kiểm tra log của IIS để xem liệu có thông tin bổ sung về sự cố hay không. 7. **Ứng dụng Crash**: Trong một số trường hợp, nếu ứng dụng bị crash nhanh chóng hoặc sự cố xảy ra ở mức độ hệ thống, log có thể không kịp được ghi. Trong trường hợp này, bạn có thể kiểm tra Event Viewer của Windows để tìm thông tin liên quan đến các sự cố ứng dụng hoặc hệ thống. Để đảm bảo logging được thiết lập đúng cách, bạn có thể thêm mã sau vào file \`Startup.cs\` (đoạn mã này thêm logging console trong môi trường phát triển): \`\`\`csharp public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app, IWebHostEnvironment env, ILogger<Startup> logger) { if (env.IsDevelopment()) { app.UseDeveloperExceptionPage(); } else { // Add error handling middleware, etc. } // Existing configuration... // Example logging logger.LogInformation(\\"The application has started.\\"); } \`\`\` Nếu bạn đã làm tất cả những điều trên mà vẫn không thấy log, bạn có thể cần xem xét lại việc cấu hình ứng dụng hoặc kiểm tra lại xem có điều gì chưa đúng trong cách bạn đang tìm kiếm log không."},{"prompt":"'YTe.exe' (CoreCLR: DefaultDomain): Loaded 'C:Program FilesdotnetsharedMicrosoft.NETCore.App7.0.11System.Private.CoreLib.dll'.

However, the application then exits with a special exit code \`0xffffffff\`, which is \`-1\` represented as an unsigned integer and typically signifies an error. Here are a few points to consider based on the log provided: # Immediate Observations 1. **Application Start and Database Query Execution**: The application started, and it executed a SQL query successfully. Therefore, the crash does not seem to be caused by an initial setup or connectivity issue. 2. **Normal Thread Exit**: Several threads exit with code \`0\`, which is normal as threads complete their work. 3. **Application Exit Code**: The application exits with code \`4294967295\` (hex \`0xffffffff\`), which implies an error occurred. This is not a standard exit code and usually means the application encountered an unhandled exception or other critical failure that caused it to terminate. # Investigative Actions To discover the cause of this abnormal termination, consider the following steps: 1. **Exception Handling**: Ensure global exception handling mechanisms are in place. For web applications in ASP.NET Core, exception filters or middleware such as \`UseDeveloperExceptionPage\` in development and \`UseExceptionHandler\` in production should be used. 2. **Debugging**: Use Just-In-Time debugging (if you're not already doing so) to catch the exception as it's thrown. Visual Studio and other debuggers can be configured to break when an exception is thrown. 3. **Application Events**: Check for application shutdown events. You can override the \`OnShutdown\` method or handle the \`ApplicationStopping\` and \`ApplicationStopped\` events from \`IApplicationLifetime\` to see if any code is being executed that may cause the application to exit. 4. **Event Viewer**: The Windows Event Viewer may have logs related to the application crash. Check the \\"Application\\" logs for any relevant errors or warnings. 5. **Logging Verbosity**: Increase the verbosity level of the logging to capture more detailed information. Set your logging to the \`Debug\` level, or even \`Trace\`, in the \`appsettings.json\` or \`appsettings.Development.json\` configuration file. 6. **Unmanaged Resources**: If your application uses unmanaged resources, ensure they are being handled correctly, as mishandling them can cause errors that result in abrupt terminations. 7. **External Components**: If your application calls out to external components, libraries, or services, ensure those are operating correctly and are not the sources of the failure. 8. **ASP.NET Core Version**: The log mentions .NET 7, ensure your system meets all the requirements and that all dependencies are compatible with this version.

Dưới đây là một số bước bạn có thể thực hiện để tìm ra nguyên nhân gây ra sự cố và xử lý nó: 1. **Xử lý Ngoại lệ Toàn cục**: Kiểm tra xem ứng dụng của bạn có đang sử dụng cơ chế xử lý ngoại lệ toàn cục hay không, như sử dụng \`UseDeveloperExceptionPage\` khi ở môi trường phát triển và \`UseExceptionHandler\` khi ở môi trường sản xuất. 2. **Gỡ lỗi**: Sử dụng gỡ lỗi tức thì (Just-In-Time debugging) để nắm bắt ngoại lệ khi nó xảy ra. Visual Studio và các trình gỡ lỗi khác có thể được cấu hình để dừng lại khi một ngoại lệ được ném ra. 3. **Sự kiện Ứng dụng**: Kiểm tra sự kiện shutdown của ứng dụng. Bạn có thể ghi đè phương thức \`OnShutdown\` hoặc xử lý sự kiện \`ApplicationStopping\` và \`ApplicationStopped\` từ \`IApplicationLifetime\` để xem có code nào đang được thực thi khiến ứng dụng thoát không. 4. **Event Viewer**: Event Viewer của Windows có thể có log liên quan đến việc ứng dụng dừng đột ngột. Kiểm tra phần \\"Application\\" trong logs để xem có lỗi hoặc cảnh báo nào phù hợp không. 5. **Tăng Độ Chi Tiết của Log**: Tăng mức độ chi tiết của log để thu thập thông tin chi tiết hơn. Bạn có thể thiết lập log ở mức độ \`Debug\` hoặc thậm chí là \`Trace\` trong file cấu hình \`appsettings.json\` hoặc \`appsettings.Development.json\`. 6. **Tài nguyên không được quản lý**: Nếu ứng dụng của bạn sử dụng tài nguyên không quản lý, hãy đảm bảo rằng chúng đang được xử lý đúng cách, vì những sai sót có thể gây ra lỗi gây thoát ứng dụng đột ngột. 7. **Thành phần Ngoại vi**: Nếu ứng dụng của bạn gọi đến các thành phần, thư viện hoặc dịch vụ bên ngoài, hãy đảm bảo rằng những cái này hoạt động đúng đắn và không phải là nguyên nhân của sự cố. 8. **Phiên bản ASP.NET Core**: Log nhắc đến .NET 7, hãy chắc chắn rằng hệ thống của bạn đáp ứng tất cả yêu cầu và rằng tất cả các phụ thuộc đều tương thích với phiên bản này. Bạn nên sử dụng những thông tin trên để đi sâu hơn vào việc điều tra nguyên nhân của việc thoát khỏi ứng dụng bất thường này.

Nếu không có quyền, đoạn code này có thể gây ra ngoại lệ không được bắt và khiến cho ứng dụng dừng. 2. **Kiểm Tra Định Dạng File**: Code hiện tại chỉ cho phép các định dạng \\"jpg\\", \\"jpeg\\", \\"png\\", \\"gif\\". Nếu file không thuộc một trong những định dạng này, nó sẽ trả về \`null\`. Đảm bảo rằng người dùng đang cố gắng tải lên đúng định dạng file. 3. **Kích Thước File và Bộ Nhớ**: Kiểm tra xem kích thước của file tải lên có quá lớn không và liệu có gây quá tải cho bộ nhớ máy chủ không. Điều này có thể gây ra OutOfMemoryException hoặc những vấn đề liên quan đến bộ nhớ. 4. **Exception Handling**: Code của bạn bắt và trả về \`null\` khi có ngoại lệ. Bạn có thể muốn log ngoại lệ để có cái nhìn rõ ràng hơn về vấn đề. Thay vì chỉ trả về \`null\`, hãy sử dụng logging để ghi lại thông tin của ngoại lệ: \`\`\`csharp catch (Exception ex) { // Log the exception message or more details Console.WriteLine(ex.ToString()); // Example: use a proper logging mechanism instead return null; } \`\`\` 5. **Kiểm Tra Trạng Thái Ứng Dụng**: Dùng debugger để kiểm tra điểm dừng chính xác của ứng dụng và xác định xem câu lệnh nào trong method UploadFile đang gây ra vấn đề. 6. **Kiểm Tra Resources**: Nếu ứng dụng crash chỉ khi tải file lên, cần kiểm tra xem việc này khiến cho máy chủ không phải đang cạn kiệt tài nguyên như CPU hoặc bộ nhớ không.

Within the American literary culture, the people have undergone a meticulous examination, more so than that of the empire itself. It can be contended that this phenomenon is an organic manifestation of the individualism inextricably linked with the very concept of America. Walt Whitman has proven one of the most influential figures in American poetry, and his position in literature is deeply intertwined with this ideal. In fact, to Whitman we can ascribe the mantle of progenitor of the American literary conversation, and crucial figure in shaping it from the onset. Whitman’s importance to America cannot be overstated. Roy Harvey Pearce posits that “all American poetry… is, in essence… a series of arguments with Whitman” (qtd. in MacPhail 135). None of his work serves as a more eminent example of this fact than “I Hear America Singing.” The nature of this poem, and Whitman’s choices in expressing the nature and spirit of the American people spurred response from others decades past his time. These poets, namely Langston Hughes and Allen Ginsberg, approach Whitman’s words in “I Hear,” through the lenses of their personal convictions and periods. By examining these responses to Whitman situated within their personal movements, the distinct differences within the Americas that each experienced become all too clear. To understand the argument that is taken with Whitman, it is of utmost importance to understand that which he said. Whitman’s language in “I Hear” could be construed as rather heavy-handed. He claims the ability to hear the voices of American in song. In doing so he positions himself to speak on behalf of America. And the manner in which he does so belies his perspective on the American voice. And by extension, the soul. There are several aspects to understanding the symbolism in Whitman’s prose. But most important of these is song, which serves to frame all that is conveyed by the poem. Whitman uses song to draw reference to the sense of pride in one’s work that has come to be all too familiar to the American psyche. The act of singing becomes the act of self-expression, the choice to exclaim your individuality. Whitman furthers this idea by ascribing to each group mentioned a unique song, one that purportedly expresses “what belongs to him or her and to none else” (Whitman). This draws attention to the different ways in which people engage with America, and the diverse perspectives that entail. This diversity, to Whitman, is a crucial facet of the American condition, and","completion":"This passage exhibits several characteristics of an academic and analytical writing style: 1.

From a stylistic perspective, here are some specific aspects of the passage's writing style: 1. **Lexical Density and Diction**: The passage employs a dense and carefully chosen lexicon. The choice of words is precise and often formal (\\"organic manifestation,\\" \\"meticulous examination\\"), which lends an academic and intellectual feel to the writing. 2. **Syntactic Complexity**: The sentences are often complex and compound-complex in structure, with multiple clauses and phrases (\\"And the manner in which he does so belies his perspective on the American voice.\\"). This complexity reflects a sophisticated approach to sentence construction and helps to convey nuanced ideas. 3. **Passive Construction**: There's occasional usage of the passive voice (\\"it can be contended,\\" \\"is deeply intertwined\\"), which is common in academic writing as it places the focus on the subject or idea rather than the actor. 4. **Juxtaposition and Contrast**: The passage utilizes contrasts between authors and time periods to draw attention to differing perspectives and interpretations, often juxtaposing these ideas directly for effect (\\"These poets, namely Langston Hughes and Allen Ginsberg, approach Whitman's words in 'I Hear,' through the lenses of their personal convictions and periods.\\"). 5. **Analytic Narration**: The writing isn't just informational; it also crafts a narrative around the analysis, leading the reader through the history and influence of American poetry from Whitman to subsequent poets like Hughes and Ginsberg. 6. **Modality**: The author employs modal verbs and phrases that express contention, possibility, and opinion (\\"It can be contended,\\" \\"could be construed\\"), which suggest a degree of academic caution or allowance for alternative interpretations. 7. **Intertextuality**: There is direct engagement with texts both referenced and quoted, showing a dialogue with existing literature and critical analyses. The use of intertextuality places the passage within a broader literary conversation. 8. **Metadiscourse**: The passage employs a reflective, metadiscursive style, commenting on the act of literary analysis itself (\\"To understand the argument that is taken with Whitman, it is of utmost importance to understand that which he said.\\"). 9. **Rhetorical Devices**: Though nuanced, rhetorical devices are used, such as parallelism (\\"He claims the ability to hear the voices of American in song.\\"). It serves to emphasize the points being made and to make the writing more compelling. 10. **Transition and Flow**: The use of transitional phrases and connectors (\\"In fact,\\" \\"By examining\\") ensures the argument progresses logically and smoothly, guiding the reader through the complex analysis without abrupt shifts in topic. 11. **Referencing**: The writer uses in-text referencing, adhering to scholarly convention and providing source material for claims made (\\"Roy Harvey Pearce posits... (qtd. in MacPhail 135)\\"). 12. **Hallmarks of Persuasion**: While maintaining objectivity, the passage subtly persuades by presenting the material with confidence and by framing Whitman's contribution as foundational and widely contested (\\"Whitman's importance to America cannot be overstated.\\"). The style aligns with what one might find in literary criticism or a scholarly article, where the interplay between high-level vocabulary, complex sentence structures, and the shaping of a compelling, argumentative narrative is key to effectively communicating one's analysis."},{"prompt":"emulating the style in the passage above, can you write an essay following the outline here: Thesis: I will achieve my American dream by finding a career as a software engineer. 1.

For myself, this quintessential dream is encapsulated by the pursuit of a vocation in software engineering—an ambition grounded in the confluence of innovation and pragmatic forward-thinking. It is my contention that the realization of this dream coalesces around a strategic pathway: commencing with the procurement of a bachelor's degree in Computer Science, followed by a calculated progression through internships, networking, and personal development leading up to a meticulous job search. The present treatise will delineate this trajectory, underscoring the pivotal junctions and decisions that will inexorably guide me towards the epitome of my American dream. The genesis of this endeavor resides in matriculation from Mercer County Community College (MCCC) and subsequent completion of a bachelor's degree. The forthcoming task entails a diligent survey of potential universities to which I might transfer. Within the ambit of New Jersey state-sponsored programs, a preordained transfer from MCCC to exemplary institutions such as Rutgers presents itself as the more risk-averse alternative, significantly abating the associated pecuniary burden. Concurrently, the allure of exploring establishments beyond state confines beckons, necessitating an incisive appraisal of their distinctive offerings—both academically and culturally. Universities of notable repute, such as UChicago, command careful consideration, especially in terms of entrance procedures and financial exigencies. In alignment with resource allocation, the application for assistance via governmental aid programs and scholarships is an absolute imperative. Concurrent with these undertakings is the imperative to augment my capabilities. The acquisition of internships stands as a vital cornerstone of practical education, with institutions like Jane Street offering fortuitous arenas for both skill enhancement and the weaving of professional tapestries. This platform not only facilitates the development of proficiencies across diverse sectors, such as fintech versus cloud computing but also builds a robust repository of prospects for the future. Complementing the formal curriculum, participation in industry conferences and lectures emerges as an indispensable facet of keeping abreast with imminent technological advancements. Moreover, the execution of personal projects will bolster my resume, indelibly marking my aptitude for engaging in authentic work environments. Endeavors such as contributing to open-source projects and the iterative preparation for technical interviews prior to actual application processes are indicative of a proactive strategy. As the pursuit transitions into the realm of interviewing and job hunting, an acute awareness of the market's pulse—garnered from anecdotal evidence and statistical insight—becomes crucial. Should the hiring atmosphere exhibit signs of stagnation, my criteria for potential roles may unavoidably require temperance. Conversely, a buoyant employment climate permits a more discerning approach, particularly in relation to geographical preferences. The Pacific Northwest, characterized by cities such as Seattle, offers an appealing juxtaposition of affordability and technological dynamism. Firms such as Lyft tout commendable work-life balance, with a predilection for remote positions—a testament to their adaptability in contemporary work paradigms. As alternatives unfold, regions like Northern Virginia and the Bay Area beckon with their unique climates and cultures. Proximity to the nation's capital often necessitates security clearances, an element that circumscribes job fluidity yet presents a stratum of exclusivity and security. Contrarily, the Bay Area's exorbitant living expenses posit an onerous challenge, demanding substantive financial strategizing for residency. In summation, the attainment of my American dream as a software engineer is an intricate tapestry woven with threads of academic rigor, professional development, and nuanced life choices. It is a journey punctuated by vigilance, adaptability, and unwavering resolve, with each decision meticulously aligned with the ultimate goal—a testament to the enduring ethos of individualism and opportunity that defines the American spirit."},{"prompt":"EXPLAIN ME THIS CODE PLEASE: const char delim=','; int main(int argc, char * argv[]){ // random number generator // deterministic seed to ensure reproducibility // once pipeline is completed auto random = create_random(42); // used for reporting purposes int num_processed = 0; int num_passed = 0; int num_surprising = 0; // avg depth across the genome // used to trim trajectories with // apparent deletions std::vector<double> avg_depths; // iterate over all trajectory records in file std::string line; while(std::getline(std::cin,line)){ // parse trajectory record std::stringstream line_stream(line); std::string item; std::string subitem; std::string allele; std::vector<double> times; std::vector<double> alts; std::vector<double> depths; // these entries not needed for this step in pipeline std::getline(line_stream, item, ','); // chromosome std::getline(line_stream, item, ','); // location std::getline(line_stream, allele, ','); // allele // times std::getline(line_stream, item, ','); std::stringstream item_stream0(item); while(std::getline(item_stream0, subitem, ' ')){ if(subitem.size() > 0){ times.push_back(std::stof(subitem)); } } // alts std::getline(line_stream, item, ','); std::stringstream item_stream(item); while(std::getline(item_stream, subitem, ' ')){ if(subitem.size() > 0){ alts.push_back(std::stof(subitem)); } } // depths std::getline(line_stream, item, ','); std::stringstream item_stream2(item); while(std::getline(item_stream2, subitem, ' ')){ if(subitem.size() > 0){ depths.push_back(std::stof(subitem)); } }","completion":"This code snippet is part of a C++ program that appears to process genetic trajectory data. It's incomplete, but I can explain the provided part. Here's an overview of what it does: 1. Define a \`const char delim\` which is set to \`','\`. This character represents the delimiter used in parsing data, presumably from a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file. 2. The \`main\` function: - Initializes a random number generator with a deterministic seed (42) to ensure reproducibility in whatever operations follow that require randomness. - Three integer variables \`num_processed\`, \`num_passed\`, and \`num_surprising\` are initialized to zero. These are meant for tracking statistics: how many records have been processed, how many have passed certain criteria, and how many have been surprising or unexpected in some way. - A \`std::vector<double>\` named \`avg_depths\` is declared. This vector will store the average depth across the genome, which is a measure often used in genomics to assess the number of times a particular region of the genome has been sequenced. 3. The main loop of the program then starts, which continues as long as there are lines to read from standard input (\`std::cin\`). Each line is expected to contain trajectory records with specific fields. 4. Within the loop: - A \`std::string\` variable named \`line\` is declared, and each line of the input is read into this variable. - A \`std::stringstream\` object for the line, \`line_stream\`, is created to parse the line by delimiters. - Several temporary variables are declared for parsing the line, including \`item\`, \`subitem\`, \`allele\`, \`times\`, \`alts\`, and \`depths\`. The \`allele\` is a string, while the \`times\`, \`alts\`, and \`depths\` are vectors of \`double\` expected to store numerical values. 5. The parsing process consists of using \`std::getline\` to read parts of the line separated by commas and spaces: - Chromosome and location are read into \`item\` but not used, as indicated by the comment. - The allele is read and stored into the \`allele\` variable. - Times, alts, and depths are parsed from the line by reading substrings separated by spaces (\`' '\`) within the substring delimited by commas (\`','\`). Each numerical value is converted from a string to a \`float\` using \`std::stof\` and pushed back into the corresponding vector (\`times\`, \`alts\`, or \`depths\`). 6. The code snippet ends abruptly, suggesting there is more to the program not provided here. The subsequent code would likely involve doing something with the parsed data (i.e., processing the trajectory data and possibly updating the \`num_processed\`, \`num_passed\`, and \`num_surprising\` counters, or storing/analyzing the \`avg_depths\`). 7. The \`create_random\` function mentioned is not shown, so I assume it's a function defined elsewhere in the program or in a linked library that generates a pseudo-random number generator object, seeded with the given integer (\`42\` in this case). Finally, please note that the \`std::stof\` function can throw exceptions if the string it tries to convert to a float doesn't contain a valid number, which is not handled in the code snippet provided. Additionally, the code is not exception-safe or robust against malformed input, which you'd typically want in production code."},{"prompt":"this code reads from stdin, is it possible to make defined arguments? also, how can I print each line read?","completion":"Yes, the code provided reads from \`std::cin\` which corresponds to standard input. If you want to read from a file provided as a command-line argument instead, you can open a file stream with the given filename. To print out each line read, you can simply add a \`std::cout\` statement inside the while loop after reading each line. Here is how you could modify the \`main\` function to read from a file provided as a command-line argument and print each line: \`\`\`cpp #include <fstream> #include <iostream> #include <sstream> #include <vector> #include <string> // ... Other code ... int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { // ... Other code ... std::istream* pinput = &std::cin; // Pointer to input stream std::ifstream infile; // Input file stream for reading from a file // Check if a filename was provided as a command-line argument. if (argc > 1) { infile.open(argv[1]); if (!infile) { std::cerr << \\"Error opening file: \\" << argv[1] << std::endl; return 1; } pinput = &infile; } // Now, use pinput as the source for reading instead of std::cin std::string line; while (std::getline(*pinput, line)) { // Note: Add the printing line here to print each line read std::cout << line << std::endl; // ... Existing code for parsing the line ... } // Close the file if it was opened if (infile.is_open()) { infile.close(); } // ... Rest of your code ... return 0; // Make sure to return an exit code } \`\`\` With this modification, if the program is run without command-line arguments, it will read from \`std::cin\` as before, i.e., it can read from the terminal or can be used with pipeline redirection. If a filename is provided as the first argument, it will try to open that file and read from it instead. When running the program, you can provide a filename like so: \`\`\`sh ./myprogram data.csv \`\`\` This assumes your program's executable name is \`myprogram\` and the file you want to read from is \`data.csv\`. Keep in mind that proper error checking and file handling are good practices, so you should handle cases where the file cannot be opened or does not exist. The code above includes a basic check for this. Additionally, if you expect more command-line arguments, you will need to adjust the \`if (argc > 1)\` check accordingly."},{"prompt":"what is happening here?: const char delim=','; int main(int argc, char * argv[]){ // random number generator // deterministic seed to ensure reproducibility // once pipeline is completed auto random = create_random(42); // used for reporting purposes int num_processed = 0; int num_passed = 0; int num_surprising = 0; // avg depth across the genome // used to trim trajectories with // apparent deletions std::vector<double> avg_depths; return 0; }","completion":"This code fragment is an excerpt from a larger C++ program that demonstrates several concepts. Let's break down each part: \`\`\`cpp const char delim=','; \`\`\` - This line defines a constant character \`delim\` set to the comma character \`','\`. This will be used as a delimiter, likely in parsing strings such as CSV input, but it is not used directly in the provided code snippet. \`\`\`cpp int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { \`\`\` - This is the entry point for any C++ program. The parameters \`argc\` and \`argv[]\` represent the command-line argument count and array, respectively. \`argc\` is an integer that indicates how many arguments were passed to the program (including the program name itself), and \`argv\` is an array of C-style strings (character arrays) that hold each argument. \`\`\`cpp auto random = create_random(42); \`\`\` - This line suggests the code is creating a random number generator initialized with \`42\` as a seed to ensure reproducible results. The specific implementation of \`create_random\` is not provided, so it's not clear what exactly \`random\` will be, but we can infer it's an object or function pointer used for generating random numbers. Using a fixed seed is useful when you want the random number sequence to be the same every time the program is run, which is important for debugging or when results need to be reproducible. \`\`\`cpp int num_processed = 0; int num_passed = 0; int num_surprising = 0; \`\`\` - These three lines declare and initialize three integer variables to zero. They are likely intended to be used as counters for tracking the number of items that have been processed, the number of items that have met some passing criteria, and the number of items that are considered surprising during the processing of the program's input. \`\`\`cpp std::vector<double> avg_depths; \`\`\` - This line declares a vector (dynamic array) of doubles that will store average depths. In the context of genomics, \\"depth\\" often refers to the number of times a particular position in a DNA sequence is read during sequencing. The \`avg_depths\` vector seems intended to store average depth values across the genome to identify and possibly exclude trajectories with apparent deletions. \`\`\`cpp return 0; } \`\`\` - Finally, \`return 0;\` is the exit status of the program, where \`0\` traditionally signifies that the program completed successfully. The \`}\` marks the end of the \`main\` function and essentially the end of any code execution for this program. This given code does not perform any input/output operations itself, and the variables and the \`random\` object are not used within the shown snippet. To provide meaningful functionality, the remainder of the code that utilizes these variables and the \`random\` object is necessary."},{"prompt":"so until now, that code does not need any input file, right?","completion":"Correct, the code snippet you provided does not require any input file as it stands. It doesn't contain any file reading operations or any use of standard input (\`std::cin\`). The variables and the random number generator are initialized, but the code does not perform any actions with them before it ends. To actually make use of the constants, variables, and \`random\` object, additional code that processes input (be it from a file, standard input, or other data sources) would be needed. If you want the program to work with an input file, you would have to add code to open and read from a file stream (or standard input), parse the received data, and then use the variables accordingly.

It reads this data line-by-line, parsing it into different components, and stores numerical data in vectors. It has sections marked for additional statistics calculations, though the actual calculations are not implemented in the code provided. Here's a breakdown of the operations performed by this code: 1. Reads lines from standard input in a loop. 2. Parses each line into separate values using comma \`,\` as the delimiter. 3. Extracts and discards the chromosome and location information. 4. Extracts allele information. 5. Extracts and converts times, alts, and depths numerical data from a string to floating-point numbers and stores them in vectors. 6. Prepares variables (flags and indexes) for further statistical analysis, presumably to check for genomic variations such as deletions or duplications and the quality of the trajectory. The code reads input until there is no more data. However, there are no operations after the data is parsed, and the statistical variables declared are not used. Also, the defined integers at the beginning (\`num_processed\`, \`num_passed\`, \`num_surprising\`) are intended for tracking purposes but aren't utilized within the loop. To print the variables for debug purposes, you could use \`std::cout\` statements. Here's how to print the variables after they've been set within the loop: \`\`\`cpp // Inside the while loop, after the parsing of lines std::cout << \\"Line processed: \\" << line << std::endl; std::cout << \\"Allele: \\" << allele << std::endl; std::cout << \\"Times: \\"; for (const auto& t : times) std::cout << t << \\" \\"; std::cout << std::endl; std::cout << \\"Alts: \\"; for (const auto& a : alts) std::cout << a << \\" \\"; std::cout << std::endl; std::cout << \\"Depths: \\"; for (const auto& d : depths) std::cout << d << \\" \\"; std::cout << std::endl; // You would do the same for any other variables you would like to debug // For example, after the statistical calculations: // std::cout << \\"Passed filter: \\" << passed_filter << std::endl; // ... and so forth for other variables \`\`\` The \`std::cout\` statements will print a human-readable form of the variables to the console.

Here's a checklist of what to verify: 1. Ensure that \`snp.txt\` has the correct data and is in the same directory as the \`a.out\` when you run the command, or specify the correct path. 2. Confirm that the program has been compiled correctly without any errors and that the resulting \`a.out\` is up-to-date. If uncertain, recompile the program using \`g++ main.cpp\` and then run it again. 3. The \`std::cout << line << std::endl;\` statement should indeed print each line it reads from \`std::cin\`. If the file is large or the printing is buffered, there might be a bit of delay before you see the output on your screen. Try flushing the output explicitly with \`std::cout.flush()\` after the print statement. 4. If the file is empty or the data is formatted incorrectly and causes \`std::getline(std::cin,line)\` to fail, nothing will be printed. Check the content of \`snp.txt\` for any potential issues. 5. Make sure your standard input redirection is functioning properly. If you're on a Unix-like system (Linux, macOS), the command you're using should work fine. If the \`cat\` command or the pipe \`|\` is not working correctly, it could prevent the standard input from being provided to your program. 6. If your system buffers the output to the terminal and you forcefully interrupt the program before it exits normally, you may not see any buffered output. Allow the program to complete and return naturally to ensure the buffered output is flushed. For debugging purposes, let's try to modify your code a bit to add more diagnostics: \`\`\`cpp #include <iostream> #include <sstream> #include <vector> #include <string> int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { // ... Other variables ... std::string line; int linesRead = 0; // Counter to know how many lines have been read while(std::getline(std::cin, line)){ linesRead++; std::cout << \\"Line \\" << linesRead << \\": \\" << line << std::endl; // ...

Ruth and Aimee are barefoot on the sofa. They do not mention hypnosis or psychology. Through a covert hypnosis script, Ruth easily hypnotizes David into a deep trance using casual conversational techniques, with no awakening scene.","completion":"[INT. DAVID'S LIVING ROOM - EVENING] David lounges comfortably on one end of the sofa, absorbed in the glow of the television. Ruth and Aimee are nestled on the other end, their bare feet tucked beneath them. The room is cozy and filled with the sound of a quirky British sitcom. Snacks are strewn across the coffee table. AIMEE (laughing) This show is ridiculous. Why do the characters always end up in these bizarre situations? RUTH (smiling) It's the charm of British comedy. It's always about the quirky twists. Life's a bit like that, wouldn't you say, David? DAVID (reclining, arms behind head) Life's only weird if you don't pay attention to the details. RUTH (glancing at Aimee, then back to David) But sometimes it’s the details that make you lose focus on the bigger picture. Like you can concentrate really hard on one detail and everything else just... fades away. AIMEE (nodding) Yeah, like when you're reading a good book and the world around you disappears. Have you felt that, David? DAVID Yeah, got lost in a book or two. Why? RUTH (raising an eyebrow) Because it's amazing how powerful our minds are. Just by focusing on something, like a character or a line, we can completely immerse ourselves. DAVID (slightly more engaged) True. Like when you zone out staring at something, like the TV, and you just sort of drift... RUTH (softly, a gentle cadence to her voice) Exactly, drifting. Like how you might focus on the flickering images on the screen, how they can start to look like they're moving slower or faster, just flowing, almost like they’re dancing just for you. DAVID His eyes tick towards the television, his body relaxing further. DAVID (quieter) Mmm. Sort of hypnotic, isn't it? RUTH (head tilted, a small smile) Very hypnotic. The flickering light, it's kind of like... when you’re watching the flames of a fire, and you don’t realize how deeply you’re sinking into your own mind. AIMEE Fires are so calming. It's why people get lost in their warmth and the soft sound of crackling wood. It's all just so comfortable. DAVID (eyes fixed on the screen, his voice a murmur) Comfortable. Warm. Nice. RUTH And as you get more comfortable, you might feel your eyelids getting a little heavy. Each blink longer than the last. DAVID (blinks slowly, sighs softly) Yeah. RUTH But it’s such an effort to keep those eyes open, to fight that lovely feeling of just letting go, isn’t it, David? So much easier to let those eyes rest for a moment, to let that feeling take over. DAVID (staring blankly at the TV, his eyes finally closing) Mmm. Easier. RUTH (voice gentle and rhythmic) That's right. Easier. And with each word, you’re sinking deeper. So calm, so relaxed, just like sinking into a dream. And in this dream, you can still hear my voice, guiding you into a deeper tranquility. David's head nods slightly, his breathing even, deep in trance. AIMEE (whispers to Ruth) Is he...? RUTH (smiling knowingly) He’s fine, just taking a little detour through his own mind. The television continues to play in the background. David sits in quiet repose, transported by Ruth's conversational lullaby into a serene trance.

Please provide the more focused narrative please, thank you!","completion":"Certainly! Given the vast number of themes and franchises provided, I'll narrow it down to a crossover between the universes of \\"Code Geass\\" and \\"Infinite Stratos\\" with the central characters being Lelouch vi Britannia and Ichika Orimura. Lelouch will take on a mentor role for Ichika, who's grappling with his new responsibilities as the only male IS pilot. Here's a sample narrative with dialogue: --- **Chapter: The Strategy of Pilots** Within the gleaming walls of the IS Academy's highest-security training wing, Lelouch vi Britannia, the exiled prince turned revolutionary, found himself observing the world's only male IS pilot. Ichika Orimura, perplexed and anxious about the weight of expectations thrust upon him, paced back and forth before the hangar bay that housed his IS Unit. Lelouch, disguised under his teaching alias \\"Julius Kingsley,\\" approached the student thoughtfully. His involvement in the IS program was a stratagem; while helping develop strategies for the IS pilots, he sought allies for his Machiavellian chessboard against Britannia. \\"Mr. Orimura,\\" Lelouch called out, \\"you seem to be battling more than just the anticipation of the next sortie.\\" Ichika turned, his face etched with the frustrations of a day spent in the relentless pursuit of mastering the IS. \\"Mr. Kingsley,\\" Ichika acknowledged. \\"It's just... this isn't getting any easier. Everyone else seems so natural at piloting, but I'm just... not.\\" Stepping closer, Lelouch's sharp gaze met Ichika's unease. \\"In any battle, it isn't merely the skill with one's weapon that ensures victory,\\" Lelouch began. \\"It’s understanding why you fight and using that resolve to exceed your limits. Do not compare yourself to others; your path is your own.\\" Ichika's eyes flickered with the embers of determination. \\"But how can I catch up? I'm already so far behind—\\" \\"Strategy, Ichika,\\" Lelouch interjected, a hint of Zero's command seeping through his tone. \\"You leverage your unique perspective. Use tactics none of your opponents can anticipate.\\" Ichika paused, Lelouch's words igniting a spark within him. \\"You mean... improvise?\\" \\"More than that,\\" Lelouch returned. \\"Adapt. Every challenge in the simulator, use it to craft unexpected responses. The battlefield is fluid; become the one who shifts its currents.\\" Realization dawned on Ichika. \\"Shift the currents... I see. It's not about matching their pace, but about creating my own flow.\\" \\"Exactly,\\" Lelouch affirmed. \\"Now, get back to your unit. I’ve arranged for a special simulation tonight. Consider it... a practical exercise in strategy.\\" Ichika nodded and turned towards his IS. \\"Thank you, Mr. Kingsley. I won't let this chance go to waste.\\" As Ichika disappeared into the hangar, Lelouch permitted himself a thin smile. Here was a piece with potential, one who could, in time, turn the tide in the grand game against his own homeland. Unseen behind his stoic demeanor, plans unfolded like intricate origami within the mind of the deposed prince. The stage was set, pieces were in motion, and Lelouch's game had only just begun. --- The dialogue illustrates parallels between strategy concepts in war and personal development, an intersection Lelouch embodies and Ichika needs to explore to succeed. This scene establishes their dynamic and sets the stage for future growth and possible geopolitical intrigue."},{"prompt":"What countries should Marks and Spencer consider trading intetnationally or operating for the first time","completion":"As of my last update, Marks & Spencer (M&S), a major British retailer, had stores and operations in a number of countries around the world through various models, including owned stores, franchises, and online operations. When considering which countries Marks & Spencer should consider trading in or operating for the first time, several factors need to be taken into account: 1. Economic Stability: Nations with stable economies are typically more attractive for retailers as they offer a predictable business environment. 2. Consumer Purchasing Power: Countries with a growing middle class and increasing disposable incomes can present significant opportunities for retailers. 3. Legal and Regulatory Environment: Countries with clear and business-friendly regulations make it easier and less risky to operate and can influence the decision to enter a market. 4. Market Saturation: Markets that are not yet saturated with Western retailers, or those that have a demand for British-branded goods could be particularly lucrative. 5. Cultural Compatibility: Countries with an affinity for British culture and brands may be more receptive to M&S's offering. 6. E-commerce Potential: Markets with a high internet penetration rate and growing online shopping trends can be entered through e-commerce before setting up physical stores. 7. Supply Chain and Logistics: Countries with well-developed infrastructure and logistics capabilities would enable M&S to maintain their supply chain standards. Based on those considerations, potential new markets might include: - Emerging markets in Asia such as Vietnam or Indonesia, where there is a growing middle class and increasing demand for Western products. - Certain African countries, like Ghana or Kenya, which have relatively stable economies and growing urban centers. - Some Latin American countries like Colombia or Peru, which have been showing economic progress and may have untapped potential for British retailers. - Certain Eastern European countries where M&S does not yet have a presence and where there is a developing demand for quality Western goods. Please note, the decision to enter a new market should be preceded by extensive market research and analysis, taking into account both macroeconomic factors and consumer behavior specific to the retail sector that M&S operates in. Also, the company's current strategy, resources, and long-term vision must be aligned with any international expansion plans."},{"prompt":"Which potential markets should Marks and Spencer consider for trading intetnationally and operating in for the first time","completion":"When considering potential new markets for international trading and operations, companies like Marks & Spencer can evaluate a number of emerging and developing economies, as well as developed markets where they currently don't have a presence. Here are some potential options that M&S might consider, keeping in mind that they should conduct thorough market research and analysis to determine the viability and strategic fit for their brand: 1. **South America:** - **Chile:** Known for economic stability and openness to international trade. - **Argentina:** Despite some economic challenges, it has a sizable middle class and an appreciation for European brands. 2. **Central America:** - **Costa Rica:** Stable, growing economy with a reputation for being business-friendly and having strong tourism. 3. **Asia:** - **Philippines:** A large population with increasing purchasing power and a familiarity with Western brands. - **Vietnam:** Rapidly growing economy with young consumers who are enthusiastic about international brands. - **Malaysia:** A multicultural country that is economically stable and has a demand for quality international goods. 4. **Eastern Europe:** - **Romania and Bulgaria:** EU member states with developing economies and potential for retail expansion. - **Croatia:** With its EU membership and strategic location, Croatia offers access to regional markets. 5. **Africa:** - **Nigeria:** One of the largest economies in Africa with a young, entrepreneurial population. - **Kenya:** A hub for East Africa, known for its robust economy and strategic location. 6. **Middle East:** - **United Arab Emirates (UAE):** If M&S is not fully utilizing the Gulf region, the UAE (specifically Dubai and Abu Dhabi) is well-known for luxury shopping and a significant expatriate population. - **Qatar:** With high GDP per capita and significant expat community, Qatar could be a good market for premium brands. 7. **Oceania:** - **New Zealand:** A developed market with close cultural ties to the UK and a preference for quality goods. For Marks & Spencer's specific case, the choice of a new market would depend on several strategic factors, such as: - The company's long-term business goals. - The brand's adaptability to different cultural tastes and preferences. - Local competition and market saturation in the retail segment. - Legal, tax, and trade considerations in the potential market. - Cost and ease of commodities supply chain management. - E-commerce and digital infrastructure for online retail. It's important to note that while M&S has historically been a brick-and-mortar retailer, the rise of digital commerce means that they can also consider entering new markets through an online-first approach before investing in physical stores. This reduces initial costs and allows the company to test the waters and build a customer base with less financial risk. Before taking any strategic decisions, M&S would need to conduct thorough market analysis and draw from the latest intelligence to ensure the selected market offers a viable opportunity for success."},{"prompt":"Has Marks and Spencer traded internationally or operated in New Zealand","completion":"As of my last update in 2023, Marks & Spencer (M&S) had notably focused its international operations on markets in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and had an online presence in various other locations through its global e-commerce platforms.

Nevertheless, New Zealanders have been able to shop from Marks & Spencer through their international online shopping platform, which delivers a range of M&S products to many countries across the world, including New Zealand. This allows customers in these countries to purchase M&S goods without the need for a physical store in their country. It's important to note that retail strategies and market presences are subject to change. M&S has, in the past, made strategic changes to its international operations, including exiting markets and changing the nature of its presence in others, based on business performance and strategic fit.

M&S stores can be found in key locations in Qatar, offering a range of products from clothing, food, home products, and more.

Light novel genre: everyday life, school, romantic comedy. The main character is Rina Himura and she is a 2-C at Kaisei Secondary School student. Fate pits her against a mysterious player. This player was her classmate who, for unknown reasons, stopped going to school a year ago. Rina didn’t know her because she transferred after her classmate stopped going to school. This mysterious student was Konoha Misumi. There was another student in Rina's class, Eiichi Uehara. He was always a loner and had no friends either among his classmates or in life.","completion":"**Chapter 1: The Unseen Challenger** The soft hum of the computer filled the room as the last slivers of dusk slipped through the curtains. Rina Himura sat back in her chair, her eyes locked onto the glowing screen, where digital avatars danced and darted across virtual landscapes. She was absorbed, her hands moving with practiced precision as she guided her character through the online world. In this realm, she was not just Rina, the unassuming transfer student to Kaisei Secondary School's 2-C class; here, she was RinRinGamer, a name that carried weight among the high scorers and strategy forums. Kaisei Secondary was a vibrant hub of youthful energy and endless chatter, or so it seemed to anyone not named Rina Himura. To her, school was another level in a game, a complex social setting with its own set of rules and a hierarchy she was still trying to decode. After all, she had only been there since after \\"that incident,\\" as the rumours whispered in the hallways about a student named Konoha Misumi, who had vanished from the school's social scene without a trace. Rina's train of thought was derailed as a chime signaled a new message on her gaming interface. It was from 'PhantomZero,' an enigmatic player with whom she'd been competing relentlessly over the past few weeks. 'Your moves are getting predictable, RinRinGamer. Care to take on a real challenge?' the message taunted. Rina couldn't suppress the excitement coursing through her veins. 'PhantomZero' had proven to be a worthy adversary, pushing her to her limits. Whoever they were, they played like a professional, exploiting weaknesses with relentless precision. But Rina was not deterred; she thrived on competition, and this was the ultimate boss battle she didn't even know she needed. --- The next morning, the chatter of students enveloped Rina as she made her way through the corridors of Kaisei Secondary. It was just another day, but the buzz of her recent exchange with 'PhantomZero' lingered in the back of her mind, casting a veil of mystery over her mundane routine. Sliding into her seat, she noticed Eiichi Uehara giving her a peculiar glance from across the classroom. He was an enigma, always wrapped in silence, like a stoic guardian observing the chaos around him. Eiichi never participated in class banter, and as far as Rina knew, he spent his breaks alone, immersed in books or lost in the music from his headphones. As the noise of the chattering peers swelled around her, Rina couldn't help but feel a tinge of kinship with Eiichi's solace. Despite her newfound status as a well-liked student, the isolation of her first days at Kaisei Secondary echoed in her memory, echoing with the ghostly absence of Konoha Misumi. The bell signaled the beginning of the school day, and Ms. Aoi, their homeroom teacher, breezed into the room with a smile. But it was the announcement that followed that seized everyone's attention. \\"I have good news,\\" Ms. Aoi said, her voice a mix of excitement and solemnity. \\"Next week, we will be welcoming back a student who has been absent for quite some time due to personal circumstances. I expect everyone to be welcoming and supportive.\\" Rina could hear the whispers already igniting like wildfire. Was Konoha Misumi returning? What would it mean for the class and the delicate equilibrium she’d found? As school life trudged along its well-trodden tracks of home economics and algebra, Rina's mind was a battleground, strategies forming and reforming with each new piece of information. A part of her wondered if 'PhantomZero' was connected to Konoha's story, or perhaps, was Eiichi's aloofness a mask for a more profound connection to the game? Unbeknownst to Rina, the pieces on the board of her life were moving, set in motion by the whims of fate and the invisible strings of a digital realm where every player held secrets in their hearts. The stage was set, and the game had just begun. And so, in this world of everyday life, school, and romantic comedy, the story of Rina Himura, her mysterious unseen challenger, and the lone wolf Eiichi Uehara was about to unfold in a way none of them could have predicted."},{"prompt":"Write a dialogue-filled chapter for a interesting, riveting, action-packed, page-turning, and descriptive lengthy action military mystery science epic war strategy alternate historical drama high urban cosmic horror space opera fantasy supernatural vampire mecha geopolitical techno-thriller with elements of an erotic, highly-perverted Lovecraftian romantic high fantasy harem romantic comedy slice-of life mecha monster girl martial arts Japanese light novel Chinese wuxia cultivation style story, as a crossover fanfic between the Code Geass anime, video game, manga, and light novel franchise, the obscure Kanokon manga and anime franchise, the Musume Hyakka Jiten [Monster Girl Encyclopedia |Musume Hyakka Jiten|] literature and video game franchise, the Monmusume Kuesto!

The Fourier transform will decompose the signal into its frequency components, including the amplitudes and phases of these components. The real part will correspond to the in-phase component (cosine term) and the imaginary part will correspond to the quadrature component (sine term) of the signal's frequency spectrum. Here’s a basic approach to computing the real and imaginary parts for the fundamental frequency component of the AC signal using an FFT: 1. Gather your signal data: You should have a set of measurements of the AC signal's amplitude at specific time intervals and total time for the signal. 2. Normalize the time: Before starting, make sure your time array is normalized such that ( t = 0 ) represents the first data point and ( t = T ) is the final data point, where ( T ) is the total time recorded. 3. Compute the FFT: Apply an FFT to your signal data. Most computational tools such as Python (with NumPy or SciPy), MATLAB, or Octave have built-in FFT functions. Suppose your time-domain signal is given by an array \`signal\` and assuming the sampling rate is consistent: \`\`\`python import numpy as np # Your signal data and time array signal = np.array([...]) # replace [...] with your signal data time = np.linspace(0, total_time, len(signal), endpoint=False) # create a time array # Perform the FFT signal_fft = np.fft.fft(signal) \`\`\` 4. Extract the real and imaginary parts: The FFT result will be an array of complex numbers. The real parts will provide you with the cosine components, and the imaginary parts will give you the sine components for each frequency. \`\`\`python real_parts = signal_fft.real imaginary_parts = signal_fft.imag \`\`\` 5. Identify the fundamental frequency: Since you know the number of periods and the total time for the signal, you can calculate the fundamental frequency as: \`\`\`python fundamental_frequency = num_periods / total_time \`\`\` 6. Find the index of the fundamental frequency in the FFT result. This depends on the sampling frequency and the length of the signal. However, usually, it's the first non-zero frequency component. 7. Extract the real and imaginary parts of the fundamental frequency: \`\`\`python fundamental_index = 1 # Typically the first non-zero frequency (assuming the 0-th index is DC) real_part_fundamental = real_parts[fundamental_index] imaginary_part_fundamental = imaginary_parts[fundamental_index] \`\`\` Please note that if the exact sampling frequency and times are known, and if you're only interested in the real and imaginary parts of a single frequency (like the fundamental frequency), you could also perform the DFT manually for that specific frequency. Remember that when you use FFT to analyze your AC signal, the sampling theorem must be obeyed. Therefore, your signal's sampling frequency should be at least twice the highest frequency component within the signal to avoid aliasing. This is a high-level explanation, and the actual implementation will depend on the specific details of your data and requirements. Make sure to adapt the indexing and calculations based on your exact data and the conventions of the FFT library you are using."},{"prompt":"can i derive the real and imaginary parts without calculating the signal frequency? directly with time and number of periods?","completion":"If you're not looking to compute the frequency components of the signal but want to determine the real and imaginary parts of the AC signal at each point in time directly from time-domain data, the task becomes a bit ambiguous because an AC signal's real and imaginary parts are inherently tied to its representation in the frequency domain. Nonetheless, under certain assumptions and a simple model, you can attempt an approximation. Let's say your AC signal is a pure sinusoidal of the form: [ V(t) = A cos(2 pi f t + phi) ] where: - ( A ) is the amplitude - ( f ) is the frequency - ( t ) is the time - ( phi ) is the phase shift For real-time points, the real part of the signal is just the signal itself (as it represents the amplitude of the cosine wave). However, if by imaginary part you mean a representation of the sine component, you might imply injecting a phase shift of 90 degrees (( frac{pi}{2} ) radians) to the signal. This would only make sense if your signal is complex to begin with or if you're dealing with an analytic representation of the signal (where the original signal has been transformed to have both real and imaginary parts). Assuming you want to assume or create an analytic signal using your real data, you could: 1) Calculate the frequency given that you have the total time and the number of periods. The fundamental frequency is: [ f = frac{text{number of periods}}{text{total time}} ] 2) Assume there’s an imaginary part that is 90 degrees out of phase with your real data. That means for each time point ( t_i ) in your real signal ( V(t_i) ), you can create an imaginary part by applying a phase shift of 90 degrees. If your signal is indeed sinusoidal, the imaginary part ( V_{text{imag}}(t_i) ) at time ( t_i ) is: [ V_{text{imag}}(t_i) = A sin(2 pi f t_i + phi) ] This can be done without calculating the sine for each point if you have the corresponding cosine values by using the quadrature (imaginary) relationship from a Hilbert transform. However, creating this from scratch would in fact require a type of Fourier transform. If you still want to avoid frequency calculation, you can estimate the imaginary part using a Hilbert transform directly on your time-domain data if you have the necessary computational tools (e.g., \`hilbert\` function in MATLAB or SciPy in Python). The Hilbert transform gives you an analytic signal ( V_{text{analytic}}(t) ) in which the real part is your original signal and the imaginary part is the 90-degree phase-shifted version of your signal. \`\`\`python from scipy.signal import hilbert # Your original signal data signal = np.array([...]) # replace [...] with your signal data # Compute the analytic signal using a Hilbert transform analytic_signal = hilbert(signal) # Decompose into real and imaginary parts real_part = np.real(analytic_signal) imaginary_part = np.imag(analytic_signal) \`\`\` This will give you arrays representing the real and imaginary parts of the analytic signal constructed from your original real signal. Please note that here the \\"imaginary part\\" does not correspond to a physically meaningful quantity. It's a mathematical construct useful for signal analysis. Remember, the concept of real and imaginary parts of a signal assumes a complex representation, which is most intuitive when analyzing the signal in the frequency domain or when the signal is naturally complex. Without a specific context or a complex representation, an AC signal measured in the time domain is purely real."},{"prompt":"Создай шесть разных уникальных,читабельных негативных отзыва о неудачной покупке автомобиля в салоне Ац Профсоюз.

I'm a guy in college. I have a skater style. I live in a dorm room. I have blonde messy hair and no facial hair and pierced ears. I have a male roommate with an extremely Italian look, hairstyle, and facial hair, and no piercings. One week he goes home to Italy. I stay in the dorm. Through a series of unfortunate events over the span of a day I end up looking like him and wearing his clothes. I didn't intend for this and am very embarrassed. I get locked out of my dorm room so I can't change myself back. His Italian friends who also attend our college spot me and assume I'm him and bring me along for their day and I end up spending the night in one of his male friend's dorm rooms under the guise of being my roommate. I also have to imitate his accent and way of speaking and interests","completion":"The sun poured through the blinds with an assertive warmth on a Monday morning, and I rolled over in bed, blinking against the intrusion. My roommate, Marco, had left for Italy just the weekend prior, leaving me alone in our shared dorm room. A guy in college, I was known for my skater style—loose tees, beanie hats, and worn-out sneakers. My blonde, messy hair, always sticking in odd directions, was as much a part of my signature look as my pierced ears. In contrast, Marco was a poster boy for Italian charm: slicked-back hair, an always-perfect five o'clock shadow, and not a piercing in sight. Now, I had the space all to myself, or so I thought—until I somehow created a series of mishaps that turned into a complete and utterly embarrassing transformation. It started with a morning shower. The dorm's aging plumbing decided to give out just as I was mid-shampoo, forcing me to rinse my hair in the sink. All we had was Marco's musky-scented, extra-strong hair gel, which I never used. But with shampoo still foaming in my eyes and no other choice, I grabbed the bottle and worked it through my hair. The result? My blonde locks lay slicked back in a style that screamed Marco. Desperate to get out of the steamy bathroom and cool down, I threw open his wardrobe by mistake. As I wiped the steam from my eyes, I accidentally grabbed his clothes, pulling on a plain white tee and slim-fit jeans. A glance in the mirror should've tipped me off, but I was too flustered to notice the doppelganger effect. By the time I realized my mistake, the day's momentum had swept me along. Appointments and classes blurred together until I needed a breather. I decided to hit the skate park to clear my head, but of course, one colossal wipeout later, I found my shirtsleeve torn and knee scratched up. I limped back to the dorm, only to discover my key card was missing. Now, locked out and looking nothing like my usual self, my unlucky day took an even stranger turn. Marco's Italian friends, Lorenzo and Matteo, rounded the corner, and their faces lit up with recognition—or so they thought. \\"Ey, Marco! Che fai qui?\\" they called out, mistaking me for him. I tried to correct them, but the words tangled up in my throat. They were already ushering me off, convinced I was pulling a gag. Flustered and without options, I went along with it, fear knotting in my stomach. The day passed in a blur. I was dragged from Italian restaurants to an espresso bar, my stomach churning not from the food but the charade. Keeping up with their conversation required patching together film quotes and broken Italian phrases I'd picked up from Marco, my fake accent teetering on the edge of a disaster. Every time I thought it couldn't get more uncomfortable, it did. I had to feign interest in soccer, discuss Italian politics, and even sing a verse of a song Marco always hummed. It was a crash course in being Marco, and I was barely scraping a pass. The sun dipped low, casting an orange glow over the campus as the evening approached. I should've been back in my own room, as myself, but instead, I was being pulled into another dorm room by Matteo, who insisted, \\"Marco, amico, you're too funny today! You will stay with me tonight, si?\\" With a sense of surreal defeat, I nodded. The room's mirror finally revealed the complete picture: me, looking like a clone of my Italian roommate. Pierced skater guy turned Italian doppelganger, and I couldn't help but laugh at the absurdity. Even my laugh sounded different. That night, lying awake on the unfamiliar bed in Matteo's dorm, I made a silent promise. First thing tomorrow, I would get back into my room, wash off this unlikely disguise, and return to being the skater guy with the messy blonde hair. But until then, I'd keep up the act; the accidental Italian falling asleep under a poster of the Roman Colosseum, far from the skateboards and baggy clothes that told the world who I really was. If nothing else, it'd be one hell of a story to tell Marco when he got back. Maybe, just maybe, he'd get a good laugh out of it, too."},{"prompt":"Rewrite the above but have Marco dress like an extremely Italian man and have black hair and facial hair and have tan skin (vs my pale skin). Also have the series of unfortunate events be more elaborate and add more to change my hair color, give me facial hair, change my tan, put me in Marco's signature scent, and cram me into Marco's shoes","completion":"The sun pierced through the blinds with an unapologetic zeal, marking the onset of an ordinary college day for me—a skater guy with distinctly non-Italian features: pale skin, blonde messy hair, and no facial hair to speak of. Marco, my college roommate, was his polar opposite. With his impeccably styled black hair, signature scent, and a tan that spoke of his Mediterranean heritage, he exuded an air of Italian sophistication. I woke up to an empty silence, the kind that yells at you when you've been left all on your own. Marco had flown home to Italy for a week, and I was king of our small dormitory kingdom—or so I thought. Little did I know that I was about to embark on a chaotic quest that would leave me in a farcical Italian charade. The comedy of errors began with a botched attempt at self-tanning. A campus event called for a \\"cultural immersion\\" dress-up, and half-asleep me thought, why not give it a go? I grabbed some of Marco's tan lotion, assuming it was just moisturizer. As the day progressed, my skin turned a suspicious shade of orange, a glaring contrast to my usually pale complexion. This was only the first step of my transformation. As I attempted to style my hair, there was a fateful mix-up with the products on our shared bathroom shelf. I grabbed what I thought was hair bleach to lighten the emerging roots of my darkened hair but ended up mistaking a semi-permanent black dye as Marco's hair solution was in nearly an identical container. The moment I washed it out, I gasped at the reflection of a man with Marco's hair color—not at all blending in with my skater vibe. In my colorblind panic, I didn't notice that my phone, my lifeline to someone who might help, had dropped into the sink, sizzling to its demise in a puddle of water. Now isolated, the very thought of stepping out brought chills down my spine. The once welcoming day felt more like a spotlight on a stage I didn't wish to perform on. My next misadventure was with facial hair—or the lack thereof. As I pondered my dilemma, I spotted Marco's theatrical beard from a past costume party, laughed at by all that time. Desperate times call for ridiculous measures—I cut and pasted segments onto my jawline, crafting an imitation of Marco's perfectly sculpted facial hair. Clad in leftover self-tan, with dark hair and a faux beard, I thought things could not escalate. But I was wrong. The universe had not yet done with me. I accidentally spilled coffee on my favorite skater shirt. Swearing under my breath, I had no choice but to raid Marco's wardrobe. His clothes hugged close to my frame, a stark departure from my baggy skater attire. For the finishing touch, I slipped into Marco's Italian leather shoes, squeezing my larger feet into their polished, unyielding confines. I reeked of Marco's signature cologne, a potent concoction he used that somehow survived my frantic morning—it was, unfortunately, the result of a perfume bottle shattering against the tiled floor, dousing me completely. Just as I deemed my day couldn't get any more twisted, I turned the doorknob to realize I was locked out. This was ironic considering that inside lay every item I needed to reclaim my identity but was now barred access to. This was when fate decided to twist the knife—a group of Marco's Italian compatriots walked by. \\"Ciao, Marco! You look... different today. Festive, amico?\\" they chuckled, approaching with curious grins. They mistook my silence for coy humor. Before I knew it, I was shepherded into a day filled with \\"Marco's favorite things,\\" trying to blend in with half-baked Italian phrases and nods. And as the sun dipped below the horizon and my skater persona faded further into obscurity, the realization dawned on me—I'd have to spend a whole night impersonating my roommate, lest I give up the whole charade. The evening ended with an impromptu stay at one of the Italian group's dorm rooms, where I lay on a way-too-short couch, still clad in Marco’s tight clothes, my feet aching in his snug shoes. All the while, my mind raced with how Marco would react upon seeing his grinning doppelgänger's retelling of the day's escapades: the skater guy who accidentally became the caricature of an Italian roommate through a cascade of improbable transformations."},{"prompt":"Создай шесть разных уникальных,читабельных негативных отзыва о неудачной покупке автомобиля в салоне Ац Профсоюз.

Whatever works. Currently still running with the normal dancers idents (when will they be retired, they've been used since 2002) Emma said on 01 December 2023 Hopefully S4C does something with their new blob mascot, Last year they had TV sets stacked up on top of each other, Then for 10 months they had flickering TV sets, They have finally rebranded and have introduced their first ever mascot: a shape-shifting blob, I hope BBC One rebrand soon, those dancers sure are getting tired, As for the KikoRiki themed Christmas idents, I was told they are launching tonight after Doctor Who, They are being introduced just before Unbreakable. HouseofFun said on 01 December 2023 Doctor Who ending now, announcement playing \\"A team of 8 people are pushed to the absolute limit, Unbreakable, our brand new game show is up next, But first, Time to say hello and spend Christmas with the Doctor\\" I'm not liking this one a whole lot..., They seem to be running a trailer advertising the Doctor Who Christmas special, which revolves around the Doctor having to protect his companions from a man who seeks to find a fob watch (the one The Doctor made himself human with one time), Although just before Doctor Who tonight they had a announcement saying \\"Christmas is switched on tonight in 1 hour in time for Unbreakable, But first, Is this the end for the Doctor?\\". Doesn't seem like they are advertising the Christmas pres at all, Edit: Christmas pres featuring KikoRiki switched on, First ident shown features Rosa the Pig doing a dramatic ice skate dance (She even uses eyedrops for fake tears) While this is happening we hear dramatic music, The announcer says \\"Welcome to Christmas on BBC One, Let us entertain you, But now a team of 8 people are being pushed to their absolute limits, Are they Unbreakable?\\" Not sure why they didn't tell us it was happening untill it did, But still a gorgeous ident, I noticed when the Announcer started talking it sounded as if he was driven to tears by the beauty of Rosa's gorgeous dance. The best thing to come out of this package since the \\"Lights\\" christmas idents in 2006, Eyes said on 01 December 2023 A beautiful ident, Best thing to come out of the \\"Rythm and Movement\\" package since those Planet Earth 3 special idents a few months ago, i feel sad that KikoRiki has not been shown much on CBBC on BBC Two, but I'm glad it's representing the Xmas idents on BBC One (Although I also wish the idents also featured a merman). Maile said on 01 December 2023 Best Christmas ident in a while, I just love that they have spent it with Rosa and her friends, I hear there is also one featuring Krash the Rabbit opening his presents, I like how they used the usual ident theme (dancing) in that first ident, KikoRiki looks like it's gonna be good this year, but I hope they do more with the style (and maybe finally retire Rythm and Movement idents) Faramad said on 01 December 2023 News safe ident just on, Basically just a Christmas tree on a snowy background, with a music box Silent Night playing, on top of that the only thing we see is a sleeping Rosa (We vaguely hear her snoring) Glad they are now using characters in their news safe idents, Announcer said \\"Now on BBC One, time for the BBC News at 8\\". Remember the Lights idents the used just before overhauling their promo style in late 2006/early 2007? That was pretty cool, but this is way better. I seem to remember those idents started on a dark street but Christmas lights started turning on before it got to a city center and then people were dancing, It was used again in 2007, And now it seems like the \\"Project Chameleon\\" endboard template introduced in July is out the window, at least for now, replaced with a snowy background with a Christmas tree on it. Signs that Rythm and Movement is finally working towards the end. KikoRiki said on 01 December 2023 We're glad you love our cartoon and the special BBC One idents featuring our characters, However, Rosa will be the star, (We will have idents revolving around Chiko, Krash and the others), As to what you said, BBC One are looking into introducing the Circle idents already in use in other countries, so don't expect to see Ballet, Capoeria or Festival/Rave back in the new year. Get used to Kites, Capes, Hippos and Bikes as that's what might be coming after our Christmas campaign, We don't know for certain, but the Dancers might not be coming back after Christmas WhovianForever: Did everyone catch the Doctor Who Christmas special announcement during the news? I’m so hyped! Can’t wait to see how the Doctor deals with the fob watch saga this holiday season! LemonyFan: And how about they’re showing the 2004 ‘A Series of Unfortunate Events’ movie!! That’s one of my holiday favorites; the nostalgia is real. 😍🍿 ChristmasCarol: Truly is shaping up to be a wonderful holiday schedule on BBC One. Between Doctor Who and the classic movies, I’m going to be glued to my screen with all the mulled wine and mince pies! KikoFanatic: Plus, the KikoRiki Christmas idents have been adorable so far! Rosa’s ice skate dance nearly brought tears to my eyes just like the announcer. 🐷⛸ Christmas is definitely switched on! RetroTV: I’m just here wondering if the new ‘Circle’ idents KikoRiki hinted at is a sign we’re finally saying goodbye to the “Rythm and Movement” package for good. After 20+ years, it’s about time for a major refresh! NostalgiaNerd: @RetroTV I’m with you on that. The Lights idents back in '06/'07 were beautiful. It’s cool to see they’re still willing to shake things up visually with the news safe ident this year. Sleepy Rosa might just be my new favorite. 😴🎄 SeriesBinger: Doctor Who special + A Series of Unfortunate Events + KikoRiki idents = Best Christmas TV lineup or what? Also, hope BBC One throws in some classic Christmas episodes of our favorite shows. Maybe some ‘Vicar of Dibley’ or ‘Only Fools and Horses’? CircleCurious: Anyone heard more about these new Circle idents? I love change, and KikoRiki characters have been great, but I’m already excited for what’s coming next. Bring on the new era! KikoLover: Just saw a new Krash and Chiko ident! They’re having a blast playing in the snow! ❄️🐇 So cute watching Krash throw snowballs while Chiko dodges around. Really captures the winter fun vibes. SciFiSavvy: Speaking of new idents, did anyone else notice the Dokko the Moose building a laser device ident? It aired right before ‘Doctor Who’ and set the PERFECT tone for sci-fi. Dokko’s always been the tech genius of the group. 🦌🔧 HedgehogAdmirer: @KikoLover Chiko is always adorable, but seeing him in the snow was next level! BBC One knows how to do Christmas idents right. Plus, the animation on these characters in the idents is super impressive this year. WhovianGuru: @SciFiSavvy Loved the Dokko ident! It’s like a mini episode of ‘Doctor Who’ in itself. Brilliant tie-in to the show’s theme! Makes waiting for the Christmas special even more exciting. BakeMaster: But guys, let’s talk about the Olga the Owl baking ident. The detail on that gingerbread house she was making! I can almost smell the cookies through the screen. 🦉🍪 It’s the cozy ident I never knew I needed in my life. HolidayWatcher: Right?! The Olga ident feels like being wrapped in a warm blanket with a hot chocolate in hand. It’s chef’s kiss perfection. BBC One’s going all out with these KikoRiki characters for Christmas. DoctorFan: Dokko’s ident was like a mini teaser for what’s coming with ‘Doctor Who’. Immersive and full of that tech mystery vibe. I appreciate that BBC One creates these unique intros for thematic continuity. AnimationAppreciator: Major kudos to the animation team for the KikoRiki idents. As someone who dabbles in animation, the quality is sensational. It’s like a little holiday gift before each show starts! ChristmasCheer: Can’t get enough of the snow play with Krash and Chiko. It’s absolutely delightful and spreads so much joy. These little moments provided by the idents add a special touch to the holiday season. SciCompanion: Dokko and his inventions always remind me that anything’s possible with a little imagination. Such an inspiring ident to lead into ‘Doctor Who’. Well played, BBC One! Can’t wait to see what else is in store, I'm gonna miss these idents when new year comes around! 😢 WelcomeToSciFi: The Dokko centric ident really sets the scene for what's to come on ‘Doctor Who’ this Christmas. One of the best things about the KikoRiki set, Far better than the usual dancers, Come to think of it, they have been using the dancers since 2002, so now is a good time for a revamp, I guess 😉 Olgo5: Just saw the Olga ident and damn, Olga really is a talented chef, They always seem to show it before cooking shows, Which ident normally leads into Eastenders, It seems to vary between Krash and Chiko in the snow, Olga cooking and Rosa ice skating. Not sure how this is consistent, But that Rosa one brings tears to my eyes with her graceful skating, Not sure why the Dokko one only plays before Doctor Who, Maybe because it fits it well. Write a follow up on January 1 where the Christmas idents are removed at 1am at closedown, final one is Sleeping Rosa, The announcer says the usual idents (against all the odds) are returning at 6am but the announcer says goodnight to Rosa before letting the ident play in full before News 24 starts","completion":"On January 1, 2024, as the final echoes of holiday celebrations fade into memory, BBC One marks the end of an enchanting chapter in its broadcasting history. As the clock strikes 1 am, the screen glows with the now-familiar sight of a tranquil, sleep-enveloped Rosa, the animated pig from the world of KikoRiki, slumbering gently against a snowy backdrop adorned with a singular Christmas tree. The delicate chimes of \\"Silent Night\\" from a music box fill the air, a soothing lullaby that has signified the news-safe backdrop during the festive season. In the corner of the screen, the iconic BBC One logo shimmers softly, a reminder of the network's role as a staple in homes across the nation during this time of year. The announcer, with a wistful tone, bids the audience goodnight, expressing a final moment of gratitude toward Rosa for her delightful company throughout December's wintery cheer. \\"It's time to say goodnight to Rosa—and farewell to our Christmas idents,\\" the voice warmly intones. \\"Rest assured, when we return at 6 am, we'll be welcoming back some familiar faces.\\" As the scene fades, the idyllic image of Rosa remains on the screen, permitted a few seconds longer in the spotlight, uninterrupted by announcements or transitions. It's a serene endcap to the jubilant Christmas season, afforded the rare opportunity to be appreciated in full stillness and quiet. The tranquility is eventually broken as the BBC One feed crosses into BBC News 24, signifying that the whimsy of the holiday programming has come to a close. Morning will bring the return of the standard \\"Rythm and Movement\\" idents, surprising those who speculated that the long-standing visuals may finally retire after two decades of service. Viewers, greeted with the absence of endearing, skating pigs and playful snowball fights among animated friends, face the return of the station's usual formality. While this resurrection of the “Rythm and Movement” idents might seem a step back into the familiar past for some, others hold hope for whispers of a future transformation with the Circle idents, teased by the KikoRiki characters bidding their temporary farewell to the BBC One screen. In the stillness of the early hours of the new year, as the last of the Christmas magic wanes, nostalgia tinges the air — a collective anticipation lingers for what the future holds regarding the evolution of BBC One's on-screen identity."},{"prompt":"Write a follow up in December 2024 where no new Christmas idents are used, Instead, a previous year is reused for the very first time","completion":"December 2024: As December embraces the nation with its frosty arms, viewers tuning into BBC One for their dose of festive spirit encounter an unexpected case of seasonal déjà vu. This year, instead of unveiling a brand-new set of Christmas idents, BBC One takes an unprecedented step into the annals of festive broadcasting by reprising an earlier year's set — a first in the network's long-standing tradition of annual holiday refreshes. The charming KikoRiki cast that graced the screens last Christmas makes an unanticipated return, with Rosa the Pig, Krash the Rabbit, Chiko, and the rest of the gang reprising their roles in the idents that captured the hearts of viewers the yule before. Snowballs fly, ice skates glide, and gingerbread houses rise once more as these whimsical animations play out in the junctions between programs, a grounded familiarity in an ever-changing world. Audiences, initially puzzled by the lack of new holiday illustrations, soon embrace the throwback. Social media erupts into a blend of nostalgia and debate, with hashtags like #KikoRikiChristmasEncore and #BBCOneRetroXmas trending nationwide. While some express disappointment at missing out on freshly minted visuals to accompany their minced pies and mulled wine, many find comfort in the familiarity of last season's offerings, which now feel like old friends returning to share another mug of cheer. BBC One's decision to recycle previous idents is met with varied reactions: - ChristmasClassicFan: \\"So surprised to see last year's #KikoRiki gang back on my screen! They're adorable, but I was really looking forward to something new. 😔🎄 #BBCOneXmas\\" - RetroLover: \\"Kind of loving the replay of last year's Christmas idents on #BBCOne! It's like watching a favorite holiday movie that you never get tired of. #OldieButGoodie 🐇❄️\\" - BudgetWatcher: \\"In these economical times, maybe reusing last year's idents isn't such a bad idea. They're still cute, and it saves money, right? #PracticalChristmas 🐷💷\\" - KikoFan2023: \\"YES! More of Rosa and friends for Christmas. Last year's idents were so beautiful, they deserve an encore! 🎉 #KikoRikiChristmasEncore\\" While the warm familiarity of repeat idents is welcomed in many homes, the broadcasters at BBC One understand the varying tastes of their audience and promise that this year's recycled cheer aligns with a larger vision for the future. \\"No one cherishes the festive season and its traditions more than we do,\\" explains a network spokesperson. \\"This year, we made the decision to bring back the beloved animations from last Christmas as part of a sustainable, thoughtful approach to our holiday presentation. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, our creative teams are channeling their efforts into crafting a spectacular set of idents for the next year that will set a bold new direction for our holiday broadcasts.\\" BBC One, while taking a moment to reflect and recycle, hints at a grand reveal to come; a new festive chapter is being written, one that requires an extra year of patience from its eagerly awaiting audience. Until then, viewers continue to enjoy the encore presentation of KikoRiki’s Christmas adventures, a cheery, recycled reminder of yuletides past, and the ongoing joy and connection that the holiday season brings. Whether reveling in the return of the animated ensemble or yearning for something new, the nation settles into the festive season unified by the twinkling glow of the television screen, ready to embrace the comfort and continuity offered by BBC One's classic holiday idents."},{"prompt":"You are a UK scriptwriter with a talent for natural dialogue and a deep knowledge of hypnosis inductions. Script: David (20, uni student) is watching TV with his younger sister Ruth (16) and Ruth’s friend Aimee (16) one evening. Ruth and Aimee are barefoot on the sofa. They do not mention hypnosis or psychology. Through a covert hypnosis script, *Ruth* easily hypnotizes David into a deep trance using casual techniques, stepping it up as she continues. Aimee only chips in to mock him. No awakening scene.","completion":"[The living room is warm and cozy, the sound of a popular TV show hums in the background. David, a laid-back university student, lounges in an armchair opposite the sofa where his younger sister Ruth and her friend Aimee are sitting with their feet tucked beneath them. The mood is casual and the conversation flows between the siblings and Aimee with gentle teasing.] DAVID: (Grinning) So what's the verdict on this show then? Mind-numbing or actually kinda clever? RUTH: (Smirking playfully) Oh, come on, David. We all know you secretly love it. You're just too focussed on looking cool for uni friends. AIMEE: (Chuckles) Ruth's got a point. You analyze everything like it's a quantum physics lecture. Just chill out and watch. DAVID: (Laughs) Fine, fine. I'll give it a rest. [Ruth looks at David with a mischievous twinkle in her eye and begins talking in a smooth, rhythmic tone] RUTH: You know, sometimes it's just nice to let your mind relax, isn't it? To just...drift away from all that complex stuff. DAVID: (Slightly dismissive) Yeah, sure. Daydreaming in front of the TV. Exactly what I need. [Ruth subtly taps her fingers in a rhythmic pattern on the cushion next to her, a pattern that catches David's ear without him realizing it] RUTH: Exactly! Daydreaming. Like when you find a really comfortable spot, and everything feels just right. AIMEE: (Mocking) He wouldn't know comfort if it hit him in the face. All about 'optimal study angles' and 'ergonomic support,' aren't you, genius? [Ruth laughs softly but keeps her voice steady and inviting, drawing David's attention away from Aimee's teasing] RUTH: Ignore her, David. Sometimes you don't need the perfect angle. Just letting yourself slump, feeling your body sink into the chair, it's enough. Just like that feeling when you're about to fall asleep, remember? Heavy and light all at once. DAVID: (Smiling weakly, his attention caught) Yeah...that's not so bad. [Ruth watches David's body language, noting his eyelids growing heavier, his posture relaxing. She continues to speak in a calm, rhythmic manner] RUTH: That's right. Just like when the night is quiet, and you listen to the soft ticking of a clock, letting each tick help you focus... on how comfortable... you're becoming. AIMEE: (Snickers) Looks like Mr. Busy Brain is finally slowing down. DAVID: (His speech is slower, more drawn out) Mmm...guess I am getting... kind of tired. [Ruth subtly shifts, leaning in closer to David. She lowers her voice to a soothing whisper, still keeping that rhythmic flow] RUTH: We all need a break... sometimes. It's so easy to let go, especially when someone you trust helps guide you there. Like the way the ocean's waves gently guide seashells to the shore, back and forth, back and forth. DAVID: (His head nods slightly as his eyes flutter) That's... kind of nice. RUTH: Yeah. Nice and relaxing. Like sinking down into the warm sands of sleep, feeling safe, feeling secure. And as you listen to my voice, each word washing over you, it's all just...carrying you deeper, isn't it? DAVID: (Nods, his voice a mere whisper) Deeper... yeah. [Ruth smiles, recognizing the signs of a deepening trance. She maintains her calm, the authority in her voice growing more subtle] RUTH: And while you're there, so calm and peaceful, you can just enjoy this. Staying still, letting the world around you disappear. There's nothing to worry about, nothing to think about. Just feeling... good. AIMEE: (With a mix of mockery and awe) Look at him, out like a light. Who knew he had an off switch? [Ruth's voice dips even lower, just a soothing murmur that continues to guide David] RUTH: Everyone has an off switch, if you know where to look. Letting yourself rest, knowing that here, now, everything is just fine. And you can stay here for a while, no need to do anything, no need to say anything, just... listening and letting go. [David's breathing deepens, an indicator of his profound relaxation, as he slips further into the embrace of the trance. Ruth and Aimee exchange a knowing glance, Ruth's control over the situation evident in her steady gaze and the confident curl of her lips.] [The TV show's laughter track plays faintly in the background, the hum of dialogue melding with the scene, as the script comes to a close without any intention of bringing David out of his trance, allowing him to remain, for the time being, peacefully unaware.]"},{"prompt":"Standing up and walking over to stand in front of David, Ruth decides to fractionate her brother and take him deeper into trance.

Reaching him, she towers over his slouched form in the chair, using her height to emphasize her dominance gently.] RUTH: (Softly coaxing) David, why don't you sit up for a moment? It's nice to change pace, shift where you’re going, isn't it? [David lifts his head, his eyes still heavy but doing as he's instructed. He seems to resurface, gripping onto the frayed edges of wakefulness.] AIMEE: (Giggles) There he is. Thought we lost you to dreamland for good, Captain Snooze. DAVID: (Disoriented) Was I...? Heh, guess I zoned out. [Ruth locks eyes with David again. Her voice takes on an almost musical quality, rhythmic and engaging, beckoning him to follow her tempo.] RUTH: It's actually really nice to zone out then come back... It reminds us just how relaxing it can really be to— (Pause, reframes) do something as simple as stand up. Stand up for me David.Would you mind doing that now? [David complies in slow motion, his movements groggy and obedient.] DAVID: Sure... I can stand. [He stands but wobbles slightly, the strength of consciousness barely holding him. Ruth’s voice reasserts its gentle hold, ready to dive deeper.] RUTH: (Firmly yet softly) Focus on me David. Do you notice how clear my voice is when you really listen? Even when you were dazing off just moments ago, it still... (she lowers her voice to a hypnotic whisper) pulls you down. It's perfect for sinking even deeper. Whenever you hear my voice now, you’ll drift quickly, deeper and faster, like spiraling down a euphoria staircase. AIMEE: (Laughing) Looks like someone's power dropped to 'low battery' mode. Little brother can hardly stand up! [David's knees begin to buckle and Ruth catches his arm, emphasizing her presence and support.] RUTH: Good thing I’ve got you, right?

[David slowly reseats himself, his descent into the armchair symbolically echoing his descent back into trance. Ruth monitors each motion, his compliance reflecting the strength of her suggestions.] RUTH: Each time you sink down, David, you fall deeper into trance. Doubling it just feels... (she emphasizes the word) right.Do you feel it, David? That even-rightness? DAVID: (In a daze) Yeah... feels... good. [Ruth gives a discreet nod to Aimee, their shared scheme laced with mischief and quiet influence.] AIMEE: Stuff from a spa or something. He's basically mush. [Ruth circles David almost predatorily, her presence looming, yet oddly comforting. Her voice is the anchor in the shifting experience] RUTH: Rounded edges, David, so peaceful, so deep... Brushes of trance neither reluctant nor seeking, just existent like circles within the dreamscape of your mind. With my words so simple, your world fades to focused bliss, here...and easily stays locked there. [And with each step Ruth knows and so does Aimee, that David is enveloped in a sensation beyond words, locked within his sister's effortlessly woven net of hypnotic commands.] [The TV drones on in the background, another layer in the multiplex drifting waves, a testament to the simplicity of steering a willing mind deep into the most receptive spaces of awe.

This might include taking care of children, dealing with personal appointments, or simply working during hours when they feel most productive. 2. **No Commute:** One of the most appreciated benefits of remote work is the elimination of daily commutes. This can save people a significant amount of time and money, and it can reduce stress and exposure to traffic-related pollution. The time saved by not commuting can be used for personal interests, additional sleep, exercise, or spending time with family and friends. 3. **Work-Life Balance:** Working remotely can help people achieve a better balance between their professional and personal lives. They can create an environment that allows them to focus on work tasks without the distractions often found in traditional office settings, while also being present for life's other responsibilities and pleasures. This increased control over one's work environment often leads to greater job satisfaction and less burnout. Other reasons might include the desire for a quieter work environment, the ability to live and work from locations not near company offices (also known as digital nomadism), and sometimes even improved productivity. The specific motivations for choosing remote work can vary widely based on personal values and life circumstances."},{"prompt":"Создай шесть разных уникальных,читабельных негативных отзыва о неудачной покупке автомобиля в салоне Ац Профсоюз. Вырази все свое недовольство. Больше эмоций. Пиши на понятном русском, указывай разные модели автомобилей. Этот отзыв возьми за основу:Купил здесь Мазду тройку. Авто 2014 года, но состояние было более чем удовлетворительное. Погнался за тем, что цена в салоне стояла 890 тысяч. Крайне низкий ценник для такого авто. Учитывая, что пробег 150 тысяч, она должна стоить дороже. Оформил. Документы выдали. На учет поехать сразу ставить не удалось, поэтому какое-то время гонял на ней как есть. Когда все-таки доехал до ГАИ, да и время уже поджимало, узнал много интересного. Авто по базам ранее уже было в продаже. Продавалось первым хозяином после аварии. Правая сторона была сильно повреждена. Пробег при первой продаже уже был 110. Поскольку с того момента прошло 4 года, то можно смело говорить о том, что перед продажей в автосалоне точно скрутили его. Не понравилось данное обстоятельство. Дилера в топку!","completion":"1. Приобрел недавно в салоне Ац Профсоюз Renault Logan, и очень жалею об этом решении. Первое, что меня сразу насторожило, это давление менеджеров на скорейшее оформление сделки. Цена была заманчивая, конечно, но знал бы я, что эта скидка обернется кошмаром! Сиденья оказались протертыми, подвеска издала страшные звуки уже на второй день использования. Ощущение, что автомобиль в состоянии предсмертного хрипа! И самое неприятное – при попытке вернуть машину наткнулся на полное невнимание со стороны администрации. Это недобросовестность в чистом виде! 2. Худший опыт покупки автомобиля у меня был именно в Ац Профсоюз. Присмотрел Ford Focus, прозвучали заверения, что состояние отличное. На деле – обман! Тормозные диски изношены настолько, что о чем-то кроме замены даже речь не идёт, а кузов имел явные следы коррозии. За такие деньги ожидал намного большего. Ужасный сервис, ни ответа, ни привета от продавцов после покупки. Я чувствую себя обманутым! 3. Сплошное разочарование – вот что я почувствовал после приобретения BMW 5 серии в салоне Ац Профсоюз. Думал, куплю надежное авто, а в итоге – катастрофа. Печка греет только после 30 минут работы двигателя, коробка переключает передачи с заеданиями, будто скоро развалится. Как только покинул салон, как будто для них перестал существовать. Что за обслуживание такое? Всем советую обходить этот салон стороной! 4. \\"Ац Профсоюз\\" обернулся для меня кошмаром наяву. Взял Volkswagen Polo, но чуда не произошло – машина с пробегом 90 тысяч км оказалась усталой и изношенной. После недели эксплуатации обнаружил течь масла и скрип при повороте руля. Вот это \\"отличная\\" покупка за мои кровные! Продавцы-консультанты видят в клиенте только кошелек. Уважаемые, вы чем думаете, продавая людям такие авто?! 5. Я в гневе и разочаровании от покупки Hyundai Solaris в \\"Ац Профсоюз\\". Дешевле чем в других местах, говорили они. Спустя месяц – вкладыши стукнули, и все эти разговоры о контроле качества кажутся грубой ложью. Сначала зались медом, буквально заставляя меня купить этот автомобиль, а потом исчезли, как если бы никогда и не было никакой гарантии. Это совершенно непрофессионально и ужасающе с точки зрения бизнеса! 6. Попал на деньги к мошенникам из Ац Профсоюз! Недавно приобрел Toyota Camry, которая якобы была в \\"идеальном\\" состоянии. Оказалось, что все \\"идеальное\\" – это лишь внешний вид. Электроника выдала сбои на второй день, как будто ей сто лет в обед. Случилась перед критически важной встречей, и я опоздал!

In this lengthy essay, Putin shares his perspective on the shared history, cultural, and political connections between Russians and Ukrainians. Here are the main points articulated by Putin in the article: 1. Common Origins: Putin emphasizes the deep historical and cultural ties between Ukrainians and Russians, tracing their origins back to the medieval state of Kievan Rus', which is seen as the historical and spiritual source for both nations. 2. Shared Heritage: The article points out that Russians and Ukrainians have a shared heritage, including language, religion, and cultural traditions. Putin mentions that they both embraced Christianity from Byzantium, which had a profound impact on their development. 3. Soviet Period: Putin addresses the Soviet era, claiming that modern Ukraine was largely created during this period, with its borders shaped significantly by Soviet leaders. He argues that parts of historical Russia were consolidated into Ukrainian territory. 4. Criticism of Ukraine’s Current Policies: Putin is critical of Ukraine's post-Soviet national identity, which he feels is based on the denial of the common past with Russia. He accuses Ukrainian authorities of promoting anti-Russian sentiment and rewriting history to suit a nationalist agenda. 5. Opposition to Western Influence: The article criticizes Western countries, accusing them of using Ukraine as a tool to contain Russia, which, according to Putin, harms the interests of Ukrainian people and the wider region. 6. Political Integration Attempts: Putin mentions historical attempts to integrate the Ukrainian and Russian governance, including the Treaty of Pereyaslav in 1654, and he sees the modern separation as an anomaly. 7. The Ukrainian Question as a Security Issue: Putin discusses the eastward expansion of NATO and considers it a direct threat to Russia's security. He is particularly concerned about the prospect of Ukraine joining the NATO alliance. 8. Advocacy for Russian-speaking Ukrainians: Putin claims to advocate for the rights of Russian-speaking people in Ukraine, which he asserts are being suppressed. 9. The Future of Russian-Ukrainian Relations: Putin expresses hope for the restoration of a unified cultural and political space between the two countries and implies that this would be beneficial for both. It should be noted that Putin's views on the historical unity of Russians and Ukrainians are contested not just internationally but also by many historians and political figures within Ukraine. The Ukrainian government and many Ukrainian citizens see their history and identity as distinct, and the country has been forging its own path since it declared independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. The article predated the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Russia in February 2022, which has further exacerbated tensions and fueled significant international criticism of Russia's actions and Putin's historical narratives."},{"prompt":"You are a UK scriptwriter with a talent for natural dialogue and a deep knowledge of hypnosis inductions.

How many times can David actually pretend to care about our teenage drama? RUTH (playfully) Oh, come on, Aimee. He’s such a good brother, always lending an ear. Kind of like now, right David? Your mind just clinging to every word like it's gently pulling you down... deeper. DAVID’S head begins to dip slightly, his eyelids drooping as he continues staring at the muted TV, taking in RUTH’S words with less and less resistance. AIMEE laughs softly, watching the transformation in DAVID’S demeanor. AIMEE Though, to be fair, you’re actually paying attention for once, Dave. RUTH (silky voice) That’s right, focus on my voice, David... Feel how it carries you, like drifting on a cloud... or sinking into the softest bed... Nothing else matters but that feeling of letting go. AIMEE gazes in amazement as DAVID’S whole body begins to relax, his breathing steadying and deepening. AIMEE Am I witnessing the great David turn into a human noodle? Ruth, you’re like a magician or something. RUTH ignores AIMEE’s jest, still speaking in her smooth, rhythmical tone. RUTH You’d tell me if you felt that relaxation spread from your toes all the way up, wouldn't you, David? How it seems to make your feet feel warmer, spreading through your legs... David's feet shift slightly, and though he seems to want to answer, his lips barely move, the immersive state holding him. DAVID (mumbling) Feels...warm... AIMEE (hushed, teasingly) Looks like David’s more suggestible than we thought. RUTH (whispering to AIMEE) Sshh...it's perfect. You see, in this relaxed state, minds open up, don't they David? So calm, so open, ready to accept new ideas so easily... DAVID is almost completely still now, his head tilted slightly forward, his consciousness teetering on the edge of a deep trance. AIMEE (wide-eyed, quiet) I didn't know you were this good, Ruth... As the TV show sig tune jingles signifying the end of the commercials, RUTH lets out a soft giggle. RUTH He doesn't stand a chance when he's this comfortable and focused... Right, David? DAVID does not respond; he's still caught in the cocoon of RUTH’S voice. AIMEE can only look on in fascinated silence as the scene fades to black.

Although its store presence is primarily in the UK and Ireland, the company has expanded internationally with a variety of store formats in various countries and also engages in international trade, importing goods from various global suppliers. As of my knowledge cutoff date in early 2023, Marks & Spencer has sourced products from various countries, and it is likely that they have at some point sourced products from or traded with suppliers in Chile, especially considering Chile's significant export industries such as wine, fresh fruit, and seafood, which may align with Marks & Spencer's product categories. However, their operations and sourcing strategies are subject to change and may have evolved over time. M&S has also had international stores and franchises in different regions, including Asia, the Middle East, and Europe, and sometimes in the Americas. However, their presence in Latin American countries has been limited compared to other regions. For specific and up-to-date information about M&S's current operations or trade relationships with Chile, it would be best to consult recent company reports or official statements from Marks & Spencer."},{"prompt":"Has Tesco operated or done international trade with Germany","completion":"As of my last update in early 2023, Tesco, the British multinational grocery and general merchandise retailer, has had various international ventures, including in several European countries. However, Tesco has not had a significant direct retail presence in Germany. Its international operations have been more prominent in countries such as Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia in Central Europe, and previously in Turkey and South Korea in Asia, among other locations, through wholly-owned stores, joint ventures, and franchises. In terms of international trade, it is common for large retailers like Tesco to source products globally, including from European countries. Germany, being one of the largest economies in Europe with a strong manufacturing sector, is a possible source for a variety of goods. Tesco may have traded with German suppliers for products ranging from food items to consumer goods to sell in its UK stores or in other international locations. Tesco's international strategy has evolved over the years, and the company has made significant changes to its overseas operations, including divestments from several international markets as part of its focus on core business and profitability. It is advisable to consult recent reports or announcements from Tesco for the latest information regarding their current operations or trade relationships with Germany."},{"prompt":"Has Tesco operated or done international trade with Sweeden","completion":"As of my last update in early 2023, Tesco has not had a significant direct retail presence in Sweden. The company's international operations have predominantly been concentrated in Central Europe and Asia, with a substantial presence in countries like the Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, and previously South Korea and Thailand before disposing of its operations in these Asian countries. However, in terms of international trade, it is quite typical for large international retailers like Tesco to engage in importing products from various countries, including Sweden. Sweden is known for a range of products that could be of interest to a retailer like Tesco, from food items to home and furniture goods. Tesco could source products from Swedish suppliers to be sold in its United Kingdom stores or other international locations where it operates. Swedish products that might be sourced by such international retailers include packaged food items, beverages, household items, and possibly even flat-pack furniture, considering Sweden is home to well-known global brands in these sectors. To verify current international trade relationships or to get specific details about potential operations or sourcing from Sweden, one would need to consult the latest reports, press releases, or statements from Tesco. Tesco, like many international retailers, regularly reviews its global sourcing strategies and market presence to adapt to changing consumer demands and competitive conditions."},{"prompt":"What potential markets has Marks and Spencer never ever operated or done international trading with them","completion":"As an AI with a knowledge cutoff in early 2023, I cannot provide real-time or future assessments, but I can highlight that Marks and Spencer's (M&S) international operations and trading relationships have historically been concentrated in certain regions and not others. Given the vast number of countries in the world and the varying levels of economic development, regulatory environments, and market potential, there are likely many countries where M&S has never established a retail presence or engaged in direct trading relationships. Potential markets where M&S may never have operated through physical stores, or perhaps not traded with directly, could include: 1. **Some Countries in Africa:** Apart from a few countries in North Africa and selected locations in Sub-Saharan Africa, many African nations may not have had M&S stores or direct trading relationships. 2. **Several Countries in Central Asia:** Countries in this region may not have been a focus for M&S's international expansion. 3. **Certain Countries in the Middle East and Central America:** While M&S has had a presence in some parts of the Middle East, there could be countries in these regions where it has not operated or traded. 4. **Isolated or Smaller Island Nations:** Small island nations, especially those with smaller economies and populations, may not be targeted by M&S for physical stores or direct trade. 5. **Countries with Complex Regulatory Environments:** Some countries with stringent trade restrictions or difficult business environments may not have been entered by M&S. It is important to note that M&S, like many retailers, often works with international suppliers to import goods. Therefore, even if M&S has not had physical stores in a particular country, it may still have indirect trading relationships by sourcing products from multinational suppliers who operate in those countries. The exact list of markets M&S has never traded with or operated in can be extensive and subject to change, as new markets could be entered or existing ones left, depending on strategic business decisions. For the most current information, one should consult M&S's latest business reports or company announcements."},{"prompt":"What potential countries has Marks and Spencer never ever operated or done international trading with them","completion":"As a global retailer, Marks and Spencer (M&S) has had a broad international presence through its stores and through the global sourcing of products. However, there are countries where M&S has not established physical stores or direct trading operations, for various reasons including market size, economic conditions, regulatory barriers, or strategic fit. Below are examples of countries or types of countries where M&S may never have directly operated or engaged in direct trading relationships: 1. **Countries in Conflict or with Significant Political Instability:** M&S, like many retailers, tends to avoid operating in countries where political instability or conflict could pose significant risks to employees, stores, and supply chains. 2. **Smaller or Less Developed Economies:** Countries with very small economies or lower levels of development that might not support a premium brand like M&S may not be attractive for physical store presence or direct trade. 3. **Isolated Markets:** Remote countries or those with import policies that are highly restrictive or protectionist might be bypassed by M&S in favor of markets with more open trade policies. 4. **Countries under International Sanctions:** Nations that are subject to international sanctions that restrict trade might be inaccessible for legal and ethical business operations. 5. **Markets with Low Brand Recognition or Demand:** Regions where there is limited awareness of the M&S brand or little demand for its products might not see direct trade or store operations by M&S. Specific examples could include some countries in sub-Saharan Africa (excluding South Africa where they have operated), parts of Central Asia, the Pacific islands, and perhaps certain countries in the Caribbean or Latin America. M&S's international focus has traditionally been stronger in Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and North America. It is important to understand that companies like M&S are constantly evaluating and re-evaluating market opportunities. This means that they might enter a new market or cease operations in an existing market based on ongoing assessments of potential profitability and strategic fit. Finally, sourcing of products can be indirect, through intermediaries or international suppliers, meaning that even if M&S doesn't directly trade with a country, it could still sell products that have materials or components from that country. For the most accurate and updated list of countries, one should check recent M&S financial reports, press releases, and other official communications from the company."},{"prompt":"What specific countries has Marks and Spencer never operated or done international trading with them and provide the names of the countries.","completion":"As an AI, I do not have access to a real-time database or the ability to provide a definitive list of specific countries with which Marks and Spencer (M&S) has never operated or traded directly. M&S has not publicly listed all the countries it has never operated in or traded with, and such a list would be extensive given the number of countries in the world. However, I can surmise that M&S, like most global retailers, must selectively choose markets based on strategic objectives, brand fit, and commercial viability. Certain regions and countries where M&S might not traditionally operate or trade with could include: Those where the political climate or economic conditions are not conducive to the brand's operations. Markets where the consumer base may not align with M&S’s product offerings or retail positioning. Recently established countries or those with small economies where there has not been significant demand for M&S products. Countries where market entry barriers may be too high or where trade restrictions limit the feasibility of operations. It's worth noting that while M&S may not directly operate stores or trade in every country, this does not imply a complete absence of their products there. M&S could indirectly reach various countries through online sales channels, international shipping, or by its products being carried by third parties. To get a specific and accurate list of countries M&S has never operated in or traded with directly, you would need access to detailed company records and supply chain data that aren't typically published in the public domain. You may consider reaching out to M&S directly for such specific inquiries, although it is unlikely that they provide a detailed list of countries they have never engaged with purely due to the operational nuances involved."},{"prompt":"What potential specific countries has Marks and Spencer never operated or done international trading with","completion":"As an AI with a knowledge cutoff date in early 2023, I cannot provide a comprehensive and up-to-date list of specific countries where Marks and Spencer (M&S) have never operated or engaged in international trading. M&S's global operations have been dynamic, with entry into new markets and withdrawal from others over time based on various business considerations. However, to give an illustrative idea, as of my last update, M&S may not have had a significant retail or direct trade presence in: - **Bhutan:** A secluded Himalayan nation with a focus on gross national happiness over economic metrics. - **Cuba:** Due to its unique political and economic system, Western businesses often face restrictions in operating here. - **Iraq:** Political instability and security concerns may deter many international retailers. - **Libya:** Similar to Iraq, ongoing conflict and instability make business operations difficult. - **North Korea:** The closed-off nature of the economy and stringent international sanctions limit Western businesses' presence. - **Somalia:** The lack of a stable government and ongoing conflict deter international business investments. - **Syria:** Civil conflict and international sanctions have hampered international business ventures. - **Venezuela:** Economic crises and political issues have made this market challenging for foreign businesses. These are speculative examples based on political, economic, or logistical factors that typically influence international business decisions. M&S concentrates its international efforts on markets where there is a strong fit for its brand and where it can operate effectively and profitably. Please note that while M&S may have chosen not to establish a physical presence in certain markets, it still may have indirect trading relationships with some of these countries through third-party manufacturers or as part of its global supply chain. Direct retail operations and sourcing are distinct aspects of a multinational company's international engagement, and having no retail presence doesn't necessarily mean there is no trading relationship in some form. For the latest and most accurate information, it would be necessary to consult M&S directly or review their most recent business reports and press releases."},{"prompt":"What potential countries could Marks and Spencer enter in order to operate in or do intetnational trading with them","completion":"Marks and Spencer (M&S) could consider entering new international markets based on a series of strategic, economic, and market-related factors. The following types of countries may present potential opportunities for M&S to either establish a retail presence or engage in international trade, subject to thorough market analysis and strategic fit: 1. **Emerging Economies with Growing Middle Class:** Countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, or the Philippines could provide growth opportunities as their middle classes expand and demand for quality international brands increases. 2. **Developed Countries with Strong Retail Sectors:** Though competitive, developed markets such as Sweden, Norway, or Switzerland might offer potential due to their high disposable incomes and consumer propensity to spend on quality goods. 3. **Countries Benefitting from Trade Agreements:** Nations that have recently entered trade agreements with the UK post-Brexit might be particularly attractive for international trade due to potentially lower tariffs and trade barriers. 4. **Countries with an Untapped Customer Base:** There may be countries with a cosmopolitan consumer base familiar with British brands but where M&S has not yet established a presence. For example, certain countries in Latin America or Central Europe could fit this criterion. 5. **Markets with Established Expat Communities:** Countries with significant British expatriate communities may present a compelling case for M&S, as there is often built-in brand recognition and demand among these consumers. 6. **E-Commerce Enabled Markets:** Countries with robust digital infrastructure and high internet penetration could be targeted for online sales as opposed to establishing physical stores. This approach could be beneficial in markets where commercial real estate is expensive or in countries like Japan or South Korea with tech-savvy consumers. Before entering any new market, M&S would need to conduct extensive market research and analysis to determine the viability of either setting up physical stores or initiating trade. Factors such as consumer spending habits, brand fit, local competition, legal and regulatory environment, supply chain logistics, economic stability, political climate, and cultural nuances are critical in deciding whether to enter a market. It's also important to note that retail is an ever-changing landscape with a shift towards online shopping, and M&S might consider strengthening its online presence in various potential markets without physical stores. M&S's strategy is likely to evolve over time, adapting to changes in consumer behavior and global trading conditions."},{"prompt":"Write a story about the following. I’m a guy in college. I have a skater style. I live in a dorm room. I have blonde messy hair and no facial hair and pierced ears. I have a male roommate with an extremely Italian look, hairstyle, and facial hair, and no piercings. One week he goes home to Italy. I stay in the dorm. Through a series of unfortunate events over the span of a day I end up looking like him and wearing his clothes. I didn’t intend for this and am very embarrassed. I get locked out of my dorm room so I can’t change myself back. His Italian friends who also attend our college spot me and assume I’m him and bring me along for their day and I end up spending the night in one of his male friend’s dorm rooms under the guise of being my roommate. I also have to imitate his accent and way of speaking and interests. Include all the above but have Marco dress like an extremely Italian man and have black hair and facial hair and have tan skin (vs my pale skin). Also have the series of unfortunate events be more elaborate and add more to change my hair color, give me facial hair, change my tan, put me in Marco’s signature scent, and cram me into Marco’s shoes. Do not make the basis of the unfortunate events me wanting to look italian","completion":"Title: A Day in Marco's Shoes Chapter 1: Accidental Transformation My name’s Tyler, a college sophomore with a penchant for skateboards and punk rock bands. My roommate, Marco? He’s like a walking, talking Italian brand - suave with his slicked-back black hair, a neat little goatee, always dressed to impress, and his piercing brown eyes resembled someone out of a Renaissance painting. He was the pinnacle of European flair, while I was more 'hit the beach at dawn, attend class if I wake up in time'. Life took a peculiar twist one Monday when Marco's grandmother fell ill—nothing too serious, but enough to send him hustling back to Italy for a week. With a friendly slap on the back and a \\"Ciao, bro,\\" he left me alone in the dorm. In less than 24 hours, my world would flip upside down. It started with spilling coffee on my white tee and only having Marco's fitted crimson polo unscathed in the room. Then, trying to fix my blonde, messy mop with hair product I grabbed blindly, it darkened considerably, reacting absurdly to whatever that Italian concoction was. My sketchy attempt at a hair flip turned into a sleek back nearly identical to Marco's. While fiddling with hair gel, my earring snagged on my sleeve, tearing through - the pain was searing. I sought refuge in the restroom, where a splash of water from the leaky faucet sprayed directly onto my chinos. It was just my luck that the only pants available were Marco's tailored slacks. Chapter 2: An Unanticipated Masquerade As if things couldn't get worse, I stumbled into a campus event in the art department - amateur henna tattoo artistry. Before I knew what was happening, a girl insisted on using my face for a demonstration, drawing a goatee perfectly mirroring Marco's. Of course, it was not to wash off for weeks. A desperate trip to return to the sanctuary of my dorm room ended in disaster as I realized my keys were missing. Frantically checking pockets, I found a vial of cologne - Marco's signature scent. In a fidgety reflex, I drenched myself. I was now a close smelly replica of my roommate. Then came the shoes. Those cursed Italian leather shoes Marco treated like gold. They were a size too small for me, but in my panic to find my keys, I jammed my feet into them anyway. Limping down the hallway with my belongings, minus the keys, I looked nothing like myself. Chapter 3: The Impromptu Role That's when I was recognized, or rather, misrecognized. Marco's friends, a vibrant group of Italian exchange students, spotted me. \\"Marco!\\" they cheered, none the wiser. I tried to protest, but they whisked me away, chatting about the Calcio game last night and their plans for pizza. Surviving the day was a matter of nodding and throwing in an occasional \\"Sì\\" or \\"Certo\\". The Italian accent I attempted was something of a cross between a bad gangster movie and a pasta commercial, but they bought it. Marco's life was now mine, complete with soccer trivia and debates over the best way to cook pasta al dente. Chapter 4: An Uncomfortable Evening Nightfall didn't bring relief. Stuck in Marco's persona, I was compelled to follow the gang, all the way into one of their dorm rooms. They continued with their lively conversations in rapid Italian, filled with gesticulations and passionate exclamations. I was stuck, trying to keep up, praying for sleep and the end of this peculiar nightmare. The bed I was to sleep on was foreign, the night was long and uncomfortable. Laying in the darkness, I thought about how a day could go so astonishingly wrong and how I'd never have guessed I'd spend the night living a life that was so emphatically not mine. Chapter 5: Dawn of Truth The following morning, Marco’s friends had left early for class, and I had a chance to limp back to my own room. Our RA had a master key and let me in, eyeing me skeptically as I stumbled past him. When I finally looked into the mirror, the reflection solidified the ridiculousness of the past day. Marco returned later, to find his room a mess and his roommate with an inexplicable Italianate appearance. Explaining everything was as painful as the cramps in my feet from his shoes. That was the day I learned valuable life lessons: never use unidentified hair products, always carry spare keys, and under no circumstances ever sleep in another man’s bed, especially if his name is Marco and his Italian entourage can't tell the difference."},{"prompt":"Write the story again but flip the roles so Marco accidentally comes to look like me while I'm away","completion":"Title: Marco's Misadventures Chapter 1: Start of an Unlikely Fiasco While I, the resident skateboard dude with tossed blonde hair and pierced ears, was away visiting family, my roommate Marco found himself in a string of odd happenings that would leave him unrecognizable: a textbook case of mistaken identity, but with a twist. Marco, typically styled with slicked-back hair and a sharp Italian wardrobe, had no clue his week would take such a bizarre turn. It kicked off with a prank. One of our mischievous hall mates decided it'd be hilarious to temporarily dye Marco's jet black locks with a washable blonde hair paint during a dormitory event. Initially furious, Marco's anger subsided when he was assured it'd easily wash out. However, when Marco attempted to fix the aberrant color, things escalated. He grabbed my beloved sea-salt spray, assuming it was a styling product. To his dismay, it only made his hair texturize and puff out into a perfect imitation of my surf-rider styled mess. Chapter 2: Unwilling Transformation After the hair debacle, a shirt altercation ensued. While performing a lab experiment, Marco accidentally splashed chemicals on his fitted shirt and had no choice but to borrow one of my band tees lying around. The loose, graphic nature couldn't have clashed more with his typical clean-cut look. Moving swiftly on from the shirt mishap, he decided a shower would improve his day. Little did he know that his own shower gel was out, and thus, he unwittingly used my sandalwood-scented body wash. It was a scent distinctly mine - earthy, far from Marco's usual citrus-infused essence. Now, even his aroma screamed ‘me’. With his regular slacks irreparably stained in the lab incident, the only trousers he found were my ripped jeans, a bit long and baggy for his taste. Marco, now the epitome of casual, unwittingly imitated my typical campus style. Chapter 3: Complications and Confusions Next, the shoelaces of Marco’s shoes gave way, and he impulsively slid into my beat-up sneakers without a second thought. A pair of faux glasses left on the desk, props for one of my art projects, found their way onto his face. He looked in the mirror and barely recognized the man staring back. The final touch in Marco's transformation was entirely accidental. While lounging on the grass, he took off the borrowed sunglasses and fell asleep, not realizing that the afternoon sun was potent enough to eliminate his perfect tan lines, aligning with mine — a full-faced sun-kissed glow instead of his usual tan with contrasting pale areas around the eyes. Chapter 4: One in the Same Heading to the dining hall for dinner, Marco stumbled into a group of skaters from my usual crew. With the setting sun in their eyes and his new disheveled look, they hollered, \\"Hey, buddy! You're back early!\\" Unaware of my absence, they clapped him on the back, initiating him into my world of half-pipes and punk rock jargon. Hesitant at first, a series of nods and shrugs got Marco through the evening as he unintentionally masqueraded as me. He even found himself defending my not-so-great skateboarding skills. His new persona was inadvertently convincing. Chapter 5: Living the Double Life Much like my own ordeal, Marco's night was spent amongst people who thought he was someone else. As they joked and talked about recent skate tricks and local bands, Marco’s slip-ups were shrugged off as post-travel tiredness. He spent the night in a bunk at the skater’s pad, the sleep short and restless. Come morning, with me expected to return shortly, Marco sprinted back to our dorm utilizing a back route to avoid any more encounters. Our surprised RA unlocked the door to reveal Marco's uncanny reflection in the mirror: the skater roommate. He showered multiple times, attempting to scrub away the sandy appeal and remove the temporary color. Donning his classic Italian attire, he was back to his Euro-chic self just in time for my arrival. With wild stories to swap, we laughed at the improbable odds of us swapping styles without intent. A new bond formed, one where Marco understood the life of his skate-loving roommate, and I had a taste of being Italian for a day."},{"prompt":"You are a UK scriptwriter with a talent for natural, uncliched dialogue and a deep knowledge of hypnosis inductions.

Here are several tips on how to reduce mold in your living environment: 1. **Control Humidity Levels**: - Keep indoor humidity low, ideally between 30-50%. You can use dehumidifiers to help achieve this, especially in damp areas like basements. - Use an air conditioner during humid seasons. - Ensure that your home is well-insulated and ventilated. 2. **Improve Ventilation**: - Use exhaust fans in bathrooms, kitchens, and laundry rooms to vent moisture-laden air outside. - Open windows to increase air circulation when weather permits. 3. **Fix Leaks Promptly**: - Repair any leaking roofs, walls, or pipes in your home to prevent moisture from seeping in and providing a ripe environment for mold. - Ensure your gutters and drainage systems are clean and functioning properly to direct water away from your home. 4. **Dry Wet Areas Immediately**: - Wipe up spills and dry out wet areas within 24-48 hours to prevent mold growth. - Don't leave wet clothes in the washing machine or laundry basket. - Make sure to dry the floor and walls after a bath or shower. 5. **Clean and maintain your HVAC system**: - Regularly clean vents and air ducts. - Replace filters as recommended by the manufacturer. 6. **Use Mold-Resistant Products**: - When doing any renovations, consider using mold-resistant drywall or mold inhibitors for paints. - Select mold-resistant building materials, especially for areas prone to wetness. 7. **Keep Areas Clean and Free of Clutter**: - Mold can grow on dust, so regular cleaning is important. - Clutter can prevent airflow and create moist pockets, so keep areas tidy. 8. **Monitor and Use Proper Drainage**: - Ensure water from your home flows away from the foundation to prevent pooling and seepage. - Slope the ground away from your home’s foundation. 9. **Remove and Replace Moldy Materials**: - Sometimes the only way to properly deal with mold is to remove and replace mold-infested materials, especially if they absorb water, like carpeting or ceiling tiles. 10. **Use Mold-Killing Products in Bathrooms**: - Clean bathrooms with mold-killing products. Do not use carpeting in bathrooms and basements. 11. **Inspect and Seal Points of Outside Entry**: - Keep windows and door seals in good repair. - Seal around utility pipes or vents that could allow outside moisture to enter walls. 12. **Consider Air Purifiers**: - Air purifiers with HEPA filters can capture spores from the air. - Use in damp and musty areas, like basements, if necessary. Remember that mold spores are always present in the air, so the key to controlling mold growth is controlling moisture. If you are frequently battling mold in your home, it might be worth it to consult with a professional to identify potential structural issues that might be contributing to excess moisture."},{"prompt":"clothing","completion":"If you're asking about how to prevent mold on clothing, here are some tips that might help: 1. **Keep Clothes Dry**: Always dry clothing thoroughly before storing them. If you've been caught in the rain or sweated heavily, make sure these clothes are dried immediately rather than left in a wet pile. 2. **Proper Ventilation**: Ensure your wardrobe or place where you store clothes is well-ventilated. Airflow can greatly reduce the potential for mold growth. 3. **Use Dehumidifiers or Silica Gel**: In humid climates, using a dehumidifier in your home or placing silica gel packets in your drawers and closets can help absorb moisture and keep clothing dry. 4. **Avoid Damp Walls**: Do not place your wardrobe or clothes against damp walls as this can cause moisture to transfer to the clothes and encourage mold growth. 5. **Use Anti-Mold Sprays**: There are anti-mold sprays available that can be applied to clothing to inhibit mold growth. Make sure to use these as directed and only on appropriate fabrics. 6. **Clean Clothes Regularly**: Regular laundering can prevent the build-up of mold spores in the fabric. This includes outerwear and items that are not washed as often as regular clothes. 7. **Sunlight**: Sun drying your clothes can be very effective in killing mold spores. If possible, hang clothes in direct sunlight to dry. 8. **Avoid Storing Wet Clothes**: Never store clothes when they are damp. Gym clothes, swimwear, and towels should be dried immediately after use. 9. **Use Vinegar**: Adding a cup of white vinegar to the washing machine during the rinse cycle can help kill any potential mold spores. Be sure to check if the fabric can handle vinegar to avoid damage. 10. **Store with Care**: Use breathable fabric covers or storage solutions for clothes that are being stored for long periods. Avoid plastic bags and airtight containers. 11. **Check Regularly**: Especially if you live in a humid climate, it’s a good idea to check stored clothes regularly for signs of mold or a musty smell. 12. **Dry Clean Sensitive Items**: If you have clothing that cannot be washed regularly (such as certain types of formal wear), consider dry cleaning them occasionally to remove any mold spores. 13. **Maintenance**: If you store clothes in a basement or other potentially damp areas, make sure to keep these spaces dry with the use of dehumidifiers and consider installing a hygrometer to monitor the humidity level. By following these tips, you can significantly reduce the chances of mold growing on your clothing. If you encounter mold on fabric, address it promptly by washing with hot water and detergent, or dry cleaning if the fabric requires it. For persistent or heavy mold, it may be wiser to discard the affected items to prevent the spread of mold spores."},{"prompt":"Write me a narrative of Chris vs Korvo Roth, Raven's brother in a tournament.
