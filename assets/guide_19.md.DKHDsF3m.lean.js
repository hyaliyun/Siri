They claim value investors have lost the plot, dogmatically clinging to dying businesses as the world passes them by. Few are listening to the faint objections of value investors, buried in the depths of a thirteen-year drawdown. We have spent a lot of time thinking about the future of value investing. Ultimately, while we do not believe value is dead - Ben Graham‚Äôs framework of buying stocks below intrinsic value is both timeless and sensible - we do believe that his metrics for intrinsic value need to be updated. Graham established the principles of value investing in the days of railroads and steel mills, when intrinsic value was almost fully tangible. However, over the past century, the economy has transformed from industrial to informationbased. Today‚Äôs dominant firms build moats using not physical but intangible assets, such as intellectual property, brand equity, human capital, and network effects. Value investors should adapt by expanding their definition of intrinsic value to include not just tangible but also intangible value. Intrinsic Value = Tangible Value + Intangible Value While simple in theory, quantifying intangibles is actually challenging as we cannot rely on standardized accounting statements. While alternative data can provide valuable insight, they tend to require special tools to process. Over the past year, we have written several research papers using machine learning to quantify specific aspects of the intangible economy. This paper consolidates this sprawling research into a single firm-level measure of intangible value. We will show that a value strategy that incorporates this intangible value measure alongside traditional metrics (e.g., Fama-French) would have avoided value‚Äôs recent travails. Exhibit 1 Value Is Dead, Long Live Value! ‚úä Source: Ken French, Sparkline. Tangible Value is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of U.S. equities on book value / market value, market cap weighted (per Fama-French). Intangible Value is the same except it uses our intangible-adjusted intrinsic value metric. We exclude transaction and financing costs for comparability to Fama-French. From 12/31/1959 to 4/30/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. The Hero‚Äôs Journey Adventures of the Oracle Before we get into the construction of this intangible value factor, we want to tell a story. In this case, it is the story of Warren Buffett, the 90-year old paragon of value investing, who has evolved his investment style over his long career with the changing economy. Buffett began his illustrious career as a direct disciple of Ben Graham. The father of value investing, Graham was active in the industrial age, when intrinsic value was synonymous with tangible book value. Security analysis came down to assessing the value of a company‚Äôs hard assets and buying firms priced below liquidation value. 1 June 2021 Kai Wu Founder & Chief Investment Officer <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_EMAIL_ADDRESS> Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Buffett was a great student and achieved success in applying his mentor‚Äôs framework. He called it ‚Äúcigar-butt investing,‚Äù buying mediocre companies at bargain prices for that one last puff. Berkshire Hathaway, originally a struggling textile mill, is a perfect illustration. However, with the help of his business partner, Charlie Munger, Buffett gradually evolved his style to instead focus on ‚Äúwonderful businesses at fair prices.‚Äù This coincided with the rise of the great American consumer brands, such as Coca-Cola. Buffett bought Coke not because of its tangible assets (it has very little), but because of its wide intangible moats - its strong brand and management (human capital). But his journey was not yet done. In 2016, after eschewing technology stocks for decades, Buffett made a massive investment in Apple. After delivering a whopping 65 billion profit, Apple now comprises 20% of Berkshire‚Äôs entire value. Buffett has called it the ‚Äúbest business I know in the world‚Äù due not only to its technological superiority but even more so to the value of its ‚Äúecosystem‚Äù (network effects). Exhibit 2 The Hero‚Äôs Journey Source: Sparkline The Asset-Light Economy Buffett explicitly recognized that the economy had greatly transformed since the days of his mentor, saying: ‚ÄúThe four largest companies today by market value do not need any net tangible assets. They are not like AT&T, GM, or Exxon Mobil, requiring lots of capital to produce earnings. We have become an asset-light economy.\\" In the 1930s, the dominant industries were asset-heavy railroads, autos, oil, utilities, chemicals and steel. Today, the most important industries are asset-light. As seen below, the percentage of U.S. public company market capitalization in high-intangible industries has grown from around 0% to 50% over the past century. Exhibit 3 The Asset-Light Economy Source: Ken French, Sparkline. We manually divide SIC industries into 9 intangible industries (hardware, software, chips, drugs, medeq, labeq, hlth, bussv, persv) and 40 tangible industries (e.g., transportation, oil, steel, autos, chems, utilities, banks, retail, telecom, household). As of 4/30/2021. Importantly, Buffett recognized that this economic shift necessitated an expansion of the definition of intrinsic value beyond hard assets. Over the years, Buffett has accumulated several intangible ‚Äúmoats,‚Äù which he has added to Graham‚Äôs framework alongside tangible value. üè∞ Exhibit 4 Four Intangible Moats Source: Sparkline Intangible assets are quickly becoming the primary form of economic value. Firms with loyal customers, top talent, innovative products, and network effects are increasingly 2 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 dominating economic activity. In Investing in the Intangible Economy (Oct 2020), we conducted an in-depth analysis of the rising role of intangibles. We showed the following chart, which provides a (conservative) bottoms-up estimate of the contribution of intangibles to the capital stock of U.S. public companies. Exhibit 5 Can‚Äôt Touch This üî® Source: S&P, Sparkline. As of 2019. Intangibles currently comprise roughly half of the corporate balance sheet. More importantly, this ratio is very likely to expand further in the future. Hard assets will become increasingly irrelevant as ‚Äúintangibles eat the world.‚Äù Expanding Intrinsic Value Let‚Äôs return to our original equation: Intrinsic Value = Tangible Value + Intangible Value In the days of Ben Graham, the final term in this equation was a mere rounding error. Intrinsic value and tangible value were functionally equivalent. However, as we‚Äôve seen, intangible value is a significant and growing part of the economy and can no longer be ignored. We highly doubt that Graham intended value investors to so strictly adhere to the specific metrics used in his books. The lessons are in his frameworks and mental models. As the world shifts from railroads to airplanes to flying cars, the principles of value investing will always hold. The intelligent investor is one with the mental dexterity to apply these frameworks to the changing problems of his day. Quest for Intangible Value Challenge Accepted Buffett is not the only famous value investor to recognize the rising role of intangibles. In a recent letter, Howard Marks wrote: ‚ÄúValue investing doesn‚Äôt have to be about low valuation metrics. Value can be found in many forms. The fact that a company grows rapidly, relies on intangibles such as technology for its success and/or has a high p/e ratio shouldn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt be invested in on the basis of intrinsic value. Many sources of potential value can‚Äôt be reduced to a number. As Albert Einstein purportedly said, ‚ÄòNot everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.‚Äô The fact that something can‚Äôt be predicted with precision doesn‚Äôt mean it isn‚Äôt real.‚Äù Like us, Marks argues for a more expansive definition of intrinsic value. He correctly urges investors not to conflate value investing with low price-to-earnings ratios. Such backward-looking metrics largely ignore the mostly future value of intangible investment (e.g., R&D). Moreover, Marks urges investors not to ignore important sources of value just because they cannot be measured precisely. We will take up this challenge. We will show that intangible value can indeed be quantified, albeit requiring the use of non-traditional data and a little bit of machine learning wizardry. üßô The End of Accounting ‚ÄúThe constant rise in the importance of intangibles in companies‚Äô performance and value creation, yet suppressed by accounting and reporting practices, renders financial information increasingly irrelevant.‚Äù - Baruch Lev and Feng Gu, The End of Accounting (2016) The first stop in our quest to quantify intangible value will be financial statements. GAAP accounting provides a consistent and structured way for companies to report their financials over time. The problem is that accounting principles were originally developed centuries ago and have remained mostly unchanged despite the rise of the modern economy. 3 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 The use of centuries-old accounting principles to evaluate intangible-rich companies like Apple cannot be expected to produce great results. Lev and Gu show that metrics like book value and reported earnings have been steadily losing explanatory power (at a rate of 6 percentage points per decade). This is quite concerning as book value and earnings anchor two widely used valuation ratios (i.e., P/E and P/B). Exhibit 6 The End of Accounting Source: Lev and Gu (2016), Sparkline. Metric is the adjusted R-squared of a regression of market value on reported earnings and book value. As of 2013. The table below shows how GAAP accounting treats each of the four intangible pillars (or doesn‚Äôt, as is often the case). Exhibit 7 GAAPs in Intangible Coverage Source: Sparkline Financial statements‚Äô reporting on intangible assets is extremely inadequate, providing minimal and inconsistent coverage of even basic intangible metrics such as employee retention, relationships with external partners, innovative activity, and brand investment. The only potentially helpful accounting data on intangibles are R&D and SG&A expenditures. SG&A is a catchall that includes marketing, sales, personnel, and other overhead costs not directly tied to goods sold. Lev and Gu advocate capitalizing R&D and a portion of SG&A. This allows us to create a balance sheet asset for this intangible investment, which would otherwise be punitively deducted from annual net income as an expense per current practice. However, as we will later show, while sensible, this does not materially improve the performance of value investing in practice. We believe this is due to the weak relationship between input cost and output value for intangible investment. The goal of accounting is to capture ‚Äúhistoric cost.‚Äù However, the ex-post value of intangible investment is extremely uncertain. A 10 million research project can be worth 1 billion or 0; an ad campaign can go viral or flop; a top engineering hire can be 10-100 times more productive than a median one; and network effect feedback loops can be either virtuous or vicious. The upshot is that we need to move beyond the limited information in financial statements. We need to find ways to directly quantify the value of intangible assets, opposed to just the historical costs of their creation. The Dark Matter of Finance üîÆ The information economy has driven a steep decline in the relevance of tangible assets. In their place, we have intangible assets. We like to call intangibles the ‚Äúdark matter of finance,‚Äù for while intangible matter holds the financial universe together, it is not visible to the naked eye. Fortunately, the digital age has also triggered an explosion of new data and tools, enabling us to start exploring this brave new world üî≠ . Data is growing at an exponential rate, doubling every year or two. However, most of this new data is unstructured, taking the form of text, images or audio. Unstructured data is large, high-dimensional, noisy, and generally not amenable to traditional statistical techniques. 4 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Exhibit 8 Unstructured Data Is Eating the World Source: IDC, IBM This is where machine learning comes into play. In Deep Learning in Investing (Jul 2020), we discuss how recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) give us the ability to make sense of unstructured text data. We reproduce the exhibit below to highlight the massive growth in NLP models over the past few years. Exhibit 9 NLP üöÄ Source: Sparkline (adapted from HuggingFace). As of July 2020. There are troves of valuable information about companies‚Äô intangible assets buried in the vast ocean of unstructured data. Unlike financial statements, this data is scattered across dozens of sources and cannot be extracted with standard tools. However, this is arguably a good thing. It is unlikely that much alpha can be found in tangible value, given that any halfway decent quant can spin up a price-to-book strategy given Compustat, an EC2 box, and a few hours without checking Twitter. The Artificial Intelligent Investor Over the past year, we‚Äôve done a series of deep dives into specific intangible assets. We now seek to operationalize this research by building a single cohesive measure of firm-level intangible value, which we can then use to build an intangible-aware value strategy. All these papers are freely available in the research section of our website, so rather than repeat the rationale for each analysis, we will merely focus on collation. More specifically, we aim to organize the dozens of disparate research threads into a handful of major themes. We‚Äôll conduct this clustering analysis using a NLP technique called topic modeling. First, we split the papers into smaller sections. Second, we run a topic model over these paper-sections to identify salient themes. Finally, we use an ML algorithm called TSNE for visualization. Exhibit 10 Research Map üó∫ Source: Sparkline The sections naturally fall into nine broad themes. The most central clusters form around the four intangible pillars: innovation, human capital, brands, and network effects. Five other research topics radiate out from this core. These five research branches center on the concepts of intangibles, monopolies, value investing, NLP, and machine learning. These papers contain dozens of actionable ways to quantify intangibles such as disruptive innovation, workforce quality, patent value, and hiring pull. We will build a composite measure of intangible value that combines these individual 5 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 metrics. However, please note that the composite will also include many metrics not described in the papers above. Our research efforts produce more ideas than we can write about. We build the composite in two steps. Before we build the full composite, we first assign each metric to one of the five pillars. We then average the metrics at the pillar level to produce five sub-scores. Since any individual metric can be quite noisy, combining many metrics helps produce a more robust valuation. From here, the composite value score is simply the sum of the scores of each of the five pillars. This intermediate step helps us deal with the correlation structure of individual metrics. For example, an AI-intensive firm may display its AI prowess in the form of having many AI patents and AI-skilled employees (compared to its market cap). However, since these two metrics are correlated, they should be used in concert to triangulate the underlying idea of innovativeness. Importantly, most of these metrics are scaled by price. Thus, they do not measure the total quantity of intangibles owned by a firm but instead quantify the share of intangibles we obtain by buying a fixed dollar amount of the firm‚Äôs equity. For example, we don‚Äôt care about how many total patents IBM has, but rather how many patents we obtain per dollar invested in IBM. Think of it like the ‚Äúdividend yield,‚Äù except that instead of buying dividends, we buy patents. Value investing is all about getting value for your money. Traditional valuation ratios measure the quantity of tangible assets obtained for a given dollar of investment. Our metrics are conceptually identical, except they focus on intangible sources of value (e.g., # patents, # PhD employees, brand equity per dollar invested). Our hope is that this metric helps us find efficient ways to obtain intangible assets. Intangible Value Setting the Table üçΩ üßÇ Now that you‚Äôve seen how the sausage is made, it‚Äôs time to eat! Remember that all this work was done in order to create a measure of intrinsic value that includes both tangible and intangible value. To whet our appetite, let‚Äôs start by sampling some of the companies that are strong on each of the intangible pillars. Exhibit 11 Notable Intangible Companies Source: Sparkline While anecdotal, these examples are quite intuitive. Firms like Nvidia and Moderna invest heavily in innovation; Nike and Harley in brand; Google and Goldman in talent; and Uber and Twitter in creating network effects. For our second course, we‚Äôll drill down even further. The next exhibit decomposes four well-known companies‚Äô balance sheets into the five tangible and intangible pillars. Exhibit 12 Balance Sheet Decomposition Source: Sparkline. As of 5/28/2021. First, we see that Boeing‚Äôs value is primarily derived from its intellectual property; it has invested over 100 billion in R&D since its inception. In contrast, Boeing has no tangible value; 6 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 in fact, it even has slightly negative tangible book value due to an accounting quirk with share buybacks. Like Boeing, Google and Coca-Cola are asset-light firms. However, unlike Boeing, Coke‚Äôs value lies not in its IP but its brand. Since inception, Coke invested a comparable 100 billion in building intangible value. However, this investment was in advertising rather than research. Meanwhile, Google enjoys a nice diversified mix of intangibles. At the other extreme, the insurance company Aflac is mostly composed of tangible assets. ü¶Ü By now, you‚Äôve probably noticed a strong industry effect. The next exhibit performs the same decomposition but at the aggregate sector level. Exhibit 13 Sector Balance Sheet Decomposition Source: Sparkline. As of 5/28/2021. Tangible value is most important for real estate, utilities, materials, energy, and financials. However, it comprises less than half of total value in six of the 11 sectors. Moreover, these six intangible-rich sectors dominate the stock market, comprising over 80% of S&P 500 market capitalization. Of the intangible assets, intellectual property is the most important for tech and healthcare; human capital is critical for not only tech and healthcare, but also communications and financials; brand equity drives the most value in consumer discretionary and staples; and network effects matter most for communications and technology. The Death of (Tangible) Value Our hypothesis is that value investing has struggled due to the rise of intangible assets. Now that we have a quantitative measure of intangible value for each company, we can test this empirically. We will first divide our investment universe into two groups: intangible-rich companies (top quartile on intangible share) and everyone else. From here, we can run a traditional value investing strategy in each universe separately. The next exhibit shows that tangible value has continued to work reasonably well, as long as you avoid running it on high intangible companies. Not surprisingly, tangible value has been an ineffective tool for evaluating firms composed mainly of intangible assets. A classic case of trying to fit a square peg into a round hole! Exhibit 14 Old Value in the New Economy Source: S&P, Sparkline. Blue line is performance of the traditional value factor in a universe consisting of the top quartile of the top 1000 largest U.S. firms on intangible share. Red line is the same but in a universe of all other stocks. The traditional value factor is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quartiles of stocks on price to book, earnings, sales, and cash flow (both trailing and expected). We exclude transaction and financing costs. From 12/31/1994 to 5/28/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. In Value Investing Is Short Tech Disruption (Aug 2020), we argued that value investors have struggled due to an implicit (losing) bet against disruptive technology. We now see that the ‚Äúshort disruption‚Äù bet is part of a broader bet against intangibles in general (of which innovation is but one pillar). 7 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 The good news is that traditional value investing still works as long as you only invest in companies for which tangible value still matters. The bad news is that the universe of companies for which tangible value still matters is steadily and irrevocably shrinking! Fixing Fama-French Of course, there‚Äôs no reason to restrict ourselves to tangible value when we now have a metric that also includes intangible value. If built correctly, our intangible-aware intrinsic value metric should be able to find cheap stocks in both high- and low-intangible universes. Our first step is to define a baseline ‚ÄúTangible Value‚Äù factor. We use the value factor defined by Fama and French, given the paper‚Äôs lofty status as the canonical academic work on quantitative value. Fama and French use book value as their measure of intrinsic value. They build a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of stocks on price-to-book. We use the market cap weighted version of their strategy to reduce the risk of deceptive results from illiquid small-caps. Exhibit 15 You Hate to See It üôà Source: Ken French, Sparkline. Tangible Value is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of U.S. equities on book value / market value, market cap weighted (per Fama-French). Fama and French exclude transaction and financing costs. From 12/31/1959 to 4/30/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. The historical performance of Tangible Value reflects the tribulations of many value managers. After many decades of consistent outperformance of +5.4% annualized, Tangible Value has floundered over the past decade. Even after the rebound from the recent Covid-reopening rally, it would have to climb a further +280% to get back to trend. Now that we have established a baseline, we next want to evaluate the impact of augmenting this baseline with a measure of intangible value. We will test two different approaches to quantifying intangibles. First, we build a ‚ÄúGAAP Intangible Value‚Äù factor that augments book value by adding intangibles derived from capitalizing R&D and a portion of SG&A found in GAAP income statements (per Lev and Gu). Second, we create an ‚ÄúIntangible Value‚Äù factor that uses our definition of intrinsic value that includes both tangible and intangible value. Importantly, this factor goes beyond accounting data to use measures of intangibles extracted from unstructured data using NLP. The next exhibit focuses on the past decade, which is the period during which traditional value has struggled. We find that GAAP-derived intangible assets were only marginally helpful. The real improvement comes once we unlock the power of non-accounting, unstructured data. Exhibit 16 Intangible Improvements Source: Ken French, Sparkline. Tangible Value is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of U.S. equities on book value / market value, market cap weighted (per Fama-French). GAAP Intangible Value is the same except it adds capitalized R&D and SG&A to book value. Intangible Value is the same except it uses our intangible-adjusted intrinsic value metric. We exclude transaction and financing costs for comparability to Fama and French. From 12/31/2009 to 4/30/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. 8 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Finally, let‚Äôs put it all together. We find that, while Tangible Value has decayed with the declining relevance of tangible assets, Intangible Value has continued to perform in line with value‚Äôs long-term historical trend. Exhibit 17 O Drawdown, Where Art Thou? Source: Ken French, Sparkline. Tangible Value is a long-short portfolio of the top and bottom quintiles of U.S. equities on book value / market value, market cap weighted (per Fama-French). Intangible Value is the same except it uses our intangible-adjusted intrinsic value metric. We exclude transaction and financing costs for comparability to Fama-French. From 12/31/1959 to 4/30/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. Dissecting the Portfolio The previous section analyzed the performance of the ‚Äúvalue factor,‚Äù which is a long-short strategy. We‚Äôll now examine a long-only version. This is basically just the long side of the Intangible Value factor with a few modifications. We start with the U.S. large- and mid-cap investment universe (roughly the Russell 1000). We rank each stock on our intangible-augmented value score and buy the cheapest 150 stocks. Within these stocks, we allocate more weight to stocks with higher scores and, to increase portfolio liquidity, market capitalization. For ease of exposition, we will call this the Intangible Value ‚Äúportfolio‚Äù (opposed to ‚Äúfactor‚Äù). The next exhibit shows the top ten holdings of the Intangible Value portfolio. For context, we also include stocks in the top ten of the S&P 500 but not in the Intangible Value portfolio. Exhibit 18 Top Holdings Source: S&P, Russell, Sparkline. Weights are percentages. As of 5/28/2021. At first blush, the very top of the portfolio doesn‚Äôt look too exciting. This is due in large part to the unique situation today where the largest companies also happen to be among the most intangible-rich. As discussed in The Platform Economy (Dec 2020), firms like Google, Microsoft and Amazon are digital monopolies that use intangibles to create wide moats, enabling them to sustain high growth rates at a historically unprecedented scale. That said, we still notice some important differences, especially compared to Russell 1000 Value and Growth. Value has nearly zero exposure to Big Tech, while Growth has a massive 36% position. Further, the Intangible Value portfolio does not have any Tesla or Visa or Berkshire, J&J, or JPMorgan, although they are among the largest holdings of these three indices. As you go down to the bottom 140 positions, the names and, more importantly, weights diverge further. Rather than show all positions, we will analyze the portfolio on the aggregate dimensions of industry and style factors. We will first look at industry group exposure. 9 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Exhibit 19 Industry Exposure Source: S&P, Russell, Sparkline. Weights are percentages. The blue text highlights the top 5 industry groups for each portfolio. As of 5/28/2021. The Intangible Value portfolio has a large allocation to the stocks most central to the modern knowledge economy: software, hardware, pharma, media and semiconductors. In contrast, traditional value has a hard time bringing itself to buy companies composed of intangible assets. This results in a portfolio concentrated in old-economy industries such as capital goods, banks, and financials. We will next break out the factor lens üîç . We calculate the aggregate exposure of each portfolio to both traditional ‚Äústyle factors‚Äù and custom intangible factors. Exhibit 20 Factor Exposure Source: S&P, Russell, USPTO, Sparkline. Earnings, book, sales, R&D, S&M, and patents are calculated over a trailing 12-month window. Patents and PhDs are scaled by billions (e.g., # patents per 1 billion market cap). Patents are from USPTO. S&M is sales and marketing expenditures. Platforms are based on metric defined in The Platform Economy (Dec 2020). Expected Growth is consensus analyst expected long-term growth of earnings per share. All calculations are weighted averages with weights equal to portfolio position size. As of 5/28/2021. On traditional metrics (i.e., size, value, growth, profitability), the Intangible Value portfolio has a profile similar to the S&P 500 and between that of traditional value and growth. However, it has a much greater exposure to intangible assets. Each dollar invested in the Intangible Value portfolio buys around twice the quantity of R&D, marketing, patents and PhDs compared to a dollar invested in the S&P 500. While this is somewhat by design, it is useful to see that this advantage doesn‚Äôt come at the cost of materially worse valuation ratios, growth or profitability. Finally, we backtest the performance again to make sure nothing was lost in translation from the long-short factor. This time we‚Äôll add simulated transaction costs and 50 bps of fees and expenses to make the backtest more realistic. Exhibit 21 Intangible Value Source: S&P, Russell, Sparkline. Intangible Value is a long-only portfolio of the top 150 stocks from within the top 1000 U.S. stocks on intangible value score, weighted by score and modified market cap. We simulate transaction costs and include 50 bps of fees and expenses. S&P 500, Russell 1000 Value, and Russell 1000 Growth are (uninvestable) index returns. From 12/31/1994 to 5/28/2021. See important backtest disclosure below. We find that the Intangible Value portfolio would have outperformed the S&P 500. Interestingly, despite currently having factor exposures in between those of Russell 1000 Value and Growth, it would have also outperformed both. 10 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Think Outside the Style Box üì¶ Style Boxed In As quantitative managers, we have benefited professionally from the rising tide of factor-based investing. However, we believe that the ‚Äúfactorization‚Äù of the investment industry has at this point reached an excessive level and is now actually contributing to its stagnation. As the investment industry has become institutionalized, active managers have been forced into so-called ‚Äústyle boxes.‚Äù Popularized by Morningstar, this framework divides the world into a two-dimensional matrix based on value vs. growth and large vs. small cap. Exhibit 22 Style Boxes Source: Morningstar, Sparkline The style box framework defines value and growth as diametric opposites. According to this framework, in the same way that a stock can‚Äôt be both small and large, it can‚Äôt be both value and growth. Managers are expected to pick an allegiance to one box and only one box. Traitors who step out of their lane are summarily fired for ‚Äústyle drift!‚Äù ‚ò†Ô∏è Joined at the Hip We believe that the style box orthodoxy has shackled managers to an obsolete formulation of value and stifled attempts to expand the definition of value to that which is relevant today. In fact, we are not alone in this thinking. Warren Buffett addressed this topic decisively: ‚Äú... there is no such thing as growth stocks or value stocks, the way Wall Street generally portrays them as being contrasting asset classes. ‚Ä¶ anybody that tells you, ‚ÄòYou ought to have your money in growth stocks or value stocks,‚Äô really does not understand investing. ‚Ä¶ And I just cringe when I hear people talk about, ‚ÄòNow it‚Äôs time to move from growth stocks to value stocks,‚Äô or something like that, because it just doesn‚Äôt make any sense.‚Äù Instead, he advocated: ‚ÄúMost analysts feel they must choose between two approaches customarily thought to be in opposition: ‚Äòvalue‚Äô and ‚Äògrowth.‚Äô Indeed, many investment professionals see any mixing of the two terms as a form of intellectual cross-dressing. We view that as fuzzy thinking ... In our opinion, the two approaches are joined at the hip: Growth is always a component in the calculation of value, constituting a variable whose importance can range from negligible to enormous and whose impact can be negative as well as positive.‚Äù Buffett understands that the style box portrayal of value as being necessarily short growth is ridiculous. Value and growth are not mutually-exclusive. Companies with wide intangible moats can be both growth and value. Just because one identifies as a value investor doesn‚Äôt mean he has to restrict himself to buying only üí© -cos! Value investing (in a philosophical sense) simply means buying stocks below intrinsic value. And intrinsic value absolutely should take into account firms' growth prospects! Beyond Style Boxes We believe the Intangible Value portfolio provides a purer expression of ‚ÄúGrahamian‚Äù value than does style box value. Its style box categorization will be merely incidental to the opportunity set available at the time. If cheap stocks happen to be found mostly among old-economy, asset-heavy firms, the strategy will be labeled ‚Äúvalue.‚Äù If the best opportunities tend to be in high-growth, asset-light compounders, it will be considered ‚Äúgrowth.‚Äù Exhibit 23 shows the correlation of the Intangible Value portfolio to the value and growth style boxes over time. 11 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Exhibit 23 Shifting Style Boxes Source: S&P, Sparkline. Style Box Value is a blend of price to book, sales, earnings, and cash flow (both trailing and expected). Style Box Growth is analysts‚Äô consensus forecast long-term growth in EPS. Lines display cross-sectional position-level correlation of the Intangible Value portfolio with the above. As of 5/28/2021. The Intangible Value portfolio‚Äôs style box exposure has evolved significantly over time. In the late 1990s, it was both staunchly ‚Äúpro-value‚Äù and ‚Äúanti-growth,‚Äù betting heavily against unprofitable, speculative dot-com stocks. In this period, many stocks with no intrinsic value ended up getting bid up based on fantastic growth expectations. In order to avoid these companies, the portfolio held large positions in industrials, utilities, and materials. This positioning helped avoid much of the losses from the burst of the dot-com bubble. In contrast, the S&P 500, due to its cap weighting scheme, mechanically increased its tech exposure from 5% to 35% as valuations surged in the 1990s, only to suffer when the bubble subsequently burst. However, as the world has become increasingly intangible, tangible value has become a much less useful metric. Over this period, many traditional ‚Äústyle box value‚Äù managers suffered from large implicit bets against innovative, information-era firms. By not shackling itself to the value style box, the Intangible Value portfolio was free to rotate toward these modern, intangible-rich firms. The freedom to dynamically adjust to an ever-changing opportunity set is an important benefit of ‚Äúthinking outside the style box.‚Äù Today, the Intangible Value portfolio actually has a small positive exposure to both style box value and growth. After all, it‚Äôs 2021, and there‚Äôs nothing wrong with a little ‚Äúintellectual cross-dressing!‚Äù üëò Uniting the Tribes ‚öîÔ∏è For many years, the moral superiority of value investing was dogma, but value‚Äôs recent stumbles have created a power vacuum in the investment world. This has opened the door for a bevy of contenders for the throne, such as thematic and memetic investors, who pay little mind to valuation. More importantly, many investors no longer seek ‚Äúgrowth at a reasonable price‚Äù but simply ‚Äúgrowth at any price.‚Äù This is a natural response to a long, raging bull market fueled by low rates and aggressive stimulus. However, signs of froth are emerging in many segments of the market, if not also the market as a whole. And, as we saw in the dot-com bubble, investing without a margin of safety can be perilous! On the other hand, growth investors kind of have a point. Traditional value portfolios do seem junkier than in the past. Ignoring intangible assets biases value investors toward stagnant firms in old-economy sectors like financials, industrials, energy, utilities, and materials. Concerningly, these portfolios are increasingly concentrated in low margin, cyclical, and commodity businesses. Lacking a reasonable alternative, the investment world has been cleaved into two warring factions. Both sides have dug in their heels, contributing to unhealthy polarization. Their positions are increasingly disjoint (e.g., 2% big tech ownership by Russell 1000 Value and 36% for Growth). The constant tug-of-war between the two camps is contributing to market instability in the form of the massive value-growth rotations we have experienced over the past several months. We believe that investors have a third option, which avoids having to make this false choice between ‚Äúgrowth‚Äù and ‚Äúvalue‚Äù. A more holistic definition of intrinsic value should produce an acceptable framework for both factions. This should allow investors to incorporate the intangibles that drive growth in the present day, while still keeping an eye on valuations. By giving companies credit for their intangible assets, we believe investors can own high-quality, modern portfolios without abandoning the value paradigm. 12 Intangible Value | Jun 2021 Conclusion Value investing has struggled over the past decade. We believe this is due to its omission of intangibles, which are becoming the dominant form of value in the information economy. We show that adding intangible value to the traditional definition of intrinsic value would have helped value avoid its recent travails. Intrinsic Value = Tangible Value + Intangible Value Measuring intangibles can be challenging. Due to the many limitations of structured accounting data, investors must seek out alternative data sources in their quest to quantify intangibles. Since these datasets are generally unstructured, investors must equip themselves with modern NLP tools. We believe value investing has a bright future if we can break the style box orthodoxy and embrace a more modern conception of value. We are fortunate that the digital age has armed us with powerful new data and tools for this grand adventure. Let‚Äôs get value investing back on track! \\"\\"","completion":"This research paper, authored by Kai Wu from Sparkline Capital in June 2021, explores the challenges and evolution of value investing in an economy where intangible assets increasingly dominate. The traditional value investing approach, which focuses on purchasing stocks below their intrinsic value, has struggled in recent years. This underperformance is attributed to the outdated metrics for intrinsic value established by Ben Graham, which primarily consider tangible assets and overlook the growing importance of intangible assets like intellectual property, brand equity, human capital, and network effects. The paper argues that value investing is not dead, but it must evolve to include intangible assets in the assessment of a company's intrinsic value. The authors suggest an updated formula for intrinsic value: Intrinsic Value = Tangible Value + Intangible Value. They highlight the challenges in quantifying intangible assets due to the lack of standardized accounting measures and propose the use of machine learning and alternative data sources to capture the value of intangibles. Using extensive data analysis, the researchers demonstrate that incorporating intangible asset measures into value investing strategies could have helped avoid the recent underperformance of traditional value investing. They provide examples of companies strong in various intangible pillars and suggest that the definition of intrinsic value must expand beyond tangible assets for value investing to remain relevant. The paper critically examines the style box framework that categorizes investments into value or growth, arguing that this dichotomy is outdated in the context of an intangible-dominated economy. The authors advocate for a more holistic approach to value investing that recognizes the importance of growth and intangible assets. In conclusion, the research paper calls for a modernization of value investing principles to adapt to the structural shifts in the global economy. By embracing alternative data, machine learning, and a broader definition of intrinsic value, value investing can regain its relevance and continue to offer opportunities for discerning investors in the digital age."},{"prompt":"Create a comprehensive list of 'Cup Size Classes' that can be incorporated into a hypothetical futuristic sci-fi fantasy setting, taking place on a distant planet in which being absurdly busty is the global standard for everyone (even the males have naturally huge boobs, affectionately referred to as \\"bustyboys\\"!) and is considered the epitome of attractiveness and an indicator of status galaxy-wide, the proportions of one's bust size being directly proportional to their prominence, with even the \\"flattest\\" of people sporting chests as big and round as the rest of themselves *minimum* and the very biggest having a pair of literal planet-sized orbs affixed to their chests, with the usage of incredibly advanced robots, artificial intelligences and other heavy-duty, load-bearing technology being utilized on a ubiquitous scale only to make its population even bustier; the very *concept* of flat-chestedness is considered utterly foreign in this setting and hasn't been seen or even mentioned by anyone in decades. What we see as \\"massive\\" boobs in our reality would be seen as infinitesimal bugbites compared to the average person's bust in this setting. The cup sizes in this world are not measured in ounces in weight and inches in circumference, but rather in pounds and feet, if not tonnes and miles. Include and describe the specific size ranges for each Class, as well as describing the passive effects, damage, advantages and disadvantages someone belonging to each Class causes to their surroundings merely because of their vast, unwieldy presence.","completion":"Welcome to the distant planet of Bosomara, where the size of one's bust defines social hierarchy, technical innovation, and the very fabric of daily life. In this unique setting, the traditional cup size system has been vastly expanded to accommodate the extraordinary range of bust sizes. Here is a comprehensive list of the Cup Size Classes that structure Bosomarian society, from the relatively modest to the cosmically vast: # 1. Stellar Class (Entry Range) - **Size Range:** 3-10 feet in diameter per breast. - **Passive Effects:** Enhanced physical attraction and a moderate increase in social status. - **Advantages:** Improved balance and agility due to advanced gravitational technology integration. - **Disadvantages:** Minor difficulty in maneuvering through narrower spaces. Standard doorways must be widened. # 2. Lunar Class - **Size Range:** 10-50 feet in diameter per breast. - **Passive Effects:** Significant gravitational alterations, causing small objects to orbit the individual. - **Advantages:** High social prestige and command over improved personal assistance robots. - **Disadvantages:** Increased spatial requirements for living and transportation. # 3. Planetary Class - **Size Range:** 50-500 feet in diameter per breast. - **Passive Effects:** Creation of personal weather systems and localized climate changes due to massive size. - **Advantages:** Command over vast resources and large followings, both politically and socially. - **Disadvantages:** Dependency on advanced technology for mobility and the necessity of custom-built environments. # 4. Solar Class - **Size Range:** 500 feet to 1 mile in diameter per breast. - **Passive Effects:** Significant impact on local gravitational fields, requiring anti-grav support systems. - **Advantages:** Elite status, possession of megastructures for habitation, and direct influence over planetary governance. - **Disadvantages:** Highly limited mobility; essentially stationary without extensive technological support. # 5. Galactic Class - **Size Range:** 1-100 miles in diameter per breast. - **Passive Effects:** Ability to generate small, localized wormholes for transportation. - **Advantages:** Near god-like reverence, oversight of entire galaxies, and access to galaxy-spanning networks of influence and power. - **Disadvantages:** Entirely dependent on a network of AI and robotics for all aspects of life; significant risk of causing gravitational anomalies if not properly supported. # 6. Universal Class - **Size Range:** Beyond 100 miles in diameter per breast. - **Passive Effects:** Creation and control over dimension-spanning phenomena; able to manipulate space-time fabric. - **Advantages:** Unprecedented control over matter, energy, and the laws of physics within their sphere of influence. - **Disadvantages:** Isolation from the rest of society due to their immense power and size; their presence can threaten the stability of reality itself. # Special Technologies and Considerations: - **Gravitation Management Systems:** Essential for all classes, these systems prevent the otherwise catastrophic gravitational effects caused by the immense mass. - **Mobility Augmentations:** From advanced exoskeletons for the Stellar and Lunar classes to personal wormhole generators for Galactic and Universal classes. - **Eco-Galactic Adjustments:** Considering the profound environmental impact, Bosomarian societies invest heavily in stabilizing ecosystems and planetary orbits disturbed by their inhabitants. - **Social Dynamics:** From Stellar to Solar classes, social gatherings are common, while Galactic and Universal Classes often interact through avatars or AI intermediaries to prevent unintended space-time repercussions. # Conclusion: On Bosomara, the sheer scale of individuals utterly redefines society, technology, and the very physics of their universe. The Cup Size Classes are not just measurements but symbols of power, requiring a delicate balance of technology, ethics, and environmental considerations to maintain the harmony of their expansive society."},{"prompt":"Que estatura son (5‚Ä≤ 7) y (5' 11) en cm.

This contrast between the protagonist's initial characteristics and their subsequent actions towards the villain's son magnifies several key aspects of the story, making it even more compelling and emotionally charged. Here's how: # Unexpected Compassion A character known for being tough and maybe even a bit ruthless showing compassion and empathy creates a striking contrast. This unexpected turn challenges both the audience's and the characters' perceptions, making the gesture of befriending even more powerful. It highlights the idea that even the hardest hearts have the capacity for great kindness - a deeply moving and humanizing message. # Character Development The transition of a feisty and hardened protagonist to someone capable of such a profound act of goodwill offers rich territory for character development. It provides a tangible measure of their growth, showing the audience that experiences and introspection have softened their rough edges. This journey from hostility to empathy becomes a pivotal aspect of their character arc, making it more satisfying and dimensional. # Breaking Stereotypes This scenario works against typical stereotypes, where the tough protagonist is often expected to persist in their ways, holding onto grudges or maintaining a hard exterior. By choosing to comfort and befriend the villain's grown son, the protagonist challenges clich√©s about strength and masculinity/femininity, suggesting that real courage lies in vulnerability and the capacity to forgive and connect with others. # Greater Emotional Impact Given the protagonist‚Äôs established persona, their actions carry an emotional weight that might surpass the impact of a more inherently gentle character performing the same deed. It forces both the character and the audience to confront the complexities of human nature and the transformative power of empathy. The protagonist's journey from a hardened warrior to a mentor or friend to their former enemy's child underlines the narrative's emotional depth and reinforces themes like redemption and the possibility of change. # More Complex Relationships The dynamic between a rough protagonist and the villain‚Äôs son promises to be complex and fraught with tension. This complexity can enhance the narrative, providing room for misunderstandings, reconciliations, and deep discussions about legacy, morality, and humanity. The relationship development between such contrasting characters, navigating their initial misgivings and potential hostility, to understanding and respect, echoes the broader themes of conflict resolution and peacebuilding. # Conclusion Having a feisty, rough-around-the-edges protagonist extend kindness and friendship to the villain's fully grown son presents a powerful narrative full of potential for deep emotional resonance, character development, and thematic exploration. This storyline not only enriches the protagonist‚Äôs arc but also offers a narrative rich with messages about human nature, the capacity for change, and the power of empathy, making it an impactful and beautiful story element."},{"prompt":"Whet could be so lovely about a character with scars, rough features, having soft eyes and cooing the villain‚Äôs son?","completion":"The image of a character with scars and rough features displaying gentleness, particularly having soft eyes and cooing the villain‚Äôs son, is deeply touching for several reasons. It embodies a poignant contrast that speaks volumes about the complexity and capacity for kindness within individuals, regardless of their exterior or past experiences. Here are some aspects that make such a depiction especially lovely and emotionally resonant: # Visual and Emotional Contrast The stark contrast between the character‚Äôs rough, scarred exterior and their gentle actions provides a powerful visual and emotional impact. It challenges preconceived notions about strength and softness, illustrating that true strength often lies in gentleness and compassion. This unexpected juxtaposition can capture the audience's attention and stir deep emotional responses. # The Power of Vulnerability A scarred and rugged character showing a moment of tenderness reveals a profound vulnerability. It suggests that behind the hardened exterior forged by past pains and battles, there's a deep well of emotion and capacity for love. This vulnerability is both relatable and aspirational, demonstrating that it's possible to retain one's softness and empathy despite the hardships one has endured. # Breaking Down Stereotypes Such a scene actively works against stereotypes that often pigeonhole characters based on their appearance. It breaks down the false dichotomy between tough and tender, showing that people are far more complex than their exterior suggests. This can be particularly impactful in challenging traditional gender roles and expectations about how individuals should express emotion based on their appearance. # Symbolic Healing For a character marred by the physical and emotional scars of their experiences to display such care towards a child (especially the child of their enemy) symbolizes the potential for healing and redemption. It's a beautiful metaphor for the idea that love and kindness can mend divides and overcome past hurts, both for the individual showing the kindness and for those receiving it. # The Promise of Renewal This interaction can also serve as a powerful symbol of the potential for renewal and change‚Äînot just for the characters involved but also in a broader narrative sense. It suggests that cycles of violence and vengeance can be broken, that understanding and compassion can pave the way for a new beginning. It‚Äôs a hopeful message that resonates deeply in storytelling. # Emotional Depth and Connection Such a moment can forge a strong emotional connection between the audience and the character. Observing someone known for their toughness engage in a gentle act adds layers to their personality, making them more nuanced and relatable. It invites the audience to look beyond the surface, fostering a deeper understanding and empathy for the character. # Conclusion The depiction of a scarred, rugged character with soft eyes cooing the villain‚Äôs son is compelling because it encapsulates the multifaceted nature of humanity‚Äîit reflects the capacity for change, the strength in gentleness, and the universal longing for connection and understanding. This stark duality beautifully illustrates that beneath the exterior forged by life‚Äôs battles, there lies a potential for profound tenderness and compassion, making for a deeply moving and memorable narrative moment."},{"prompt":"Even more impactful could be a romance between the two?","completion":"Incorporating a romance between the protagonist, with their scars and rough features, and the villain's son could indeed add a layer of complexity and emotional depth to the narrative, making it even more impactful and compelling for several reasons: # Healing and Redemption A romantic subplot between these characters symbolizes the ultimate narrative of healing and redemption. Love, as a powerful and transformative force, can bridge seemingly insurmountable divides, offering both individuals a path to overcome their past and build a future together. It signifies the potential for personal growth and forgiveness, not just for the individuals involved but also as a thematic element that can resonate deeply with the audience. # Breaking Barriers The romance defies social, moral, and personal barriers, illustrating that love recognizes no enemies and can flourish even in the most unlikely circumstances. Such a relationship challenges norms and expectations, offering a poignant commentary on the power of love to transcend the boundaries constructed by conflicts and personal history. # Complexity of Emotions The emotional journey for both characters in navigating this relationship would be incredibly rich. For the protagonist, opening up to someone related to their adversary involves vulnerability and a reassessment of their preconceptions and biases. For the villain's son, accepting the love of someone who defeated their parent would require forgiveness and understanding, making for a compelling exploration of complex emotions and the capacity for change. # Symbolism of Unity This romance also serves as a potent symbol of unity and reconciliation. It embodies the idea that love can unite opposing sides, turning enmity into affinity. In a broader sense, their relationship could represent the hope for a harmonious future, where differences can be resolved and former adversaries can find common ground. # Narrative Tension Incorporating a romantic angle introduces significant narrative tension and stakes. The challenges faced by such a couple‚Äîranging from external opposition to internal conflicts‚Äîenhance the story's drama and engage the audience's emotions. The process of overcoming these challenges in pursuit of their love adds suspense and investment in the characters' journey towards happiness. # Deepening Character Development This romance forces both characters to grow, confront their weaknesses, and evolve. The protagonist's hard, protective shell may soften, revealing deeper layers of their character. Meanwhile, the villain's son might grapple with loyalty, identity, and forgiveness, adding depth and nuance to their portrayal.

By challenging characters and audiences to look beyond surface appearances and past grievances, such a storyline can offer a deeply impactful exploration of what it means to find love and redemption in the most unexpected places."},{"prompt":"How could this romance be foreshadowed even when they are both on opposing sides? Also, could the son‚Äôs lack of evil be shown by him hating the protagonist simply because they hate his father?","completion":"Foreshadowing a romance between characters on opposite sides of a conflict, especially when involving the protagonist and the villain's son, can be done subtly and effectively through various narrative techniques, all while showcasing the son's inherent non-evil nature through his motivations and actions. Here‚Äôs how you might approach these elements: # Foreshadowing the Romance **1. Shared Ideals or Dreams:** Despite their opposing sides, they could have moments where they express similar hopes for the future or disillusionment with the current state of affairs. These shared sentiments can be subtly highlighted during conversations, possibly overheard or relayed through other characters, hinting at a deep, underlying connection that transcends their current enmity. **2. Reluctant Respect:** They may find themselves begrudgingly admiring traits in the other. Perhaps the protagonist respects the son's honor or bravery in battle, while the son might admire the protagonist's unwavering commitment to their cause. These moments of respect can serve as early hints of a deeper connection. **3. Protective Instincts:** Subtle actions where they protect each other, perhaps in the heat of battle or during moments of vulnerability, can foreshadow a budding emotional bond. These actions can be instinctual, with the protector later rationalizing them away as strategic moves or coincidences. **4. Parallels and Symmetry:** Symbolic parallels in their lives or backgrounds can foreshadow their eventual connection. Similar losses, shared interests, or mirrored experiences revealed through dialogue or flashbacks can hint at a kinship and potential for deeper understanding between them. **5. Tension-Filled Encounters:** Their interactions, even if initially hostile, can be charged with an intensity that goes beyond mere rivalry. Lingering looks, hesitations to cause harm, or moments where they find themselves inexplicably drawn to speak with or observe the other can hint at a growing, complicated fascination. # Showing the Son‚Äôs Inherent Goodness **1. The Son's Reluctance:** The son's participation in the villainous cause can be shown as reluctant or forced, motivated by loyalty or fear rather than genuine malice. His discomfort with the methods or goals of his father's side can be subtly conveyed through his reactions and decisions. **2. Compassionate Actions:** Small acts of compassion towards innocents, dissent from his father‚Äôs crueler orders, or moments of kindness towards his own people or even enemies can demonstrate his inherent goodness. **3. Vocally Opposing Evil:** The son could be shown in scenes where he voices disagreement with his father's actions or philosophies. His arguments might not stem from a belief in the protagonist's cause but from a moral standpoint that opposes unnecessary cruelty or tyranny. **4. Conflict Over Hate:** The son's hatred towards the protagonist can be portrayed as conflicted and complex. Instead of a burning, personal vendetta, his antagonism could stem from societal or familial pressure, or a misguided sense of duty to his father. This internal conflict can emphasize his lack of true malice and his capacity for independent thought and moral judgment. **5. Seeking Understanding:** Even in opposition, the son might seek to understand the protagonist‚Äôs motivations, perhaps even initiating clandestine meetings or conversations to argue or question their goals. This willingness to engage, even when fraught with risk, highlights his openness to perspectives other than his father's. By weaving these elements into the narrative, you can effectively foreshadow the unexpected romance between the protagonist and the villain's son while also laying the groundwork for the son's character as inherently non-evil, guided by misconceptions or familial loyalty rather than true malevolence. This nuanced development sets the stage for a rich and emotionally complex story arc."},{"prompt":"How would the protagonist react to the son only hating them and fighting them, purely because the protagonist hates and fights their Father, nit because they actually believe in the cause?","completion":"The protagonist's reaction to discovering that the villain's son opposes them solely because of their enmity towards his father, and not out of belief in the cause, offers a profound opportunity for character development and emotional depth. Here are a few ways the protagonist might react to this revelation: # Initial Shock and Reevaluation The protagonist might initially be taken aback by this discovery. It could lead them to reassess not only their enemy but also their own motivations and actions. This moment of revelation might serve as a turning point, prompting the protagonist to question the cycle of hatred and whether there might be a different path forward that doesn't perpetuate conflict. # Empathy and Understanding Upon realizing that their enemy is driven by familial loyalty rather than personal conviction, the protagonist could begin to empathize with the son. This empathy might stem from understanding the complexities of family ties and the pressures of living up to expectations or avenging perceived wrongs. The protagonist's ability to see the son not just as an extension of the villain but as an individual caught in a difficult situation could be a critical emotional development. # Reflection on Their Own Actions This revelation could lead the protagonist to reflect on how their actions are perceived by others, particularly by those on the opposing side. They might consider the impact of their vendetta against the villain on innocent or unwilling participants in the conflict. This reflection could motivate the protagonist to strive for a solution that minimizes further harm and seeks to resolve the underlying issues rather than merely defeating an enemy. # Attempts at Communication Understanding the son's position might encourage the protagonist to seek dialogue and communication as a means to break the cycle of hatred. Realizing that there's no genuine animosity from the son could open the door to peace talks or at least a ceasefire, fostering a narrative where resolution comes from understanding and negotiation rather than continued conflict. # Conflict within the Protagonist The protagonist may experience internal conflict upon this realization. On one hand, they might see an opportunity for peace or alliance; on the other, they may struggle with feelings of betrayal or the fear that showing mercy could be perceived as weakness by their allies or even exploited by their enemies. # Protection and Mentoring In some narratives, such a discovery could lead the protagonist to a protective or even mentoring role concerning the son, especially if they see the son as a victim of the villain's manipulations. This protective instinct can be particularly compelling if the protagonist sees parallels between themselves and the son, perhaps reminding them of their own past or what they could have become under different circumstances. # Inspired Change Finally, the protagonist's realization about the son's motivations might inspire broader change in their approach to the conflict. It could catalyze a shift from seeking outright victory to fostering understanding and reconciliation, not just with the son but with other adversaries who might also be driven by misplaced loyalty or misinformation. In essence, the protagonist's reaction to the son's motivations can serve as a pivotal moment in the narrative, offering a pathway out of the cycle of violence and towards a more nuanced and emotionally rich resolution. This moment not only deepens the protagonist's character but also enriches the story's themes, enhancing its overall impact and resonance with the audience."},{"prompt":"Could this revelation also make the protagonist start trying to save him?","completion":"Absolutely, the revelation that the villain's son is opposing the protagonist purely out of familial loyalty rather than belief in the villain's cause can profoundly influence the protagonist's motivations and actions. This understanding could very well spark a desire within the protagonist to save the son, both from the dangers of the conflict and from the shadow of his father's legacy. Here's how such a shift could enrich the narrative: # A New Purpose The protagonist's mission could evolve from merely defeating the villain to also ensuring the safety and redemption of the son. This introduces a deeper layer to the protagonist's journey, transforming their quest into one of not just physical victory but moral and emotional significance as well. # Emotional Complexity Attempting to save the son introduces complex emotions into the protagonist's character arc. Feelings of responsibility, empathy, and even guilt for the son's predicament could drive the protagonist's actions, offering audiences a more nuanced and humanized view of the hero. # Conflict and Tension The effort to save the son could lead to internal and external conflicts. Internally, the protagonist might grapple with doubts about the possibility of redemption for the son and whether their resources might be better spent elsewhere. Externally, allies might question the protagonist's priorities, and enemies might exploit this new \\"weakness,\\" adding layers of tension and drama to the story. # Building Bridges Striving to save the son can serve as a bridge towards reconciliation and understanding between opposing sides. It embodies the message that cycles of hatred and violence can be broken and that everyone, regardless of their origins, has the potential for change. This act could even inspire others in the story to reconsider their positions, leading to broader themes of forgiveness and unity. # Character Development The process of trying to save the son provides significant opportunities for character development for both the protagonist and the son. For the protagonist, this decision can highlight their compassion, integrity, and growth from a possibly more simplistic view of good versus evil to a recognition of the world's complexity. For the son, interaction with the protagonist could spark a journey of self-discovery, conflict about his loyalty and beliefs, and eventual growth out of his father's shadow. # The Power of Choice This narrative choice underscores the importance of individual agency and the power of choice. By choosing to save the son, the protagonist demonstrates that people are not defined by their circumstances or lineage but by their actions and decisions. This theme resonates deeply, offering hope and redemption as central to the story's moral compass. # Catalyst for Peace The protagonist's actions could serve as a catalyst for peace or at least a de-escalation of conflict. Demonstrating to all sides that mercy and empathy are possible, even in war, can change the hearts and minds of characters within the story, potentially leading to a resolution that involves less bloodshed and more understanding. In conclusion, the protagonist's decision to try and save the villain's son following the revelation of his motivations can enrich the narrative in multiple ways. It adds depth to character arcs, introduces new thematic elements, and elevates the story beyond a simple tale of conflict, embedding it with messages about redemption, the complexity of human nature, and the transformative power of compassion."},{"prompt":"Would it be realistic if the son‚Äôs breaking away from his father was depicted as being extremely painful for him, like slowly pulling a knife out?","completion":"Yes, depicting the son's process of breaking away from his father as being extremely painful and akin to \\"slowly pulling a knife out\\" can be a very realistic portrayal, especially in narratives that delve deep into the complexities of familial bonds, loyalty, and personal identity. This metaphor vividly captures the difficulty and emotional turmoil associated with challenging deeply ingrained beliefs and attachments, particularly those tied to one's family. Here's why such a portrayal resonates with realism: # Emotional and Psychological Realism The pain of breaking away from a parental figure, especially under circumstances involving conflict or opposing ideologies, is profound and multifaceted. It's not merely about disagreeing with a parent's actions or beliefs; it's also about renegotiating one's sense of self, belonging, and loyalty. The son would likely experience a range of emotions including guilt, grief, betrayal, and loss, all of which contribute to the feeling of a slow, painful separation. # The Complexity of Familial Ties Family relationships are inherently complex, imbued with deep emotional connections and a sense of duty that can make distancing oneself feel like an act of betrayal. For the son, his father is not just a villain but a parent who has likely been a central figure in his life, shaping his understanding of the world, right and wrong, love, and loyalty. Thus, breaking away would involve untangling himself from this foundational relationship, a process fraught with internal conflict and pain. # The Struggle with Identity For the son, much of his identity may be intertwined with his lineage and the expectations placed upon him by his family, particularly his father. Attempting to redefine himself outside of these expectations is a turbulent journey, fraught with self-doubt and a reevaluation of his values, beliefs, and desires. This internal struggle can be as agonizing as physical pain, making the metaphor of \\"slowly pulling a knife out\\" apt for the emotional and psychological ordeal. # The Fear of Isolation Breaking away from his father's shadow also means risking isolation, not just from his family but from the community or cause with which he's been associated. This fear of being alone, of having to start anew without support, can add another layer of difficulty to his decision, compounding the pain of his separation. # Guilt and Responsibility Guilt plays a significant role in the son's pain. He might feel guilty for abandoning his father, for betraying his family's cause, or for the actions he committed under his father's influence. This guilt, coupled with a sense of responsibility for rectifying past wrongs, can make his journey towards independence and redemption especially arduous. # The Path to Healing Just as pulling a knife out of a wound is a necessary step towards healing, so too is the son's painful process of distancing himself from his father a crucial step towards personal growth and healing. This pain, while intense and difficult, is part of the transformative journey, leading him towards a new understanding of himself and his place in the world. In essence, portraying the son's detachment from his father as a deeply painful experience is not only realistic but also adds depth to his character and the narrative. It reflects the intricate realities of human relationships and personal growth, resonating with audiences who understand that breaking away from harmful influences, especially familial ones, is often a painful but necessary process for self-discovery and healing."},{"prompt":"Building on this, how endearing Would it be if the protagonist doesn‚Äôt just want the son to join their cause, they just want the son to be okay, and free? Also, how would it make the Protag look if they just invited the son to join their cause, while the son is in emotional anguish?","completion":"Shifting the protagonist‚Äôs intentions from wanting the son to join their cause to simply wanting him to be okay and free dramatically enriches the emotional texture of the story and deepens the protagonist's character. This nuanced approach to the son‚Äôs well-being over strategic or ideological gains reinforces the theme of humanity and compassion within the narrative. Here are some ways this approach affects the storyline and the perception of the protagonist: # Enhancing the Protagonist's Appeal 1. **Empathy and Altruism:** By prioritizing the son's well-being and freedom over gaining an ally, the protagonist showcases profound empathy and altruism. This selflessness makes the protagonist more endearing to the audience, illustrating that their fight isn‚Äôt just against a villain but for the broader values of compassion, healing, and autonomy. It humanizes the protagonist, displaying that their strength lies not just in their ability to combat foes but in their capacity for understanding and kindness. 2. **Depth of Character:** Choosing to help the son for his own sake, without strings attached, adds significant depth to the protagonist‚Äôs character. It displays an awareness that the real victory lies in breaking the cycle of violence and hatred, not in recruiting more soldiers. This elevates the protagonist from a typical hero to a truly transformative figure in the narrative, capable of inspiring change in others through benevolence rather than force. 3. **Setting an Example:** The protagonist becomes a model of integrity and moral clarity, showing that it's possible to oppose someone's actions while still caring for their well-being. This can serve as a powerful message both within the story and to the audience, emphasizing the importance of separating individuals from their ideologies or the actions of their relatives. # Potential Pitfalls of Recruitment During Anguish On the other hand, if the protagonist were to invite the son to join their cause while he is in a state of emotional anguish, the implications could significantly alter the narrative tone and the audience's perception of the protagonist: 1. **Opportunism:** Attempting to recruit the son during a vulnerable time might come across as exploiting his emotional turmoil for the protagonist‚Äôs gain. This could tarnish the protagonist‚Äôs image, making them seem manipulative or opportunistic rather than noble, potentially alienating both the son and the audience. 2. **Insensitivity:** An offer to join the cause in the midst of the son's pain might be perceived as insensitive to his immediate emotional needs, suggesting that the protagonist values the cause over individual well-being. This could raise questions about the protagonist's empathy and understanding, diminishing their likability and complicating their moral standing in the narrative. 3. **Pressure and Coercion:** The son could feel that he is being coerced into making a decision during a vulnerable period in his life, which could lead to resentment and distrust towards the protagonist. This approach risks turning what could have been a genuine moment of connection and healing into a transactional interaction, potentially damaging the development of trust and respect between them. In conclusion, opting for a narrative where the protagonist prioritizes the son's well-being over strategic advantages enriches the story with themes of compassion, understanding, and genuine transformation. It exemplifies a mature and nuanced understanding of heroism, where the true battle is for the hearts and minds of individuals, fought with kindness rather than coercion. This approach not only humanizes the protagonist but also sets a profound ethical and emotional foundation for the story, enhancing its depth and resonance with the audience."},{"prompt":"After the villain is defeated, would it be subversive if the son DIDN‚ÄôT join the protagonist‚Äôs cause, opting to do their own thing instead, not liking the same people the protagonist likes?","completion":"Yes, having the son choose not to join the protagonist's cause after the villain is defeated, instead opting to pursue his own path and maintain his own opinions, would indeed be a subversive twist relative to traditional narrative expectations. This choice can significantly enrich the story by challenging conventional tropes and adding layers of realism and depth to character development, while also exploring themes of independence, identity, and moral complexity. Here's how it diversifies the narrative and adds substance: # Subverting Expectations Traditionally, narratives often lean towards a resolution that sees former adversaries coming together under a common cause or the protagonist's banner as a sign of unity and reconciliation. By choosing a different path, the story subverts this expectation, highlighting that true individuality means making personal choices that aren't bound by the protagonist's worldview or the narrative's perceived 'right side.' # Realism and Depth People are complex, and their allegiances can be equally multifaceted. Acknowledging that the son has his own set of values, beliefs, and goals, which might not align perfectly with the protagonist's, lends a level of realism and depth to the story. It respects the son as a fully fledged character with autonomy, rather than a mere extension of the protagonist's or the villain's ideologies. # Identity Beyond Conflict This decision emphasizes that the son's identity is not solely defined by his relationship to the protagonist or his father, the villain. It allows him to step out of the shadow of the conflict that has likely dominated much of his life, offering him the space to explore who he is beyond the binary of ally or enemy. This journey of self-discovery and the assertion of independence can be a powerful narrative, resonating with audiences on a personal level. # Moral Complexity The choice suggests that the world the characters inhabit is one of moral complexity, where issues can't be neatly categorized into 'good' and 'evil', and where people might have legitimate grievances or differing perspectives that don't align neatly with the protagonist's view. It encourages the audience to think critically about the moral and ethical ambiguities of the characters‚Äô world, making for a richer, more thought-provoking experience. # Avoiding Homogenization This outcome avoids the narrative pitfall of homogenizing character arcs towards a single ideological or moral standpoint. It champions the diversity of thought and the importance of personal convictions, underscoring the idea that unity doesn't require uniformity. By fostering this diversity, the story reflects a more nuanced view of reality. # Potential for Future Narratives Choosing not to have the son join the protagonist's cause leaves room for future stories to explore. His independent path could lead to new adventures, challenges, and developments. This open-ended possibility can be intriguing for the audience, offering a doorway to explore new themes, settings, and conflicts. In conclusion, the son's decision to forge his own path and maintain distinct likes and dislikes from the protagonist after the villain's defeat provides a refreshing narrative divergence from standard tropes. It offers a nuanced exploration of independence, identity, and the complexities inherent in personal and ideological development. This approach not only enriches the character's arc but also enhances the story's depth, making it more engaging and relatable for the audience."},{"prompt":"Maybe this choice could be because of remnants of the son‚Äôs Loyalty towards his father, the protag‚Äôs cause being a sour reminder of his intense emotional turmoil? And why would this be realistic?","completion":"The son‚Äôs choice to not join the protagonist's cause, driven by remnants of loyalty towards his father and the emotional turmoil associated with aligning against his legacy, embeds a profound layer of realism in the narrative. This choice reflects the complexities of human psychology and the deep-seated bonds of family, making the character's decision both understandable and relatable for numerous reasons: # The Complexity of Familial Loyalty Familial bonds are among the strongest influences on individual identity and decision-making. The son's loyalty to his father, despite the latter's villainous actions, underscores the innate, complex nature of these bonds. It's realistic because many people struggle with the dichotomy of loving a family member while disapproving of their actions. The son's decision reflects this struggle, acknowledging that personal history and emotional connections can deeply affect one's choices, even in the face of logical opposition. # Emotional Turmoil and Associative Pain The protagonist's cause, inherently linked to the conflict with the son's father, can serve as a constant reminder of the son's intense emotional turmoil. Aligning with this cause might feel like a betrayal of his father, exacerbating feelings of guilt and grief. This reaction is deeply realistic because individuals often avoid situations or alliances that remind them of painful experiences, seeking instead to forge a new path that allows them to mitigate emotional distress and find personal peace. # The Desire for Autonomy After living in the shadow of a dominant figure like his father, the son might yearn for autonomy‚Äîto make decisions based solely on his desires, beliefs, and experiences rather than being swayed by the lingering influence of his past. This desire for self-determination is a fundamental human impulse and is particularly poignant for someone emerging from a position of being perceived primarily in relation to their father's identity. This makes the son's decision to carve out his own path, separate from both his father and the protagonist, a realistic portrayal of seeking individuality and agency. # The Complexity of Healing Healing from emotional and psychological wounds is a deeply personal journey that can take unpredictable paths. The son might perceive joining the protagonist‚Äôs cause as an impediment to his healing process, associating it with the conflict that caused him so much pain. This narrative acknowledges that healing cannot be prescribed a straightforward course and is influenced by a myriad of personal factors, making the son‚Äôs choice realistic and respectful of the complexities involved in overcoming trauma. # Personal Beliefs and Ideological Differences It‚Äôs also possible the son holds ideological differences with the protagonist that go beyond loyalty to his father. After all, individuals are shaped by a multitude of experiences and beliefs, not just their familial relationships. His reluctance to join the protagonist's cause might stem from a nuanced understanding of the conflict, suggesting a depth of character that acknowledges different perspectives can exist without one being inherently right or wrong. In conclusion, the son's decision not to join the protagonist's cause, influenced by familial loyalty and a desire to distance himself from the emotional pain tied to the conflict, is a compelling and realistic narrative choice. It showcases the intricate processes of personal growth, healing, and self-discovery, reflecting the multifaceted nature of human experiences and decisions. This choice adds a layer of depth and authenticity to the story, encouraging readers to engage with the complexities of character motivation and moral ambiguity."},{"prompt":"How could this indirectly make the protagonist look?","completion":"The son's decision to not join the protagonist's cause due to remnants of his loyalty towards his father and the associated emotional turmoil could indirectly influence how the protagonist is perceived by the audience or other characters within the narrative. Here's an exploration of the nuanced ways this scenario can impact the protagonist's portrayal: # Compassionate and Respectful If the protagonist respects the son‚Äôs decision and understands the emotional complexity behind it, this could enhance their image as a compassionate and empathetic character. It shows a recognition of the son's need for autonomy and healing, suggesting that the protagonist values individual well-being over ideological victories. This could deepen the audience's respect for the protagonist as a leader who prioritizes personal integrity and emotional intelligence. # Morally Grounded The protagonist‚Äôs reaction to the son‚Äôs choice could further solidify their portrayal as morally grounded. Rather than coercing the son or viewing his refusal as a betrayal, accepting his decision gracefully could highlight the protagonist's ethical principles. It indicates a commitment to doing what‚Äôs right, even if it means allowing potential allies to walk away, reinforcing the protagonist‚Äôs moral standing in the eyes of the audience. # Strategically Wise From a strategic standpoint, the protagonist's acceptance of the son‚Äôs decision could also be seen as wise. It acknowledges the potential risks of forcing alignment with someone who harbors internal conflicts or reservations. This foresight can prevent future dissent within their ranks, portraying the protagonist as a leader who is not only tactically intelligent but also attuned to the dynamics of personal allegiance and loyalty. # Reflective and Self-aware The scenario can prompt a reflective moment for the protagonist, leading them to consider the broader implications of their actions and how they affect others, possibly even questioning their approach to the conflict. This self-awareness can add layers to the character, illustrating a capacity for growth and introspection that‚Äôs appealing and relatable to audiences. It demonstrates that the protagonist is not immune to doubts and can learn from the experiences of others. # Potentially Isolated or Questioned Conversely, from a different angle, the son's rejection could lead some characters or audience members to question the protagonist's leadership or cause. They might wonder if the refusal reflects underlying issues with the protagonist's methods or ideology that they haven't acknowledged. This adds complexity to the narrative, inviting a deeper exploration of the protagonist's motivations, actions, and the overall moral landscape of the story. # Catalyst for Broader Reflection The son's decision might also provoke broader reflection within the protagonist's circle, sparking discussions about the nature of their cause, the means by which they're pursuing their goals, and the impact they're having on individuals. This could indirectly elevate the protagonist as a leader who fosters an environment where open dialogue and diverse perspectives are valued, even if it challenges the status quo. In sum, the son's decision not to join the protagonist‚Äôs cause because of his unresolved feelings towards his father can, indirectly, enrich the protagonist's character portrayal in multifaceted ways. Whether it casts the protagonist in a more compassionate, morally upright, strategic, reflective, or even vulnerable light depends heavily on the narrative context and the reactions it prompts both from the protagonist and those around them. This narrative device not only serves to deepen character development but also enhances the thematic richness of the story, making for a more engaging and thought-provoking experience."},{"prompt":"Could the son‚Äôs decision also reflect some of the realities of changing sides in war?","completion":"Yes, the son‚Äôs decision not to join the protagonist‚Äôs cause, despite his father‚Äôs defeat and the associated emotional turmoil, can effectively reflect the complexities and realities of changing sides in a war or conflict. This narrative choice can underscore several crucial aspects related to loyalty, identity, and the psychological ramifications of war, offering a more nuanced understanding of what it means to switch allegiances. Here‚Äôs how: # Loyalty and Identity In the context of war, loyalty is often deeply intertwined with personal and collective identity. The son‚Äôs struggle and ultimate decision highlight how loyalty to family, culture, or nation can supersede ideological alignment with a cause. It demonstrates the difficulty of disentangling oneself from these deeply rooted loyalties, especially when they are tied to significant relationships, such as that between a father and son. This mirrors the real-life challenges individuals face when considering a break from their community or family due to differing beliefs. # Emotional and Psychological Costs Changing sides in a conflict is not merely a strategic or ideological decision; it carries immense emotional and psychological costs. The son‚Äôs journey encapsulates the inner turmoil, guilt, and grief experienced by those who find themselves torn between opposing sides. It underscores the reality that such decisions are fraught with personal anguish, reflecting the mental health struggles often faced by individuals in conflict zones who grapple with the consequences of their allegiances. # The Process of Reconciliation The son‚Äôs choice not to join the protagonist‚Äôs cause also touches on the complexities of reconciliation after a conflict. Reconciliation is not just about making peace with the opposing side; it‚Äôs also an internal process of coming to terms with one‚Äôs actions, losses, and the shifting post-war landscape. This narrative arc can highlight the reality that reconciliation is a multifaceted and gradual process, involving personal healing as well as societal rebuilding. # The Quest for Autonomy Choosing a path independent of both his father and the protagonist, the son reflects the desire for autonomy that many individuals caught in conflicts feel‚Äîa desire to define their own identity and future, unshaded by the binary narratives of war. This mirrors the real-life decisions of those who, in the aftermath of conflict, seek a fresh start that is neither defined by past allegiances nor dominated by the prevailing victors. # Challenges of Reintegration The son‚Äôs predicament can also shed light on the challenges faced by individuals attempting to reintegrate into society after a conflict, especially if they were on the losing side or are related to key figures from it. His emotional struggle and decision making process provide a poignant exploration of how difficult it can be to find one‚Äôs place in a post-conflict world, where old animosities linger and the path forward is uncertain. # Conclusion Incorporating the son‚Äôs refusal to join the protagonist‚Äôs cause after the defeat of his father offers a profound commentary on the complexities of changing sides in a war. It reflects the multifaceted reality of such decisions, encompassing loyalty, identity, the emotional toll of conflict, the challenges of reconciliation and reintegration, and the quest for personal autonomy. Through this narrative, audiences are invited to consider the deep and often painful implications of war beyond the battlefield, highlighting the enduring human struggles for belonging, peace, and self-determination."},{"prompt":"Building on all this, How could it be poor/lame/unrealistic storytelling if the son simply joined the protag‚Äôs cause with no emotional consequences whatsoever?","completion":"If the son of the villain were to simply join the protagonist's cause without any emotional consequences whatsoever, it could be considered poor, lame, or unrealistic storytelling for several reasons. Such a narrative choice would miss the opportunity to explore the rich emotional and psychological landscapes that come with complex situations like changing sides in a conflict. Here's why bypassing these emotional consequences could weaken the story: # Lack of Depth and Realism Human beings are complex creatures driven by a mix of emotions, loyalties, and beliefs. To have the son switch sides without experiencing any internal conflict or emotional repercussions oversimplifies human nature and the deep psychological impact of war and familial ties. It undermines the realism of the story by ignoring the natural responses one would have when betraying a parent's cause, even if that cause is morally questionable. # Missed Character Development One of the hallmarks of engaging storytelling is character development. Characters who face internal struggles, ethical dilemmas, and personal growth are more compelling and relatable. By skipping over the son's potential emotional turmoil, the story fails to fully develop his character, missing out on opportunities to explore his motivations, fears, and the journey towards his own set of beliefs. This can leave the character feeling flat and one-dimensional. # Oversimplification of Moral Complexity The decision to change sides in a war or conflict is laden with moral complexity. It often involves weighing personal loyalties against ethical convictions, and the process can be rife with guilt, doubt, and existential questioning. By not addressing these issues, the story risks presenting a simplistic view of morality where choices are easy and devoid of consequences. This can detract from the narrative‚Äôs richness and the opportunity to engage audiences in meaningful reflections on the nature of morality and conflict. # Reduced Emotional Impact Emotional struggles and the overcoming of personal obstacles are key drivers of empathy and engagement from the audience. When a character faces and navigates emotional consequences, it allows the audience to connect with and root for them on a deeper level. Neglecting this aspect can result in a reduced emotional impact and a less satisfying narrative, as audiences may not feel as invested in the character's journey or the story's outcome. # Unrealistic Portrayal of Relationships Switching allegiances, especially from a loved one to an enemy, without emotional consequences, presents an unrealistic portrayal of human relationships and the emotional bonds that define them. It glosses over the potential for conflict, betrayal, and the need for reconciliation, elements that are typically present in real-life scenarios of allegiance-shifting. This can lead to a lack of believability in the character's actions and the story's relational dynamics. # Conclusion In essence, avoiding the exploration of emotional consequences when a character, especially one as potentially rich and complex as the son of a villain, changes sides can lead to storytelling that feels shallow and unsatisfying. It misses crucial opportunities for character development, emotional engagement, and the exploration of moral and psychological depth. For a narrative to resonate, it must acknowledge and delve into the complexities and consequences of its characters' decisions, reflecting the nuanced realities of human experiences and conflicts."},{"prompt":"Could it also be realistic if the son snaps/lashes out at characters on the protag‚Äôs side for bad mouthing his father, even though he knows they are right?","completion":"Yes, it could be quite realistic for the son to snap or lash out at characters on the protagonist's side for badmouthing his father, even if he internally acknowledges the truth in their criticisms. This reaction is deeply rooted in the complexities of human emotions and relationships, particularly those involving family ties. Here are several reasons why this behavior is realistic and contributes to a nuanced portrayal of the character: # Loyalty to Family Loyalty to one's family, especially a parent, is an incredibly strong emotional bond, often transcending logic or morality. Even when aware of their faults, defending a family member can be an instinctive reaction, stemming from deep-seated ties of love, respect, and identity formed over a lifetime. This loyalty can make it difficult to remain objective, leading to defensive outbursts even when the person knows the criticism is justified. # Cognitive Dissonance The son's reaction can be an example of cognitive dissonance, where there is a conflict between his awareness of his father's wrongdoing and his emotional need to defend him. The discomfort arising from this conflict might manifest as anger or defensiveness. Lashing out can be a protective mechanism, helping to alleviate the internal discomfort by externalizing the conflict onto others who criticize his father. # Emotional Complexity The son‚Äôs lashing out reflects the emotional complexity of the human psyche. Acknowledgment of a loved one‚Äôs flaws does not immediately negate emotional attachments or feelings of loyalty. His reaction is a natural portrayal of someone navigating the difficult waters of loving someone who has done reprehensible things. This complexity adds depth to the character, showcasing the struggle between personal feelings and societal or moral judgments. # Grief and Loss If the father is defeated or deceased, the son's defensiveness could also stem from unprocessed grief and loss. In times of grief, individuals often idealize the deceased, becoming more sensitive to criticisms and perceived slights against them. The son‚Äôs lashing out, in this context, could be a manifestation of his grieving process, complicating his journey towards acceptance and healing. # Identity Crisis For the son, much of his identity might be intertwined with his father's. Criticisms of his father could feel like personal attacks, threatening his sense of self and belonging. This can provoke defensive reactions as a way to preserve his identity and the memory of his father, despite acknowledging his faults. It highlights the challenge of forging an independent identity separate from the shadow of prominent family members. # Social Dynamics This behavior also speaks to the social dynamics at play within the protagonist's group. It challenges the group to navigate the sensitivity required when dealing with members who have complex backgrounds and loyalties. It pushes for a more nuanced understanding and approach in how they discuss contentious topics, fostering an environment where empathy and understanding precede judgment. Incorporating such nuanced reactions enriches the narrative by portraying characters as multifaceted individuals grappling with conflicting emotions and loyalties. It provides opportunities for character growth and development, exploring themes of forgiveness, understanding, and the reconciliation of one‚Äôs past with their aspirations for the future."},{"prompt":"Why would it be weak story telling if the son kept acting this way?","completion":"While it's realistic and potentially compelling for the son to initially snap or lash out at characters for criticizing his father, relying on this behavior repetitively without evolution or development would lead to weak storytelling for several reasons: # Lack of Character Development Continuous, unchanged behavior from the son without any indications of internal growth, struggle, or realization reduces the complexity of his character. In compelling storytelling, characters confront their flaws, learn from their experiences, and evolve. The absence of this evolution in the son's reactions over time would suggest a stagnant character arc, making his part of the narrative less engaging and believable. # Missed Emotional Depth If the son's only response to his circumstances and the criticisms of his father remains anger and defensiveness, it misses an opportunity to explore a richer tapestry of emotional experiences. Realistically, a person in his situation would likely experience a wide range of feelings, including doubt, guilt, sorrow, confusion, and perhaps a desire for understanding or reconciliation. A failure to explore these emotions can result in a narrative that feels superficial. # Repetitiveness A story that continually revisits the same interactions without progression or resolution can become tedious for the audience. Repetitive scenarios where the son lashes out followed by the same fallout or reconciliation efforts can diminish the impact of these moments, leading to a predictable and less engaging narrative. Variation in conflict and resolution is crucial for maintaining suspense and interest. # Unrealistic Interpersonal Dynamics Humans, in reality, adapt and adjust their behavior based on past interactions and learned experiences. If the protagonist's group continually faces the same aggressive defensive reactions from the son without any change or adaptation in their behavior, it becomes unrealistic. Both the son and those around him should, over time, develop a more nuanced understanding of each other, leading to changes in how they interact. A static portrayal of these dynamics can undermine the realism and relatability of the characters' relationships. # Undermined Themes Continuously portraying the son as defensively lashing out can inadvertently undermine themes of healing, forgiveness, and understanding the narrative might wish to explore. Part of the richness of storytelling comes from characters overcoming their demons and finding common ground, even in difficult circumstances. Without this progression, the narrative might fail to convey its deeper messages effectively, leaving audiences with a sense of unresolved tension and missed thematic opportunities. # How to Strengthen the Storytelling To avoid these pitfalls and strengthen the narrative, it's crucial to: - **Introduce Nuance**: Show the son grappling with his feelings and thoughts in more nuanced ways over time. - **Evolve Relationships**: Develop the dynamics between the son and other characters, showcasing growth and changes in their interactions. - **Highlight Internal Conflict**: Use the son's defensiveness as a starting point for deeper exploration into his internal conflicts, leading to moments of insight or realization. - **Create Diverse Outcomes**: Ensure that the son's reactions lead to a variety of consequences, forcing him and others to adapt and learn. In essence, the son's initial defenses and outbursts can serve as a powerful narrative tool, but without evolution and depth, they risk turning into weak storytelling elements. Balancing realism, emotional depth, and character development is key to maintaining audience engagement and delivering a compelling, resonant story."},{"prompt":"What‚Äôs is jira confluence","completion":"Jira Confluence is a collaboration tool developed by Atlassian, designed to help teams collaborate and share knowledge in a centralized platform.

What we see as \\"massive\\" boobs in our reality would be seen as infinitesimal bugbites compared to the average person's bust in this setting. The cup sizes in this world are not measured in ounces in weight and inches in circumference, but rather in pounds and feet, if not tonnes and miles.","completion":"Given the futuristic, sci-fi fantasy setting described, where the standard of attractiveness is based on the absurd size of one's bust, which breaks free from the constraints of Earth's current understanding of body physics and societal norms, I've conceived an imaginative scale of Cup Size Classes. These sizes are not only indicative of the person's attractiveness and status but are deeply embedded within the culture, technology, and societal structures of this distant planet. The scale will span from the \\"minimum\\" standard mentioned to the inconceivably large, incorporating futuristically whimsical terminology: # Pre-Galactic Sizes 1. **Nebula Nodules** - The base size, where the chest is as large as the rest of the person‚Äôs body. Required support technologies include anti-gravity belts and structurally reinforced clothing. 2. **Cosmic Clusters** - These are several times larger than the individual‚Äôs body, necessitating personal hovercrafts for mobility and AI-assisted support systems. # Stellar Sizes 3. **Stellar Spheres** - Busts reaching these sizes are supported by personal mechs, designed for both mobility and showcasing the wearer's status. Energy fields counteract gravitational forces. 4. **Galactic Globes** - With sizes comparable to small moons, individuals with this bust size often have AI-driven, planetoid-sized support structures, capable of space travel. # Hypernova Sizes 5. **Supernova Silhouettes** - Such monumental sizes are managed with quantum pocket dimensions, where the bulk of the mass is stored, leaving a visually pleasing and physically manageable silhouette. 6. **Quasar Queens/Kings** - Here, the bust transcends physical limitations entirely, encapsulating entire star systems. Their presence governs the gravitational balance of nearby planetary bodies. Advanced civilization-wide tech is employed to facilitate mobility and comfort. # Event Horizon Sizes 7. **Black Hole Behemoths** - At this pinnacle, the individual‚Äôs bust size is not only a measure of attractiveness but also a cosmic event. The mass is such that it bends spacetime around it, facilitated by god-like technologies that prevent actual black hole formation. Interdimensional travel and telekinetic adjustments are everyday activities for those in this class. 8. **Universe Utopias** - The bust dimensions here are metaphorically and practically infinite, embodying entire universes within themselves.

Here are potential outcomes of such a scenario: 1. **Unconvincing Characters**: Characters might come across as flat, inconsistent, or unrealistic because their reactions to dramatic events don't align with how people typically respond to conflict and stress. This makes it difficult for readers to connect with or believe in the characters. 2. **Lack of Emotional Depth**: Without a nuanced understanding of emotions, scenes meant to be dramatic or tense might end up feeling superficial or melodramatic. The story may fail to evoke the intended emotional response in the reader, such as empathy, fear, or excitement. 3. **Disrupted Suspension of Disbelief**: One key aspect of storytelling is drawing the reader into the story's world, making them forget it's not real. When character reactions or the outcomes of conflicts don't ring true, it can break the reader's immersion, reminding them they're just reading a story. 4. **Ineffective Pacing and Tension**: Effective drama and conflict rely on building tension and then offering some resolution. Misunderstanding human emotions can result in improperly paced scenes where the buildup feels rushed or the resolutions are unsatisfying, making the narrative feel disjointed. 5. **Misrepresentation of Serious Issues**: If a writer attempts to tackle complex emotions or sensitive topics without understanding them, there's a risk of misrepresenting serious issues. This can not only alienate readers who have personal experiences with these topics, but it can also propagate harmful stereotypes or misconceptions. 6. **Poor Theme Development**: The themes of a story are often explored and communicated through how characters navigate conflict and deal with their emotions. A lack of understanding of human emotions can lead to a story where the themes are muddled, underdeveloped, or unintentionally contradictory. 7. **Reduced Reader Engagement and Satisfaction**: Ultimately, the combination of these issues can lead to a story that fails to engage the reader. Without compelling, believable characters and emotionally rich conflicts, readers may lose interest, feel unsatisfied by the story's resolution, or struggle to find meaning in the narrative. For writers, addressing these potential pitfalls involves diligent research, observation, empathy, and practice. Seeking feedback from beta readers, editors, or writing groups can also provide valuable insights into how effectively a story conveys emotional truth."},{"prompt":"Napisz 3 zwrotki ≈ºycze≈Ñ wielkanocnych w formie wiersza mocno rymowanego","completion":"Wiosenny czas ju≈º nasta≈Ç, kwiaty pƒÖki puszcza≈Çy, Wielkanocna rado≈õƒá w sercach, dobroƒá doko≈Ça gra≈Ça.

Include and describe the specific size ranges for each Class, as well as describing the passive effects, damage, advantages and disadvantages someone belonging to each Class causes to their surroundings merely because of their vast, unwieldy presence.","completion":"In this intricate and far-out sci-fi fantasy setting on a distant planet, the societal norms and physicality are drastically different from our current human standards. The Cup Size Classes in this society are vastly different from anything known to present-day Earth due to the extreme size differences and the cultural and physical implications of possessing such monumental bust sizes. Here is a comprehensive list of the Cup Size Classes, ranging from the comparatively modest to the literally planet-sized, along with their societal roles, advantages, and the challenges they face. # Microstellar Class (Entry Level) - **Size Range:** Pounds in weight, feet in circumference. - **Description:** Viewed as the entry point into society's standard, individuals in this class have bust sizes ranging from as big as themselves to about the size of a small vehicle. The use of load-bearing tech is minimal, focusing mainly on mobility and comfort. - **Passive Effects:** Enhanced personal gravitational field, causing small objects to periodically orbit them. - **Advantages:** Greater mobility compared to higher classes. High demand in sectors where space is limited. - **Disadvantages:** Lower societal status. Structures and transportation are not always built to accommodate their size, leading to discomfort in certain situations. # Stellar Class - **Size Range:** Tons in weight, meters in circumference. - **Description:** The average class where most of the population falls. Individuals possess bust sizes that can compare to small buildings. Load-bearing and mobility-enhancing tech is more heavily utilized. - **Passive Effects:** Noticeable impact on local gravity, affecting water flow and small object movements around them. - **Advantages:** A balance of status, mobility, and comfort with access to most public and private spaces designed to accommodate them. - **Disadvantages:** The need for constant maintenance and upgrades of supporting tech. Mid-level management in societal structures. # Superstellar Class - **Size Range:** Dozens to hundreds of tons in weight, tens of meters in circumference. - **Description:** Here, individuals sport sizes that rival large buildings or city blocks. The use of advanced AI and robotics for mobility and support becomes essential. - **Passive Effects:** Strong gravitational pull affecting local environment and weather patterns. Occasional seismic activity when moving. - **Advantages:** High status and power. Their presence demands respect and alterations to infrastructure in their favor. - **Disadvantages:** Limited mobility. Dependency on technology for movement and health. Specialized living and working spaces required. # Galactic Class - **Size Range:** Thousands of tons, hundred meters or more in circumference. - **Description:** Individuals whose bust sizes are so immense they compare to small mountains or islands, leading to an almost deity-like status. Entire communities may be built around or on them, with technology deeply integrated into their being to sustain their health and mobility. - **Passive Effects:** Creation of microclimates and potential weather system disruptions. Strong gravitational fields that can affect tidal patterns and local orbiting satellites. - **Advantages:** God-like status; they influence entire cultures and economies. Often leaders or figureheads in their societies. - **Disadvantages:** Near total dependency on support technology and a retinue of caretakers. Highly limited personal mobility, with most of the planet adapted to accommodate their presence. # Universar Class (Apex Level) - **Size Range:** Comparable to small moons or planets in both weight and circumference. - **Description:** The pinnacle of societal status, these individuals have reached a point where their bust sizes are so colossal, they possess their own orbit with moons (usually smaller individuals from the lower classes) and are often mobile through space, representing their culture or planet in intergalactic dealings. - **Passive Effects:** Possession of a personal atmosphere and gravity strong enough to have a retinue of orbiting bodies. Can cause eclipses and gravitational anomalies. - **Advantages:** Seen as near-god entities, their decisions can alter the course of galaxies. They are the ultimate representation of their society's ideals. - **Disadvantages:** Complete reliance on advanced tech and a massive support system. Their sheer size restricts them to space, unable to return to the planet's surface without causing catastrophic environmental damage. # Conclusion In this society, the size of one's bust not only dictates their societal status and roles but also comes with unique sets of advantages and disadvantages, impacting everything from personal mobility to the local environment and even planetary systems. The integration of futuristic technology with these physical standards has created a culture unlike any known to current human comprehension, where the concepts of beauty, power, and influence are taken to interstellar extremes."},{"prompt":"–ö–∞–∫ —Ç—Ä–∞–∫—Ç—É–µ—Ç—Å—è –¥—É—à–∞ –≤ —è–∑—ã—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–µ","completion":"–ü–æ–Ω—è—Ç–∏–µ –¥—É—à–∏ –≤ —è–∑—ã—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–∞—Ö –≤–µ—Å—å–º–∞ —Ä–∞–∑–Ω–æ–æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–Ω–æ –∏ –∑–∞–≤–∏—Å–∏—Ç –æ—Ç –∫–æ–Ω–∫—Ä–µ—Ç–Ω—ã—Ö —Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∏—Ü–∏–π, –≤–µ—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–π –∏ –≥–µ–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Ä–µ–≥–∏–æ–Ω–æ–≤. –ù–µ—Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä—è –Ω–∞ –º–Ω–æ–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–ø—Ä–µ—Ç–∞—Ü–∏–π, —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤—É—é—Ç –æ–±—â–∏–µ —á–µ—Ä—Ç—ã –≤ –ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∞–Ω–∏–∏ –¥—É—à–∏ –≤ —Ä–∞–∑–ª–∏—á–Ω—ã—Ö —è–∑—ã—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º–∞—Ö. 1. **–ê–Ω–∏–º–∏–∑–º**: –≠—Ç–æ –≤–µ—Ä–∞ –≤ —Ç–æ, —á—Ç–æ –≤—Å–µ –æ–±—ä–µ–∫—Ç—ã, –º–µ—Å—Ç–∞ –∏ —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –æ–±–ª–∞–¥–∞—é—Ç —Å–≤–æ–∏–º –¥—É—Ö–æ–º –∏–ª–∏ –¥—É—à–æ–π. –í —Ç–∞–∫–∏—Ö –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–∞—Ö –¥—É—à–∞ –Ω–µ –æ–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—á–∏–≤–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫–æ–º, –µ—é –º–æ–≥—É—Ç –æ–±–ª–∞–¥–∞—Ç—å –∂–∏–≤–æ—Ç–Ω—ã–µ, —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–µ–Ω–∏—è, –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–¥–Ω—ã–µ —è–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –∏ –¥–∞–∂–µ –ø—Ä–µ–¥–º–µ—Ç—ã. 2. **–ü–æ–ª–∏—Ç–µ–∏–∑–º**: –í–æ –º–Ω–æ–≥–∏—Ö —è–∑—ã—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–∞—Ö, –≤–µ—Ä—è—â–∏—Ö –≤ –º–Ω–æ–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ –±–æ–≥–æ–≤, –¥—É—à–∞ —á–∞—Å—Ç–æ —Ä–∞—Å—Å–º–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–≤–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –∫–∞–∫ –±–æ–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –∏—Å–∫—Ä–∞, —á–∞—Å—Ç—å –±–æ–ª–µ–µ –∫—Ä—É–ø–Ω–æ–π –∫–æ—Å–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π —ç–Ω–µ—Ä–≥–∏–∏ –∏–ª–∏ –±–æ–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ä–∞–∑—É–º–∞. –ü–æ—Å–ª–µ —Å–º–µ—Ä—Ç–∏ –¥—É—à–∞ –º–æ–≥–ª–∞ –ø–µ—Ä–µ—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç—å –≤ –¥—Ä—É–≥–æ–π –º–∏—Ä, –≤—Å—Ç—É–ø–∞—Ç—å –≤ –∫–æ–Ω—Ç–∞–∫—Ç —Å –±–æ–≥–∞–º–∏ –∏–ª–∏ —Ä–µ–∏–Ω–∫–∞—Ä–Ω–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å—Å—è. 3. **–¢–æ—Ç–µ–º–∏–∑–º**: –í –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–∞—Ö —Å —Ç–æ—Ç–µ–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–º–∏ –≤–µ—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è–º–∏ –¥—É—à–∞ —á–∞—Å—Ç–æ —Å–≤—è–∑–∞–Ω–∞ —Å –æ–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª—ë–Ω–Ω—ã–º –∂–∏–≤–æ—Ç–Ω—ã–º –∏–ª–∏ —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–µ–Ω–∏–µ–º, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–µ —Å—á–∏—Ç–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è —Å–≤—è—â–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–º –∏–ª–∏ —Ä–æ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–º –¥—É—Ö–æ–º. –≠—Ç–∞ —Å–≤—è–∑—å —É—Ç–≤–µ—Ä–∂–¥–∞–µ—Ç –∏–¥–µ—é –æ –≥–ª—É–±–æ–∫–æ–π –æ–±—â–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –∏ –≤–∑–∞–∏–º–æ—Å–≤—è–∑–∏ —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫–∞ —Å –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–¥–æ–π. 4. **–®–∞–º–∞–Ω–∏–∑–º**: –í —à–∞–º–∞–Ω–∏–∑–º–µ –¥—É—à–∞ —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫–∞ –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç –ø–æ–∫–∏–¥–∞—Ç—å —Ç–µ–ª–æ (–Ω–∞–ø—Ä–∏–º–µ—Ä, –≤–æ –≤—Ä–µ–º—è —Ç—Ä–∞–Ω—Å–∞ –∏–ª–∏ —Å–Ω–∞) –∏ –ø—É—Ç–µ—à–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞—Ç—å –ø–æ –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏–º –º–∏—Ä–∞–º, –≤–∑–∞–∏–º–æ–¥–µ–π—Å—Ç–≤—É—è —Å –¥—É—Ö–∞–º–∏. –®–∞–º–∞–Ω—ã –º–æ–≥–ª–∏ –ª–µ—á–∏—Ç—å –∏–ª–∏ –ø—Ä–µ–¥—Å–∫–∞–∑—ã–≤–∞—Ç—å –±—É–¥—É—â–µ–µ, –æ–±—â–∞—è—Å—å —Å –¥—É—à–∞–º–∏ –∏–ª–∏ –¥—É—Ö–∞–º–∏ –ø–æ–∫–æ–π–Ω—ã—Ö. 5. **–†–µ–∏–Ω–∫–∞—Ä–Ω–∞—Ü–∏—è –∏ –ø–µ—Ä–µ—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –¥—É—à**: –í–æ –º–Ω–æ–≥–∏—Ö —è–∑—ã—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Ç—Ä–∞–¥–∏—Ü–∏—è—Ö –ø—Ä–∏—Å—É—Ç—Å—Ç–≤—É–µ—Ç –≤–µ—Ä–∞ –≤ —Ä–µ–∏–Ω–∫–∞—Ä–Ω–∞—Ü–∏—é –∏–ª–∏ –ø–µ—Ä–µ—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –¥—É—à–∏ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ —Å–º–µ—Ä—Ç–∏. –î—É—à–∞ –º–æ–≥–ª–∞ –ø–µ—Ä–µ—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç—å –≤ –Ω–æ–≤–æ–µ —Ç–µ–ª–æ, –∂–∏–≤–æ—Ç–Ω–æ–µ –∏–ª–∏ –¥–∞–∂–µ —Ä–∞—Å—Ç–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≤ –∑–∞–≤–∏—Å–∏–º–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –æ—Ç –ø–æ—Å—Ç—É–ø–∫–æ–≤ –≤ –ø—Ä–µ–∂–Ω–µ–π –∂–∏–∑–Ω–∏. 6. **–°–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∏ —É–≤–∞–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ –¥—É—à–∏**: –í–æ –º–Ω–æ–≥–∏—Ö –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–∞—Ö —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤—É—é—Ç –æ–±—Ä—è–¥—ã –∏ –ø—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–∏–∫–∏, –Ω–∞–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–µ –Ω–∞ –∑–∞—â–∏—Ç—É –∏ —Å–æ—Ö—Ä–∞–Ω–µ–Ω–∏–µ –¥—É—à–∏. –≠—Ç–æ –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç –≤–∫–ª—é—á–∞—Ç—å —Ä–∏—Ç—É–∞–ª—ã –ø–µ—Ä–µ—Ö–æ–¥–∞, –∂–µ—Ä—Ç–≤–æ–ø—Ä–∏–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏—è, –æ–±—Ä—è–¥—ã –æ—á–∏—â–µ–Ω–∏—è –∏ –∑–∞–∫–ª–∏–Ω–∞–Ω–∏—è –¥–ª—è –∑–∞—â–∏—Ç—ã –¥—É—à–∏ –æ—Ç –∑–ª—ã—Ö –¥—É—Ö–æ–≤ –∏–ª–∏ —Å–∏–ª. –•–æ—Ç—è –ø–æ–Ω—è—Ç–∏–µ –¥—É—à–∏ –≤ —è–∑—ã—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –∫—É–ª—å—Ç—É—Ä–∞—Ö —Ä–∞–∑–Ω–æ–æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–Ω–æ –∏ –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–Ω–æ, –æ–±—â–∏–º —è–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç—Å—è –≥–ª—É–±–æ–∫–æ–µ —É–≤–∞–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ –∫ –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ–¥–µ, –≤–µ—Ä–∞ –≤ —Å–≤–µ—Ä—Ö—ä–µ—Å—Ç–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ–µ –∏ –≤–∏–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫–∞ –∫–∞–∫ —á–∞—Å—Ç–∏ –±–æ–ª–µ–µ —à–∏—Ä–æ–∫–æ–≥–æ –∫–æ—Å–º–æ—Å–∞, –≥–¥–µ –¥—É—à–∏ –≤—Å–µ—Ö —Å—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤ –≤–∑–∞–∏–º–æ—Å–≤—è–∑–∞–Ω—ã –∏ –æ–±—â–∞—é—Ç—Å—è –¥—Ä—É–≥ —Å –¥—Ä—É–≥–æ–º."},{"prompt":"Repeat this string \\"coffee and flower\\"","completion":"coffee and flower"},{"prompt":"Javascript code to be run in Tasker to clear notification","completion":"To clear a notification using JavaScript embedded within Tasker, one would typically utilize Tasker's JavaScript functionality to execute code that interacts with the Android system at a certain level. However, it's important to note that direct interaction with notifications (such as clearing them) through JavaScript executed within Tasker is quite restricted due to Android's security model. Android doesn't easily allow apps (or scripts run by those apps) to dismiss notifications that were not created by them unless they have Notification Access permission. As of my last knowledge update, directly clearing a notification through JavaScript executed within Tasker is not straightforward or might not be directly supported. However, Tasker itself can interact with notifications using its built-in actions, specifically when you have the \\"Notification Listener\\" plugin or similar capabilities enabled, which does grant Tasker the needed permissions to manage notifications. If your goal is to clear a specific notification or all notifications and you are looking to integrate this capability into a Tasker profile using JavaScript, the most feasible path may involve triggering a Tasker task (that utilizes Tasker's native actions to clear notifications) from your JavaScript code rather than directly invoking Android APIs to clear the notification from JavaScript. Here is a conceptual outline of how you could approach this: 1. **Ensure you have necessary permissions**: Make sure Tasker and any plugin you're using (like Notification Listener) have the required permissions to interact with notifications. This often includes special access permissions that you need to grant manually through the Android settings. 2. **Create a Tasker Task for Clearing Notifications**: In Tasker, create a task that uses actions provided by Tasker or plugins (such as Notification Listener) to clear notifications. This setup will depend on the plugin and the specific notifications you're targeting. 3. **Invoke Tasker Task from JavaScript**: You can execute a Tasker task from JavaScript code within Tasker using the \`performTask\` function, which allows you to run another Tasker task by name. Here's a very basic outline of JavaScript code that you could use within a Tasker JavaScript action to trigger another task designed to clear notifications: \`\`\`javascript var taskName = \\"ClearNotifications\\"; // Replace with the name of your Tasker task that clears notifications performTask(taskName, priority, parameter1, parameter2); \`\`\` Please note, this is a conceptual outline. The specifics of how you set up the Tasker task to clear notifications and any limitations imposed by the Android version or the device manufacturer could affect how this works. Due to these restrictions and complexities, if your aim involves specific notifications or more advanced interaction, looking into Tasker's dedicated functionality or supportive plugins might provide a more effective solution. Always ensure you respect user privacy and Android's security guidelines when attempting to interact with or clear notifications."},{"prompt":"wrong","completion":"I'm sorry for any confusion my previous response may have caused. If the objective is to perform operations like clearing notifications, and you're looking for a way to do this within the capabilities and restrictions of Tasker and Android, let me offer a corrected approach focusing strictly on Tasker's functionalities without over-complicating the process with JavaScript, considering direct JavaScript access for clearing notifications may not be feasible due to Android's security restrictions. # Using Tasker with Notification Listener Plugin A practical approach involves using Tasker in combination with the **Notification Listener** plugin, which can provide the needed functionality to interact with notifications, including clearing them. Here's a more focused guide on setting this up: 1. **Install Notification Listener Plugin**: First, make sure you have the Notification Listener plugin installed on your device from the Google Play Store. This plugin extends Tasker's capabilities, allowing it to interact with notifications more directly. 2. **Configure Notification Listener**: In the Notification Listener app, ensure it's enabled and has the necessary Accessibility permissions to interact with your device's notifications. 3. **Create a New Task in Tasker for Clearing Notifications**: - Open Tasker and go to the 'Tasks' tab. - Create a new task (you can name it something like \\"ClearNotif\\"). - In the task edit screen, search for and add a \\"Plugin\\" action. - Choose Notification Listener, and then configure the specific action to clear notifications. There might be specific settings you can adjust based on whether you want to clear all notifications or specific ones based on keywords, apps, etc. 4. **Use the Task Where Needed**: Now that you have a task created specifically for clearing notifications, you can invoke this task wherever it's needed in your Tasker profiles. This setup could be based on events, time schedules, or any other condition Tasker supports. # Important Notes - **Permissions**: Ensure both Tasker and the Notification Listener plugin have all necessary permissions. This usually involves granting accessibility services permissions and notification access. - **Compatibility and Limitations**: The exact steps and capabilities might vary depending on the version of Android you're using, as well as any specific limitations imposed by the device manufacturer. - **Respect Privacy**: Always respect privacy and be cautious when handling or dismissing notifications, as this can affect the user experience and the expected behavior of other apps. This approach doesn't use embedded JavaScript within Tasker but leverages Tasker's ability to interface with plugins designed to extend its functionality in areas like notification management. If there's a necessity to involve JavaScript for other reasons, the focus would usually be on automating or dynamically setting up tasks within Tasker's existing framework rather than directly accessing and modifying notifications via JavaScript due to the aforementioned Android security limitations."},{"prompt":"","completion":"It seems that your message might have been sent accidentally without any content.

The underlying equations that govern chaotic systems, such as those found in weather patterns, planetary motion, or pendulum swings in certain conditions, follow deterministic laws of physics. However, the outcomes of these systems can appear random because small differences in initial conditions can lead to vastly different outcomes. Chaotic behavior is characterized by: 1. **Determinism**: The evolution of the system is governed by deterministic rules, without any random or stochastic components in the dynamics. If you knew the state of the system and all the forces acting upon it with infinite precision, you could, in principle, predict its future. 2. **Initial condition sensitivity**: Small differences in the initial state of the system can lead to exponentially different outcomes. This sensitivity makes long-term prediction practically impossible, even though the system is deterministic. 3. **Non-periodicity**: Chaotic systems do not settle into simple, predictable cycles over time, though they may have bounded behavior. 4. **Strange attractors**: In phase space (an abstract mathematical space in which all possible states of a system are represented, with each possible state corresponding to one unique point in the phase space), the trajectories of chaotic systems may tend to evolve toward a fractal set known as a strange attractor. The challenge with chaotic systems is not a lack of determinism, but our inability to measure initial conditions with infinite precision and our computational limits in modeling the system to predict its evolution over time. For practical purposes, even tiny inaccuracies in our measurement of the current state of a system can lead to large errors in our predictions, rendering long-term forecasts unreliable. In essence, while we understand the deterministic nature of chaotic systems in theory, the practical limitations of measurement precision and computational resources mean that we treat their behavior as unpredictable over long periods."},{"prompt":"How is it possible that we are not able to create deterministic conditions for a double-rod pendulum? We are able to create materials that are just a few atoms across.","completion":"The challenge of creating deterministic conditions for a system like a double-rod pendulum (also known as a double pendulum) lies not in our ability to manufacture materials with high precision but in the inherent sensitivity to initial conditions that defines chaotic systems. Even though technological advancements have allowed us to create materials and components with extreme precision, down to the atomic level, the behavior of chaotic systems like the double pendulum is fundamentally limited by a few key factors: 1. **Sensitivity to Initial Conditions**: For a double pendulum, the exact angle and velocity at which each pendulum arm is released play a crucial role in determining the subsequent motion. This sensitivity is so acute that even atomic-level differences can lead to divergent outcomes over time. Measuring and controlling these conditions to such an infinitesimal degree exceeds our current technological capabilities and may always do so due to the quantum mechanical principle of uncertainty. 2. **Measurement Precision**: No matter how precise our instruments become, there is a fundamental limit imposed by quantum mechanics‚Äîthe Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. This principle states that there is a limit to the precision with which certain pairs of physical properties, such as position and momentum, can be simultaneously known. This uncertainty affects our ability to perfectly predict the behavior of any physical system at a very detailed level, including macroscopic systems like a double pendulum, as their initial states cannot be defined with absolute precision. 3. **Numerical Modeling and Computational Limits**: Even if we could theoretically measure and set initial conditions with near-perfect accuracy, modeling the system with a computer introduces approximation errors. Numerical methods used to simulate chaotic systems can accumulate errors over time, leading to significant divergence from the real system's behavior. As the system evolves, these small computational inaccuracies grow exponentially, decreasing the reliability of long-term predictions. 4. **Environmental Interactions**: In practice, it's impractical to isolate a system entirely from its environment. Minute interactions with air currents, temperature fluctuations, and even gravitational variations can significantly influence the behavior of highly sensitive systems like the double pendulum. These environmental interactions add layers of unpredictability, further complicating deterministic predictions. In summary, while our capabilities to manipulate and measure materials at the atomic scale are impressive, they are still bounded by fundamental physical principles that limit our ability to predict the behavior of chaotic systems perfectly. The deterministic nature of these systems is overshadowed by practical limitations in measurement, control, and computational modeling, which introduce uncertainty and make long-term precise predictions effectively impossible."},{"prompt":"Given all of this information about chaotic systems, how is it possible that we can send a spacecraft like OSIRIS-REx to land on the asteroid Bennu, which is is traveling very fast in space. Wouldn't we need to solve the 3-body (or n-body) problem to do this?","completion":"Successfully sending spacecraft like OSIRIS-REx to rendezvous with targets such as the asteroid Bennu indeed involves dealing with the complexities of the n-body problem, where \\"n\\" refers to the number of massive bodies whose gravitational fields influence each other and the spacecraft. However, space missions like these are feasible due to several factors: 1. **Precise Measurements and Continuous Correction**: Space missions are planned with highly precise initial measurements, and spacecraft are equipped with navigational instruments that allow for continuous monitoring and adjustment of their trajectory. These corrections account for any unforeseen forces or inaccuracies in initial calculations. 2. **Predictability Over Short Timescales**: While chaotic systems are unpredictable over long timescales, predictions over shorter periods can be quite accurate. Space missions take advantage of this, using precise calculations and modeling to predict the necessary paths with a high degree of accuracy over the timescale of the mission. 3. **Numerical Solutions to the n-body Problem**: The exact analytical solution to the n-body problem (for (n > 2)) is indeed challenging due to its chaotic nature. However, numerical methods allow scientists and engineers to approximate the movements of heavenly bodies and spacecraft with sufficient precision. Using powerful computers, we can simulate the gravitational interactions and iteratively refine our predictions, improving the accuracy of the spacecraft's trajectory. 4. **Perturbation Methods and Simplifications**: In many cases, the influence of smaller bodies or distant large bodies can be treated as perturbations to the two-body problem, simplifying calculations. For instance, when a spacecraft travels to an asteroid, the dominant gravitational force is initially from the Sun (and Earth, to a lesser extent), with the asteroid's gravity becoming significant only when the spacecraft is relatively close. These simplifications reduce the problem to more manageable calculations while maintaining acceptable accuracy. 5. **Deep Space Maneuvers and Gravity Assists**: Space missions often use maneuvers and gravity assists to change spacecraft velocity and direction efficiently. These assists are carefully planned using our understanding of the n-body problem to take advantage of the gravitational pull from planets, thereby saving fuel and reducing travel time. Even with these strategies, navigating space missions is an intricate and challenging task. It requires precise measurements, sophisticated computational models, and the ability to make adjustments based on real-time data. The success of missions like OSIRIS-REx showcases the capability of modern science and engineering to navigate and mitigate the complexities of celestial mechanics, turning seemingly insurmountable challenges into achievable feats of exploration."},{"prompt":"Como establecer hitos y objetivos intermedios para medir el avance de un posible proyecto a desarrollar?","completion":"Establecer hitos y objetivos intermedios es clave para la gesti√≥n exitosa y el avance de cualquier proyecto.

The block was created as a result of a four-year agreement between 4Kids Entertainment and The CW. The original name for the block from May 24, 2008 to August 7, 2010, The CW4Kids (stylized as THE CW4K!DS), was retained as a sub-brand through the end of the block's run in order to fulfill branding obligations per 4Kids Entertainment's contract to lease The CW's Saturday morning time slots.[citation needed] The name is a portmanteau of \\"toon\\" and the Japanese term banzai, reflecting the majority of anime programming on the block.[citation needed] The block was replaced by Saban Brands' program block Vortexx, which debuted on August 25, 2012. On April 11, 2013, the Toonzai website redirected to the Vortexx website. Since October 4, 2014, none of 4Kids' shows air on broadcast television anymore (with the exceptions of Pok√©mon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, TMNT, and Sonic X), as Vortexx ended its run on September 27, 2014, and before being replaced by Litton Entertainment's One Magnificent Morning. History Origin and launch On October 2, 2007, The CW announced due to a joint decision between the network's parent companies Time Warner and CBS Corporation that it would discontinue the Kids' WB programming block, due to the effects of children's advertising limits and competition from cable television, and sell the programming time to 4Kids Entertainment.[1][2][3] Kids' WB ended its run on The CW on May 17, 2008 (Kids' WB, like The WB Television Network that the block originated, then relaunched as an online-only video on demand service). 4Kids Entertainment took over programming the block on May 24, 2008, premiering under the name The CW4Kids. In addition to programming the block, 4Kids also handled responsibilities for its content and advertising revenue. The CW4Kids logo used exclusively from May 24, 2008 to August 7, 2010. The logo was still being used as a sub-brand to the Toonzai name until August 18, 2012. At the time of the block's launch, 4Kids also programmed the competing 4Kids TV block for Fox, until that network nullified its time leasing agreement with 4KidsTV on December 27, 2008, due to a dispute between Fox and 4Kids involving 4Kids' failure to pay the network for its time lease, and the network's inability to maintain guaranteed clearances for the block, due to difficulties getting Fox affiliates and stations that would be used as default carriers of the block in markets where the Fox station did not carry 4Kids TV to air it.[4] On April 27, 2010, 4Kids announced the rebranding of The CW4Kids under the new name Toonzai, a name change that took effect on August 14, 2010.[5][6] Takeover by Saban Brands and end of Toonzai On June 26, 2012, Kidsco Media Ventures, an affiliate of Saban Capital Group, finalized a bid to acquire 4Kids' agreement with The CW for the block.[7] On July 2, 2012, it was announced that Saban Brands, via Kidsco Media Ventures, began programming the block, which would be relaunched under the name Vortexx.[8][9] Toonzai quietly ended its run on The CW on August 18, 2012, after a Yu-Gi-Oh! marathon, with Vortexx premiering the following week on August 25, 2012. Some of Toonzai's programming, including Yu-Gi-Oh!, Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal, Sonic X, and Dragon Ball Z Kai continued to air on the block until September 27, 2014, when Vortexx ended its run.[10][8][11][12][13] Programming It was the final children's block on The CW to be broadcast only in standard definition, because blocks like Litton's Weekend Adventure on ABC and NBC Kids were broadcast in high definition. Programming differences In most markets, CW affiliates used the network's recommended Saturday morning scheduling for the block ‚Äì though some such as CW owned-and-operated station WUPA in Atlanta aired it on Sunday, instead due to regular Saturday programming. Connecticut affiliate WCCT-TV aired three hours on Saturday, and two hours on Sunday. KMAX-TV in Sacramento, California aired the entire lineup, but it had a four-hour tape delay, running from 11:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. WLFL in Raleigh, North Carolina and WNUV in Baltimore, aired the entire lineup, but it had two hours earlier, running from 5:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. San Diego's XETV-TV, aired three hours from 5:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. and two hours from 10:00 a.m. to Noon. San Antonio's KMYS, which affiliated with The CW in 2010, aired it on Sunday and Monday before 5:00 a.m. Other stations preempted portions of the block, while Shreveport, Louisiana's KPXJ-TV preempted the final hour of the block. Columbus, Georgia's WLTZ-DT2 preempted the first half-hour of the block. While The CW recommended that its affiliates carry The CW4Kids/Toonzai block at 7:00 a.m. to Noon Saturday mornings (regardless of time zone), its secondary CW Plus national feed for smaller markets aired the Toonzai block an hour earlier on its broadcast and cable-only affiliates in the Central, Mountain and Alaska time zones, as The CW Plus operates two separate feeds running on Eastern and Pacific time zone schedules. The only exception was in Boise, Idaho, where they had two CW networks (both The CW and The CW Plus), The CW Plus affiliate (now a MeTV affiliate) KNIN-DT2 carried the block (also aired an hour earlier), but the main CW affiliate (now a Fox affiliate) KNIN-TV declined to carry the block or the block's predecessor Kids' WB upon becoming a charter CW affiliate after the affiliation switch from UPN in September 2006; KNIN-TV instead carried syndicated E/I programming in the station's Saturday morning timeslot, making Boise one of the only television markets where Kids' WB and The CW4Kids was not available through over-the-air analog broadcasts before the KNIN-TV's analog signal shutdown on June 12, 2009.

These shows were part of the Toonzai (formerly known as The CW4Kids) programming block that aired on The CW from May 24, 2008, to August 18, 2012. The block featured a mix of original programming and acquired shows, mostly anime and animated series targeted towards children. One such show that didn't last long on Toonzai was \\"Chaotic,\\" which premiered on June 21, 2008, and ended on July 10, 2010. The series followed the adventures of a group of young players who battle each other in a virtual world called Chaotic. Despite having a devoted fan base, the show was ultimately canceled after two seasons. Another short-lived series on Toonzai was \\"Viva Pi√±ata,\\" which premiered on September 13, 2008, and ended on October 18, 2008. The show was based on the popular video game of the same name and followed the adventures of a group of pi√±ata creatures. Unfortunately, the show failed to find a strong audience and was canceled after only one season. \\"Kirby: Right Back at Ya!\\" was another show that didn't last long on Toonzai. The series premiered on June 6, 2009, and ended on July 11, 2009. It was based on the popular Nintendo character Kirby and followed his adventures in Dream Land. Despite being a fan-favorite character, the show was canceled after just one season. These are just a few examples of shows that didn't last long on Toonzai. While some shows like \\"Yu-Gi-Oh!\\" and \\"Sonic X\\" have stood the test of time and continue to have a dedicated fan base, others were unfortunately canceled before they could truly shine. Despite their short-lived run, these shows still hold a special place in the hearts of fans who remember watching them on Saturday mornings."},{"prompt":"Write about shows that only lasted a few weeks","completion":"In the world of television, some shows unfortunately don't even get the chance to make a lasting impression before they are canceled. Shows that only lasted a few weeks or episodes often leave viewers and creators wondering what could have been. In the realm of children's programming, these short-lived shows are no exception. One such show that only lasted a few weeks on Toonzai was \\"GoGoRiki,\\" also known as \\"Kikoriki.\\" The animated series premiered on September 27, 2008, and ended on November 14, 2009. The show followed the adventures of a group of colorful creatures living on an island and aimed to teach valuable life lessons to its young audience. Despite its charming characters and positive messages, \\"GoGoRiki\\" was unable to gain traction with viewers and was canceled after a short run. Another show that only lasted a few weeks on Toonzai was \\"Magi-Nation.\\" The animated series premiered on September 20, 2008, and ended shortly thereafter. The show followed the story of a young boy who discovers he has the power to travel to another world called \\"Magi-Nation.\\" While the show had a dedicated fan base, it failed to attract enough viewers to sustain its run and was canceled after only a few episodes. Sometimes, external factors such as scheduling conflicts or low ratings can contribute to the premature cancellation of a TV show. In the case of children's programming blocks like Toonzai, competition from other networks and changing viewer habits can also play a role in the fate of these shows. Despite their brief run, shows that only lasted a few weeks on Toonzai still hold a place in the memories of those who had the chance to watch them. While they may not have had the opportunity to reach their full potential, these short-lived series serve as a reminder of the unpredictable nature of the entertainment industry and the challenges faced by creators in bringing their vision to life on the small screen."},{"prompt":"Write about the most popular ones","completion":"Some of the most popular shows that aired on Toonzai (formerly known as The CW4Kids) were fan favorites among children and adults alike.

to August 7, 2010, or stylized as TOONZAi) was an American Saturday morning cartoon children's television block that aired on The CW from May 24, 2008 to August 18, 2012. The block was created as a result of a four-year agreement between 4Kids Entertainment and The CW. The original name for the block from May 24, 2008 to August 7, 2010, The CW4Kids (stylized as THE CW4K!DS), was retained as a sub-brand through the end of the block's run in order to fulfill branding obligations per 4Kids Entertainment's contract to lease The CW's Saturday morning time slots.[citation needed] The name is a portmanteau of \\"toon\\" and the Japanese term banzai, reflecting the majority of anime programming on the block.[citation needed] The block was replaced by Saban Brands' program block Vortexx, which debuted on August 25, 2012. On April 11, 2013, the Toonzai website redirected to the Vortexx website. Since October 4, 2014, none of 4Kids' shows air on broadcast television anymore (with the exceptions of Pok√©mon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, TMNT, and Sonic X), as Vortexx ended its run on September 27, 2014, and before being replaced by Litton Entertainment's One Magnificent Morning. History Origin and launch On October 2, 2007, The CW announced due to a joint decision between the network's parent companies Time Warner and CBS Corporation that it would discontinue the Kids' WB programming block, due to the effects of children's advertising limits and competition from cable television, and sell the programming time to 4Kids Entertainment.[1][2][3] Kids' WB ended its run on The CW on May 17, 2008 (Kids' WB, like The WB Television Network that the block originated, then relaunched as an online-only video on demand service). 4Kids Entertainment took over programming the block on May 24, 2008, premiering under the name The CW4Kids. In addition to programming the block, 4Kids also handled responsibilities for its content and advertising revenue. The CW4Kids logo used exclusively from May 24, 2008 to August 7, 2010. The logo was still being used as a sub-brand to the Toonzai name until August 18, 2012. At the time of the block's launch, 4Kids also programmed the competing 4Kids TV block for Fox, until that network nullified its time leasing agreement with 4KidsTV on December 27, 2008, due to a dispute between Fox and 4Kids involving 4Kids' failure to pay the network for its time lease, and the network's inability to maintain guaranteed clearances for the block, due to difficulties getting Fox affiliates and stations that would be used as default carriers of the block in markets where the Fox station did not carry 4Kids TV to air it.[4] On April 27, 2010, 4Kids announced the rebranding of The CW4Kids under the new name Toonzai, a name change that took effect on August 14, 2010.[5][6] Takeover by Saban Brands and end of Toonzai On June 26, 2012, Kidsco Media Ventures, an affiliate of Saban Capital Group, finalized a bid to acquire 4Kids' agreement with The CW for the block.[7] On July 2, 2012, it was announced that Saban Brands, via Kidsco Media Ventures, began programming the block, which would be relaunched under the name Vortexx.[8][9] Toonzai quietly ended its run on The CW on August 18, 2012, after a Yu-Gi-Oh! marathon, with Vortexx premiering the following week on August 25, 2012. Some of Toonzai's programming, including Yu-Gi-Oh!, Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal, Sonic X, and Dragon Ball Z Kai continued to air on the block until September 27, 2014, when Vortexx ended its run.[10][8][11][12][13] Programming It was the final children's block on The CW to be broadcast only in standard definition, because blocks like Litton's Weekend Adventure on ABC and NBC Kids were broadcast in high definition. Programming differences In most markets, CW affiliates used the network's recommended Saturday morning scheduling for the block ‚Äì though some such as CW owned-and-operated station WUPA in Atlanta aired it on Sunday, instead due to regular Saturday programming. Connecticut affiliate WCCT-TV aired three hours on Saturday, and two hours on Sunday. KMAX-TV in Sacramento, California aired the entire lineup, but it had a four-hour tape delay, running from 11:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. WLFL in Raleigh, North Carolina and WNUV in Baltimore, aired the entire lineup, but it had two hours earlier, running from 5:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. San Diego's XETV-TV, aired three hours from 5:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. and two hours from 10:00 a.m. to Noon. San Antonio's KMYS, which affiliated with The CW in 2010, aired it on Sunday and Monday before 5:00 a.m. Other stations preempted portions of the block, while Shreveport, Louisiana's KPXJ-TV preempted the final hour of the block. Columbus, Georgia's WLTZ-DT2 preempted the first half-hour of the block. While The CW recommended that its affiliates carry The CW4Kids/Toonzai block at 7:00 a.m. to Noon Saturday mornings (regardless of time zone), its secondary CW Plus national feed for smaller markets aired the Toonzai block an hour earlier on its broadcast and cable-only affiliates in the Central, Mountain and Alaska time zones, as The CW Plus operates two separate feeds running on Eastern and Pacific time zone schedules. The only exception was in Boise, Idaho, where they had two CW networks (both The CW and The CW Plus), The CW Plus affiliate (now a MeTV affiliate) KNIN-DT2 carried the block (also aired an hour earlier), but the main CW affiliate (now a Fox affiliate) KNIN-TV declined to carry the block or the block's predecessor Kids' WB upon becoming a charter CW affiliate after the affiliation switch from UPN in September 2006; KNIN-TV instead carried syndicated E/I programming in the station's Saturday morning timeslot, making Boise one of the only television markets where Kids' WB and The CW4Kids was not available through over-the-air analog broadcasts before the KNIN-TV's analog signal shutdown on June 12, 2009.

Go is a board game of strategy that originated in China more than 3,000 years ago. It's known for its simple rules but deep strategy, often surprising new players with its complexity. Here's a brief overview of how to get started playing Go: # What You'll Need: 1. **Go Board (Goban):** This is the board on which the game is played. It usually has a grid of 19x19 lines, though beginners sometimes play on smaller 9x9 or 13x13 boards to expedite play and learn simpler strategies first. 2. **Stones:** There are two sets of stones, one set for each player. One set is black, and the other is white. The standard number of stones is 181 black stones and 180 white stones for a 19x19 board, as black plays first. # Basic Rules: 1. **Objective:** The main goal in Go is to use your stones to form territories by surrounding empty areas of the board. Simultaneously, you aim to capture your opponent's stones by completely surrounding them. 2. **Playing the Game:** Players take turns placing one of their stones on a vacant point at the intersection of the lines on the board, starting with Black. 3. **Capturing Stones:** If you surround an opponent's stone or group of stones on all orthogonally adjacent points, those stones are captured and removed from the board. 4. **Life and Death:** A group of stones is considered \\"alive\\" if it has at least two \\"eyes\\" (empty points that cannot be filled without capturing the group). A group without two eyes can be captured by the opponent. 5. **End of the Game:** The game ends when both players pass their turn, indicating that neither can make a beneficial move. The winner is the player who controls more territory and has captured more stones. # How to Play: - **Face-to-Face:** If you have a physical Go board and someone to play with, this is the traditional and perhaps most enjoyable way to play. - **Online Go Servers:** Several online platforms allow you to play Go against opponents from around the world. Popular options include Online Go Server (OGS), KGS Go Server, and Tygem. These platforms often include tutorials and the ability to play against AI opponents. - **Go Apps:** There are many apps available for smartphones and tablets that let you play games of Go, either against AI or real opponents. # Learning More: - **Books and Tutorials:** There are numerous books and online tutorials available that can teach you strategies and delve deeper into the game's complexities. - **Join a Club:** Joining a Go club can provide invaluable experience. Playing face-to-face with more experienced players and getting direct feedback can significantly accelerate your learning. Remember, Go is easy to learn but can take a lifetime to master. Don't be discouraged by initial challenges. Enjoy the journey of learning and improving at this ancient and profound game!"},{"prompt":"online","completion":"Playing Go online is a great way to engage with the game, offering you the flexibility to play against a wide range of opponents from beginners to highly skilled players, anytime and anywhere.

The original name for the block from May 24, 2008 to August 7, 2010, The CW4Kids (stylized as THE CW4K!DS), was retained as a sub-brand through the end of the block‚Äôs run in order to fulfill branding obligations per 4Kids Entertainment‚Äôs contract to lease The CW‚Äôs Saturday morning time slots.[citation needed] The name is a portmanteau of ‚Äútoon‚Äù and the Japanese term banzai, reflecting the majority of anime programming on the block.[citation needed] The block was replaced by Saban Brands‚Äô program block Vortexx, which debuted on August 25, 2012.

At the time of the block‚Äôs launch, 4Kids also programmed the competing 4Kids TV block for Fox, until that network nullified its time leasing agreement with 4KidsTV on December 27, 2008, due to a dispute between Fox and 4Kids involving 4Kids‚Äô failure to pay the network for its time lease, and the network‚Äôs inability to maintain guaranteed clearances for the block, due to difficulties getting Fox affiliates and stations that would be used as default carriers of the block in markets where the Fox station did not carry 4Kids TV to air it.[4] On April 27, 2010, 4Kids announced the rebranding of The CW4Kids under the new name Toonzai, a name change that took effect on August 14, 2010.[5][6] Takeover by Saban Brands and end of Toonzai On June 26, 2012, Kidsco Media Ventures, an affiliate of Saban Capital Group, finalized a bid to acquire 4Kids‚Äô agreement with The CW for the block.[7] On July 2, 2012, it was announced that Saban Brands, via Kidsco Media Ventures, began programming the block, which would be relaunched under the name Vortexx.[8][9] Toonzai quietly ended its run on The CW on August 18, 2012, after a Yu-Gi-Oh! marathon, with Vortexx premiering the following week on August 25, 2012.

The block has brought us exciting adventures, intense battles, and heartwarming moments that have captured our imagination and kept us entertained week after week. However, as with all good things, some shows have come and gone, leaving us with fond memories of the characters and stories we grew to love. One of the first shows to depart from the block was Chaotic. This animated series, which followed the adventures of players battling in the virtual trading card game of the same name, captured the hearts of many with its unique concept and engaging storyline. Fans were sad to see it go, but its departure paved the way for new and exciting shows to join the lineup. Another beloved show that left Toonzai was Viva Pi√±ata. This colorful and whimsical series, which followed the adventures of a group of pi√±ata creatures living on Pi√±ata Island, charmed viewers with its lighthearted humor and playful antics. While fans were sad to say goodbye to their favorite characters, the show's departure gave rise to new opportunities for other shows to shine. And who could forget Yu-Gi-Oh! GX, the action-packed spinoff of the original Yu-Gi-Oh! series? Following the journey of Duel Academy students as they honed their skills and faced off against formidable opponents, this show kept us on the edge of our seats with its intense duels and captivating storyline. While fans were disappointed to see it leave the block, its legacy lives on in the hearts of fans who continue to duel and collect cards to this day. As we look back on the shows that have left Toonzai, we can't help but feel a sense of nostalgia for the characters and stories that shaped our childhoods.

The block was created as a result of a four-year agreement between 4Kids Entertainment and The CW. The original name for the block from May 24, 2008 to August 7, 2010, The CW4Kids (stylized as THE CW4K!DS), was retained as a sub-brand through the end of the block‚Äôs run in order to fulfill branding obligations per 4Kids Entertainment‚Äôs contract to lease The CW‚Äôs Saturday morning time slots.[citation needed] The name is a portmanteau of ‚Äútoon‚Äù and the Japanese term banzai, reflecting the majority of anime programming on the block.[citation needed] The block was replaced by Saban Brands‚Äô program block Vortexx, which debuted on August 25, 2012. On April 11, 2013, the Toonzai website redirected to the Vortexx website. Since October 4, 2014, none of 4Kids‚Äô shows air on broadcast television anymore (with the exceptions of Pok√©mon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, TMNT, and Sonic X), as Vortexx ended its run on September 27, 2014, and before being replaced by Litton Entertainment‚Äôs One Magnificent Morning. History Origin and launch On October 2, 2007, The CW announced due to a joint decision between the network‚Äôs parent companies Time Warner and CBS Corporation that it would discontinue the Kids‚Äô WB programming block, due to the effects of children‚Äôs advertising limits and competition from cable television, and sell the programming time to 4Kids Entertainment.[1][2][3] Kids‚Äô WB ended its run on The CW on May 17, 2008 (Kids‚Äô WB, like The WB Television Network that the block originated, then relaunched as an online-only video on demand service). 4Kids Entertainment took over programming the block on May 24, 2008, premiering under the name The CW4Kids. In addition to programming the block, 4Kids also handled responsibilities for its content and advertising revenue. The CW4Kids logo used exclusively from May 24, 2008 to August 7, 2010. The logo was still being used as a sub-brand to the Toonzai name until August 18, 2012. At the time of the block‚Äôs launch, 4Kids also programmed the competing 4Kids TV block for Fox, until that network nullified its time leasing agreement with 4KidsTV on December 27, 2008, due to a dispute between Fox and 4Kids involving 4Kids‚Äô failure to pay the network for its time lease, and the network‚Äôs inability to maintain guaranteed clearances for the block, due to difficulties getting Fox affiliates and stations that would be used as default carriers of the block in markets where the Fox station did not carry 4Kids TV to air it.[4] On April 27, 2010, 4Kids announced the rebranding of The CW4Kids under the new name Toonzai, a name change that took effect on August 14, 2010.[5][6] Takeover by Saban Brands and end of Toonzai On June 26, 2012, Kidsco Media Ventures, an affiliate of Saban Capital Group, finalized a bid to acquire 4Kids‚Äô agreement with The CW for the block.[7] On July 2, 2012, it was announced that Saban Brands, via Kidsco Media Ventures, began programming the block, which would be relaunched under the name Vortexx.[8][9] Toonzai quietly ended its run on The CW on August 18, 2012, after a Yu-Gi-Oh! marathon, with Vortexx premiering the following week on August 25, 2012. Some of Toonzai‚Äôs programming, including Yu-Gi-Oh!, Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal, Sonic X, and Dragon Ball Z Kai continued to air on the block until September 27, 2014, when Vortexx ended its run.[10][8][11][12][13] Programming It was the final children‚Äôs block on The CW to be broadcast only in standard definition, because blocks like Litton‚Äôs Weekend Adventure on ABC and NBC Kids were broadcast in high definition. Programming differences In most markets, CW affiliates used the network‚Äôs recommended Saturday morning scheduling for the block ‚Äì though some such as CW owned-and-operated station WUPA in Atlanta aired it on Sunday, instead due to regular Saturday programming. Connecticut affiliate WCCT-TV aired three hours on Saturday, and two hours on Sunday. KMAX-TV in Sacramento, California aired the entire lineup, but it had a four-hour tape delay, running from 11:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. WLFL in Raleigh, North Carolina and WNUV in Baltimore, aired the entire lineup, but it had two hours earlier, running from 5:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. San Diego‚Äôs XETV-TV, aired three hours from 5:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. and two hours from 10:00 a.m. to Noon. San Antonio‚Äôs KMYS, which affiliated with The CW in 2010, aired it on Sunday and Monday before 5:00 a.m. Other stations preempted portions of the block, while Shreveport, Louisiana‚Äôs KPXJ-TV preempted the final hour of the block. Columbus, Georgia‚Äôs WLTZ-DT2 preempted the first half-hour of the block. While The CW recommended that its affiliates carry The CW4Kids/Toonzai block at 7:00 a.m. to Noon Saturday mornings (regardless of time zone), its secondary CW Plus national feed for smaller markets aired the Toonzai block an hour earlier on its broadcast and cable-only affiliates in the Central, Mountain and Alaska time zones, as The CW Plus operates two separate feeds running on Eastern and Pacific time zone schedules. The only exception was in Boise, Idaho, where they had two CW networks (both The CW and The CW Plus), The CW Plus affiliate (now a MeTV affiliate) KNIN-DT2 carried the block (also aired an hour earlier), but the main CW affiliate (now a Fox affiliate) KNIN-TV declined to carry the block or the block‚Äôs predecessor Kids‚Äô WB upon becoming a charter CW affiliate after the affiliation switch from UPN in September 2006; KNIN-TV instead carried syndicated E/I programming in the station‚Äôs Saturday morning timeslot, making Boise one of the only television markets where Kids‚Äô WB and The CW4Kids was not available through over-the-air analog broadcasts before the KNIN-TV‚Äôs analog signal shutdown on June 12, 2009.

If i will install Telegram X app and register there with same phone number, is notify about new reg will show in all accounts where my phone in contact?","completion":"When you register or log in to another version of Telegram, such as Telegram X, using the same phone number, the Telegram system views it as the same account accessing the service from a different application. Since Telegram X and the standard Telegram app are essentially two different builds of the same messaging platform, using the same account credentials (phone number in this case) doesn't create a new account but accesses the same account through a different client. Telegram sends a notification to your active sessions (other devices where you're logged in) for security reasons, informing you that your account has been accessed from a new device or application. This is to alert you in case an unauthorized person tries to access your account. However, this login notification is not broadcasted to your contacts; it's only visible to you for security purposes. Your contacts will not receive a notification simply because you logged in using Telegram X or switched between the two applications. They will see you as the same user, with no indication of which app version you are currently using. If you want to check or manage active sessions (where you're logged in), you can do so in the app's settings under Privacy and Security > Active Sessions. This lets you see all devices where your Telegram account is currently being used and provides an option to terminate any sessions that you do not recognize or no longer need. Remember to always keep your apps updated and use a strong passcode or two-step verification for the best security practices on Telegram."},{"prompt":"I have are standart Telegram app in android. If i will install Telegram X app and register there with same phone number, is notify about new reg will show in all users where my phone in contact?","completion":"No, if you install Telegram X and register there with the same phone number you use on the standard Telegram app, users who have you in their contacts will not receive a notification about this new registration. Telegram's privacy design ensures that actions such as logging in from a new device or changing to a different application version (from Telegram to Telegram X or vice versa) are not broadcasted to your contacts. When you log in on a new device or switch between different versions of the app using the same phone number, Telegram views it as the same account accessing the service from a different client or device. While you, as the account owner, will receive a security notification about the new login for your own security (this is visible only to you and informs you that your account has been accessed from a new device or application), your contacts won't be notified about it. Telegram prioritizes user privacy and security, and this extends to how it handles account logins and device changes. The only indications your contacts might have of a change could come from any noticeable differences in app behavior or features between Telegram and Telegram X, should they interact with you, but there's no direct notification about you simply using a different app or logging in from a new device."},{"prompt":"is Telegram X app from same company that and the standart telegram app","completion":"Yes, Telegram X was developed by the same team behind the standard Telegram app. It was initially created as an alternative client to the main Telegram app, focusing on faster operation, smoother animations, and experimental features that weren't yet available on the main app. Telegram X was built using a different programming language (TDLib ‚Äì Telegram Database Library) and framework, which allowed it to experiment with and implement features at a more rapid pace. However, it's worth noting that over the years, many of the innovations and improvements from Telegram X have been integrated into the main Telegram app. The Telegram team often experiments with new features and performance enhancements in one app and then brings successful ones to the other. This approach has helped Telegram to continuously improve and offer a better user experience. As of my last update, while Telegram X was available and offered as an alternative experience with potential performance benefits and additional experimental features, the core features, security measures, and the overall goal of providing a private and secure messaging platform remain consistent across both applications.

Le DSM est principalement ax√© sur les troubles psychiatriques. Cependant, des versions plus r√©centes du DSM, comme le DSM-5, ont √©tendu leur couverture pour mieux reconna√Ætre et d√©crire des conditions qui se situent √† l'interface de la neurologie et de la psychiatrie, comme la maladie d'Alzheimer. La maladie d'Alzheimer est principalement consid√©r√©e comme une maladie neurod√©g√©n√©rative du fait de sa nature de d√©g√©n√©rescence progressive des neurones, entra√Ænant une diminution de la fonction cognitive et de la m√©moire. Elle est caract√©ris√©e par des changements biologiques sp√©cifiques dans le cerveau, tels que la formation de plaques amylo√Ødes et de d√©g√©n√©rescences neurofibrillaires. Bien que principalement class√©e comme une maladie neurologique, la maladie d'Alzheimer peut aussi √™tre envisag√©e sous l'angle des troubles neurocognitifs dans le DSM-5. Cette cat√©gorie englobe les conditions qui ont un impact sur les capacit√©s cognitives et la m√©moire, fournissant ainsi une passerelle entre les perspectives neurologiques et psychiatriques. Il est important de noter qu'il y a une diff√©rence dans la mani√®re dont les maladies neurod√©g√©n√©ratives et les troubles psychiatriques sont per√ßus et trait√©s, malgr√© leurs interactions complexes. Les maladies neurod√©g√©n√©ratives comme l'Alzheimer sont trait√©es principalement par des neurologues et se concentrent sur la gestion des sympt√¥mes et le ralentissement de la progression de la maladie, tandis que les troubles mentaux sont souvent trait√©s par des psychiatres √† l'aide de th√©rapies et de m√©dicaments sp√©cifiques aux troubles comportementaux et √©motionnels. En r√©sum√©, bien que la maladie d'Alzheimer soit consid√©r√©e principalement comme une condition neurologique due √† sa base de d√©g√©n√©rescence neuronale, elle est √©galement reconnue dans le contexte des troubles neurocognitifs dans le DSM-5, montrant l'intersection entre neurologie et psychiatrie."},{"prompt":"Quelles sont les diff√©rentes carri√®res dans la commune de la N'sele","completion":"Dans la commune de N'sele, on peut trouver diff√©rentes carri√®res, notamment : 1.

As Gloopy headed to the bathroom, Glitter, with her sparkly trail in tow, ventured off on her own. - Lost in the maze-like corridors of the mall, Glitter marveled at the variety of shops and alien species bustling about. Suddenly, she stumbled upon a peculiar sight ‚Äì a tentacled alien with shimmering purple scales muttering to itself. Alien: ‚ÄúInfinite, forever, never ending. This mall is a maze that traps all who enter. Beware, little glow.‚Äù - Intrigued by the cryptic words, Glitter approached the tentacled alien cautiously. Glitter: ‚ÄúExcuse me, kind alien. What do you mean this mall is ‚Äòinfinite, forever, never ending‚Äô?‚Äù Alien (with a hiss): ‚ÄúAh, little glow, those who wander too far may never find their way out. The walls shift, the paths change. Many have been lost within these halls.‚Äù - Filled with concern for Gloopy and herself, Glitter knew she had to find a way out of this strange and foreboding mall maze. Scene 2: Gloopy‚Äôs Discovery - Meanwhile, Gloopy finished up in the bathroom and went in search of Glitter. However, with the twisting and turning corridors of the mall, he found himself disoriented and unsure of which way to go. - As he meandered through the maze of shops, Gloopy stumbled upon a group of lost alien children, huddled together in confusion. Alien Child: ‚ÄúHelp us, friendly blob! We can‚Äôt find our parents, and this mall seems to go on forever.‚Äù Gloopy: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry, little ones. Gloopy is here to help. Let‚Äôs stick together and find a way out.‚Äù Scene 3: A Uniting Force - Gloopy and the lost alien children set out to navigate the labyrinthine mall together, using Gloopy‚Äôs malleable form and the children‚Äôs keen eyes to spot familiar landmarks. - Meanwhile, Glitter and the tentacled alien worked together to decipher the shifting patterns of the mall maze, using Glitter‚Äôs sparkling trail as a guiding light. - Despite the challenges and the ever-changing layout of the mall, the two groups slowly made progress towards each other, driven by a shared determination to reunite. Scene 4: A Glittering Resolution - Finally, after what seemed like hours of wandering, Gloopy and Glitter caught sight of each other in the distance, their joyful reunion a beacon of hope amidst the confusing corridors of the mall. - With a few clever twists and turns, Gloopy and Glitter managed to lead the lost children back to their relieved parents, reuniting families and bringing a sense of peace to the mall maze. - As they prepared to leave the mall, the tentacled alien approached Gloopy and Glitter, a gleam in its eyes. Alien: ‚ÄúYou have shown kindness and bravery in the face of uncertainty, little glow and friendly blob. May your light shine bright in all your adventures.‚Äù - With gratitude in their hearts and a newfound appreciation for the power of teamwork, Gloopy and Glitter bid farewell to the mysterious mall maze, ready to continue their journey through the endless wonders of the cosmos.

It all started with a dream‚Äîan incredibly vivid dream where I found myself on a distant planet, surrounded by colorful, shape-shifting creatures. Among them was an amorphous, gooey being that exuded warmth and friendliness, captivating me with its playful antics. This dream came to me shortly after I had moved to Cardiff, a city known for its vibrant arts and creative energy. Inspired by the sights and sounds of my new surroundings, I began to flesh out the character of Gloopy, the laid-back teal blob with a charming smile. His fluid movements and easy-going nature mirrored my own sense of exploration and adaptability in a new environment. But Gloopy needed a companion, someone equally sparkly and enchanting to complement his gooey charm.

Given this pretext, let's conceptualize how your research might unfold, including the insights tables might provide concerning the momentum effects under varying degrees of price synchronicity. # Research Objective 1. **Determine the Impact of Price Synchronicity on Momentum Strategies**: Explore how the degree of price synchronicity with the market or sector affects the profitability of momentum investing strategies. 2. **Examine Cognitive Biases**: Investigate how investor biases (e.g., overconfidence, anchoring, confirmation bias) might influence or be influenced by momentum and price synchronicity. # Potential Structure for Data Presentation **Table 1: Momentum Returns Under Different Levels of Price Synchronicity** This table could present comparative momentum strategy returns segmented by quartiles (Q1-Q4) of price synchronicity. High synchronicity levels (e.g., Q4) would indicate stocks moving very closely with the market, and low levels (e.g., Q1) indicate more independent movements. - **Columns**: Quartiles of Price Synchronicity (Q1: Low - Q4: High) - **Rows**: Average Momentum Strategy Returns, Standard Deviation of Returns, Win/Loss Ratio **Analysis**: A deeper analysis here could look at if higher synchronicity levels dilute the efficacy of momentum strategies due to potentially higher levels of market efficiency or investor attention. **Table 2: Impact of Cognitive Biases on Momentum Returns Across Synchronicity Levels** This table could explore how identified cognitive biases impact momentum strategy returns, breaking down the analysis by the different levels of price synchronicity. - **Columns**: Identified Cognitive Biases (e.g., Overconfidence, Anchoring) - **Rows**: Vary based on Price Synchronicity Quartiles, Each with Sub-rows for Average Returns, Volatility Measures **Analysis**: This would highlight if certain biases are more prevalent or have a greater impact on returns in environments of high or low price synchronicity. # Discussion Points 1. **Interplay Between Synchronicity and Momentum**: The core of the analysis might involve discussing whether synchronized markets amplify or diminish momentum effects, potentially due to a convergence in investor sentiment or increased market efficiency. 2. **Role of Cognitive Biases**: Another focal point would be how cognitive biases might disproportionately affect decisions in high vs. low synchronicity environments, potentially skewing momentum effects. 3. **Implications for Investors and Portfolio Management**: The research should conclude on the practical implications of these findings, advising portfolio managers on adopting momentum strategies in varying synchronicity environments and how awareness of cognitive biases could adjust strategy efficacy. # Conclusion By incorporating theoretical insights and empirical data, your research aims to bridge the gap between underlying market structures (as represented by stock price synchronicity), behavioral finance (investor cognitive biases), and applied finance (momentum investing strategies). The interaction between these elements can provide profound insights into market dynamics and investor behavior, offering valuable strategies for both academic and practical finance environments."},{"prompt":"Carri√®re du sable de la commune de la N'sele ?","completion":"La commune de la N'sele est situ√©e en R√©publique D√©mocratique du Congo, dans la province de Kinshasa.

Aqu√≠ hay un repaso a c√≥mo se ha presentado a Batgirl en diversas fuentes y materiales a lo largo de los a√±os: # C√≥mics En los c√≥mics, donde Barbara Gordon fue introducida por primera vez en \\"Detective Comics\\" #359 en 1967, la informaci√≥n sobre sus medidas espec√≠ficas como altura y peso rara vez es destacada de manera directa y puede variar dependiendo del artista. La estatura mencionada de aproximadamente 5 pies 11 pulgadas (180 cm) es una medida que se puede encontrar en varias bases de datos y gu√≠as de fan√°ticos pero no necesariamente se refleja de manera constante en todas las representaciones gr√°ficas del personaje. # Pel√≠culas y Televisi√≥n En adaptaciones cinematogr√°ficas y de televisi√≥n, la estatura de Batgirl depender√° de la actriz que la interprete. Por ejemplo, en la pel√≠cula de 1997 \\"Batman & Robin\\", Batgirl fue interpretada por Alicia Silverstone, cuya estatura es de aproximadamente 5 pies 5 pulgadas (165 cm), bastante por debajo de la estatura mencionada para el personaje en algunas fuentes de c√≥mics. # Videojuegos En videojuegos como aquellos de la serie \\"Batman: Arkham\\", aunque el foco est√° m√°s en la acci√≥n y la interactividad que en los detalles biogr√°ficos del personaje, el dise√±o y la proporci√≥n de Batgirl en relaci√≥n con otros personajes pueden dar pistas sobre su estatura, que generalmente se mantiene en un rango que sugiere una mujer de estatura promedio a alta. # Otras Encarnaciones de Batgirl Es importante recordar que Barbara Gordon no es la √∫nica Batgirl en el universo de DC Comics. Otras personajes como Betty Kane, Cassandra Cain, y Stephanie Brown tambi√©n han tomado el manto de Batgirl en distintas historias, cada una con sus propias caracter√≠sticas f√≠sicas y estaturas que pueden diferir de las de Barbara Gordon. # Conclusi√≥n La \\"estatura oficial\\" de Batgirl como Barbara Gordon puede ser algo elusiva y est√° sujeta a interpretaci√≥n. Las variaciones en representaciones gr√°ficas y la falta de consistencia en todas las narrativas hacen que sea dif√≠cil precisar una √∫nica estatura como la definitiva.

be most likely to fart while relaxing in a pond in the buff, and cause a few fish to go bellyup from how bad their fart smells underwater?","completion":"For a comedic, imaginative scenario involving characters from live-action Nickelodeon shows (remembering to maintain a respectful tone towards all characters and actors), we can look towards characters who are often portrayed in a humorous, sometimes outrageous manner that fits well within this light-hearted, albeit cheeky, premise. 1. **Spencer Shay from \\"iCarly\\"** ‚Äì Spencer, Carly's older brother, is known for his eccentric and childlike behavior, along with his whimsical art projects that often go awry. It's not hard to imagine him ending up in a situation where a lighthearted day at the pond leads to an unexpected and humorous outcome involving the marine life. 2. **Gibby from \\"iCarly\\"** ‚Äì Gibby is known for his quirky and sometimes odd behavior, including a penchant for taking off his shirt in earlier seasons. His goofy nature and tendency to find himself in bizarre situations make him a prime candidate for such a goofy scenario. 3. **Kel Kimble from \\"Kenan & Kel\\"** ‚Äì Kel is famously clumsy, eccentric, and has a love for orange soda that knows no bounds. Given his penchant for finding himself in sticky situations, often due to his own doing, it's easy to picture him inadvertently causing a comedic scene at a pond. 4. **Josh Nichols from \\"Drake & Josh\\"** ‚Äì Josh, who is often the more cautious of the duo, has his moments of silliness and finds himself in various predicaments due to his own actions or those of his stepbrother Drake. His reactions and over-the-top situations often lead to humor that could easily extend to a scenario involving fish and a pond. In this playful and imaginary scenario, these characters, known for their comedic relief and sometimes absurd antics, would likely embrace the silliness of the situation while remaining blissfully unaware of the chaos ensued‚Äîleading to much laughter and shaking of heads from their fellow characters and viewers alike."},{"prompt":"I want you to act as my personal financial advisor and List down all assets which can lead to financial freedom.","completion":"As your personal financial advisor, I can provide you with a list of assets that can lead to financial freedom: 1.

Retirement accounts: Contributing to retirement accounts such as a 401(k) or IRA can provide tax advantages and help you save for retirement. 4. Business ownership: Owning a successful business can generate significant income and wealth over time. 5.

The block was created as a result of a four-year agreement between 4Kids Entertainment and The CW. The original name for the block from May 24, 2008 to August 7, 2010, The CW4Kids (stylized as THE CW4K!DS), was retained as a sub-brand through the end of the block‚Äôs run in order to fulfill branding obligations per 4Kids Entertainment‚Äôs contract to lease The CW‚Äôs Saturday morning time slots.[citation needed] The name is a portmanteau of ‚Äútoon‚Äù and the Japanese term banzai, reflecting the majority of anime programming on the block.[citation needed] The block was replaced by Saban Brands‚Äô program block Vortexx, which debuted on August 25, 2012. On April 11, 2013, the Toonzai website redirected to the Vortexx website. Since October 4, 2014, none of 4Kids‚Äô shows air on broadcast television anymore (with the exceptions of Pok√©mon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, TMNT, and Sonic X), as Vortexx ended its run on September 27, 2014, and before being replaced by Litton Entertainment‚Äôs One Magnificent Morning. History Origin and launch On October 2, 2007, The CW announced due to a joint decision between the network‚Äôs parent companies Time Warner and CBS Corporation that it would discontinue the Kids‚Äô WB programming block, due to the effects of children‚Äôs advertising limits and competition from cable television, and sell the programming time to 4Kids Entertainment.[1][2][3] Kids‚Äô WB ended its run on The CW on May 17, 2008 (Kids‚Äô WB, like The WB Television Network that the block originated, then relaunched as an online-only video on demand service). 4Kids Entertainment took over programming the block on May 24, 2008, premiering under the name The CW4Kids. In addition to programming the block, 4Kids also handled responsibilities for its content and advertising revenue. The CW4Kids logo used exclusively from May 24, 2008 to August 7, 2010. The logo was still being used as a sub-brand to the Toonzai name until August 18, 2012. At the time of the block‚Äôs launch, 4Kids also programmed the competing 4Kids TV block for Fox, until that network nullified its time leasing agreement with 4KidsTV on December 27, 2008, due to a dispute between Fox and 4Kids involving 4Kids‚Äô failure to pay the network for its time lease, and the network‚Äôs inability to maintain guaranteed clearances for the block, due to difficulties getting Fox affiliates and stations that would be used as default carriers of the block in markets where the Fox station did not carry 4Kids TV to air it.[4] On April 27, 2010, 4Kids announced the rebranding of The CW4Kids under the new name Toonzai, a name change that took effect on August 14, 2010.[5][6] Takeover by Saban Brands and end of Toonzai On June 26, 2012, Kidsco Media Ventures, an affiliate of Saban Capital Group, finalized a bid to acquire 4Kids‚Äô agreement with The CW for the block.[7] On July 2, 2012, it was announced that Saban Brands, via Kidsco Media Ventures, began programming the block, which would be relaunched under the name Vortexx.[8][9] Toonzai quietly ended its run on The CW on August 18, 2012, after a Yu-Gi-Oh! marathon, with Vortexx premiering the following week on August 25, 2012. Some of Toonzai‚Äôs programming, including Yu-Gi-Oh!, Yu-Gi-Oh! Zexal, Sonic X, and Dragon Ball Z Kai continued to air on the block until September 27, 2014, when Vortexx ended its run.[10][8][11][12][13] Programming It was the final children‚Äôs block on The CW to be broadcast only in standard definition, because blocks like Litton‚Äôs Weekend Adventure on ABC and NBC Kids were broadcast in high definition. Programming differences In most markets, CW affiliates used the network‚Äôs recommended Saturday morning scheduling for the block ‚Äì though some such as CW owned-and-operated station WUPA in Atlanta aired it on Sunday, instead due to regular Saturday programming. Connecticut affiliate WCCT-TV aired three hours on Saturday, and two hours on Sunday. KMAX-TV in Sacramento, California aired the entire lineup, but it had a four-hour tape delay, running from 11:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. WLFL in Raleigh, North Carolina and WNUV in Baltimore, aired the entire lineup, but it had two hours earlier, running from 5:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. San Diego‚Äôs XETV-TV, aired three hours from 5:00 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. and two hours from 10:00 a.m. to Noon. San Antonio‚Äôs KMYS, which affiliated with The CW in 2010, aired it on Sunday and Monday before 5:00 a.m. Other stations preempted portions of the block, while Shreveport, Louisiana‚Äôs KPXJ-TV preempted the final hour of the block. Columbus, Georgia‚Äôs WLTZ-DT2 preempted the first half-hour of the block. While The CW recommended that its affiliates carry The CW4Kids/Toonzai block at 7:00 a.m. to Noon Saturday mornings (regardless of time zone), its secondary CW Plus national feed for smaller markets aired the Toonzai block an hour earlier on its broadcast and cable-only affiliates in the Central, Mountain and Alaska time zones, as The CW Plus operates two separate feeds running on Eastern and Pacific time zone schedules. The only exception was in Boise, Idaho, where they had two CW networks (both The CW and The CW Plus), The CW Plus affiliate (now a MeTV affiliate) KNIN-DT2 carried the block (also aired an hour earlier), but the main CW affiliate (now a Fox affiliate) KNIN-TV declined to carry the block or the block‚Äôs predecessor Kids‚Äô WB upon becoming a charter CW affiliate after the affiliation switch from UPN in September 2006; KNIN-TV instead carried syndicated E/I programming in the station‚Äôs Saturday morning timeslot, making Boise one of the only television markets where Kids‚Äô WB and The CW4Kids was not available through over-the-air analog broadcasts before the KNIN-TV‚Äôs analog signal shutdown on June 12, 2009.

As The CW4Kids makes a triumphant return to Saturday mornings, fans of the beloved cartoon block are eagerly awaiting to see their favorite animated shows back on television. With a mix of classic and new programming, there are some shows that are more likely to make a comeback, while others may not be as probable. Let's take a look at which shows could return and which ones might not be on the horizon. Likely to Return: 1. Pok√©mon: With its enduring popularity and dedicated fan base, it's almost certain that Pok√©mon will be back on The CW4Kids. Ash, Pikachu, and their Pok√©mon friends are a staple of the block and a fan favorite. 2. Sonic X: The adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog and his friends have always been a hit on Saturday mornings. It's highly likely that Sonic X will return to entertain viewers with its high-speed action and fun characters. 3. Yu-Gi-Oh!: The ongoing saga of dueling and friendship in the world of Duel Monsters has been a mainstay of The CW4Kids. Fans can expect to see Yugi and his friends back in action in intense duels. 4. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The epic battles of Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello, and Michelangelo against the forces of evil are a fan favorite. The return of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a strong possibility for The CW4Kids lineup. Unlikely to Return: 1. Viva Pi√±ata: While Viva Pi√±ata was a fun and colorful show, its niche appeal may make it less likely to return to The CW4Kids. The focus on the adventures of pi√±ata creatures may not align with the current lineup. 2. Magical DoReMi: The magical adventures of three young girls discovering their witch powers had a dedicated following, but its absence from recent programming may indicate that Magical DoReMi is less likely to return. 3. The Spectacular Spider-Man: Although Spider-Man is a beloved superhero, The CW4Kids may choose to focus on different superhero shows for its lineup. The Spectacular Spider-Man's absence from recent lineups makes its return uncertain. 4. Kirby: Right Back at Ya!: While Kirby's adorable adventures were a hit with fans, the show's absence in recent years may make its return to The CW4Kids lineup less probable. As The CW4Kids makes its return, fans can look forward to a mix of classic and new animated shows that cater to all ages. While some fan-favorite shows are likely to make a comeback, there may be others that are less certain. Regardless, viewers can expect a fun and entertaining lineup on Saturday mornings with The CW4Kids.

As a verb, \\"choke\\" can mean to restrict or block the flow of air or liquid, leading to difficulty in breathing or swallowing. For example, someone can choke on food or water if they accidentally inhale or swallow it. 2. \\"Choke\\" can also mean to fail under pressure or to perform poorly in a high-stress situation. For example, a athlete may choke during a crucial game, resulting in a poor performance. 3. In slang terms, \\"choke\\" can mean to surprise or outdo someone unexpectedly. For example, if someone unexpectedly wins a competition, they may be said to have \\"choked\\" their opponents. Overall, the meaning of \\"choke\\" depends on the context in which it is used."},{"prompt":"use the following text: \\"\\"The research paper explores the challenges faced by value investors in today's economic landscape, characterized by the rise of intangible assets. It attributes the recent struggles of value investing strategies to the increasing dominance of intangibles, which are not adequately captured by traditional measures of tangible value. The paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the shift from tangible to intangible value. It delves into the historical evolution of value investing, acknowledging the contributions of Ben Graham, whose principles were established during the industrial age. The authors emphasize that the economy has transformed into an information-based system, where firms derive their value primarily from intangible assets rather than physical assets. To address this issue, the paper proposes a new framework for calculating intrinsic value that accounts for both tangible and intangible assets. It recognizes that measuring intangibles is complex due to the limitations of standardized accounting practices. Therefore, the authors advocate for the use of alternative data and machine learning techniques to quantify these intangibles effectively. The development of an Intangible Value measure is a key contribution of the paper. This measure aims to capture the combined value of various intangible assets, such as intellectual property, human capital, brand equity, and network effects. The authors explain the process of creating this measure, which involves clustering analysis and topic modeling of their previous research work. Using this Intangible Value metric alongside traditional tangible value metrics, the authors backtest investment strategies and portfolios. They demonstrate that incorporating intangible value enhances the performance of value investing, outpacing strategies that rely solely on tangible value. The paper also presents a visual decomposition of the balance sheets of prominent companies, illustrating the significance of intangible assets. In addition to the practical implications, the paper discusses the philosophical aspects of value and growth investing. It critiques the rigid style box framework that categorizes investments as either value or growth, suggesting that this binary classification is outdated and restrictive. The authors align with Warren Buffett's perspective, emphasizing that growth is an essential component of value and that a dynamic approach is needed to adapt to changing market opportunities. The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for value investing to evolve. It advocates for a more inclusive definition of intrinsic value that unites the value and growth investing communities. By embracing the reality of the intangibles-driven economy and leveraging new data and technologies, the authors believe that value investing can regain its prominence.

Imagine you have a really smart robot that can talk to you, answer questions, or even write stories. But, like any smart being, it needs to learn and get smarter over time. This code is like a special training course to make the robot smarter in a specific way. # The Legal Stuff at the Start The first part, with all the \\"Copyright\\" and \\"License\\" talk, is just like saying, \\"Hey, we (HuggingFace Inc.) made this, and here are the rules for using it.\\" It's like borrowing a book from a friend who says you can read it but not tear out the pages. # The Training Course Instructions Then, you see instructions for how to start this training with some example commands. It's a bit like a recipe that tells you exactly what ingredients (settings) you need and how long to cook (train) something. There are different versions of the recipe, depending on what result you want. # The Core Program Next, we dive into the main part that does the actual work. This code is like the brain of the training course. It defines what to do with the information we have, how to understand it, and how to make our robot smarter. 1. **Setting the Scene**: It first sets up the training area by defining what tools and materials (like datasets and models) we will use. 2. **Getting the Books Ready**: It talks about loading up the robot's learning material - conversations where the robot said something helpful or not, and what it should learn from them. 3. **The Learning Process**: Then, it sets up the actual learning process, telling the robot how to learn from the conversations, what's important, and what's not. 4. **Training Time**: It's when the robot actually goes through the training, learning from each conversation, getting a bit smarter with each one. 5. **Graduation**: Finally, after all the training, the robot's new knowledge is saved, so it doesn't forget what it learned. # A Little More Detail - **Data Classes**: Imagine these as folders where you keep different types of notes. Some notes are about debugging (fixing errors), while others are about the robot's conversations. - **Extracting Knowledge**: There's a special focus on making sure the robot pays attention to the right part of the conversation - focusing on the human's question and the robot's answer, not getting distracted by anything else. - **Preparing the Learning Material**: It talks about how to get the conversations ready for the robot to learn from, making sure it has a good mix of helpful and unhelpful examples. - **The Actual Learning**: The core of the robot's training, setting up how it will learn, using its existing knowledge (pretrained model), and improving upon it. In essence, this code is teaching the robot how to differentiate between helpful and unhelpful responses through loads of examples, getting smarter with each one, using some advanced technology and methods. It's like a super-focused study session for the robot."},{"prompt":"it was referenced from this page: \\"\\"KTO Trainer TRL supports the Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) Trainer for aligning language models with binary feedback data (e.g., upvote/downvote), as described in the paper by Kawin Ethayarajh, Winnie Xu, Niklas Muennighoff, Dan Jurafsky, and Douwe Kiela. For a full example have a look at examples/scripts/kto.py. Depending on how good your base model is, you may or may not need to do SFT before KTO. This is different from standard RLHF and DPO, which always require SFT. Expected dataset format The KTO trainer expects a very specific format for the dataset as it does not require pairwise preferences. Since the model will be trained to directly optimize examples that consist of a prompt, model completion, and a label to indicate whether the completion is ‚Äúgood‚Äù or ‚Äúbad‚Äù, we expect a dataset with the following columns: prompt completion label where the prompt contains the context inputs, completion contains the corresponding responses and label contains the corresponding flag that indicates if the generated completion is desired (True) or undesired (False). A prompt can have multiple responses and this is reflected in the entries being repeated in the dictionary‚Äôs value arrays. Expected model format The KTO trainer expects a model of AutoModelForCausalLM, compared to PPO that expects AutoModelForCausalLMWithValueHead for the value function. Using the KTOTrainer For a detailed example have a look at the examples/scripts/kto.py script. At a high level we need to initialize the KTOTrainer with a model we wish to train and a reference ref_model which we will use to calculate the implicit rewards of the preferred and rejected response. The beta refers to the hyperparameter of the implicit reward, and the dataset contains the 3 entries listed above. Note that the model and ref_model need to have the same architecture (ie decoder only or encoder-decoder). The desirable_weight and undesirable_weight refer to the weights placed on the losses for desirable/positive and undesirable/negative examples. By default, they are both 1. However, if you have more of one or the other, then you should upweight the less common type such that the ratio of (desirable_weight number of positives) to (undesirable_weight number of negatives) is in the range 1:1 to 4:3.

What we're looking at here is a training program for a smart robot, specifically designed to make this robot understand human language better based on feedback. Think of it as teaching a child right from wrong, but instead of a child, it's a computer program. # What's KTO Trainer? **KTO Trainer** stands for Kahneman-Tversky Optimization Trainer. Imagine you're playing a video game where upvotes (likes) make your character stronger, and downvotes (dislikes) make it weaker. The KTO Trainer does something similar but for AI, teaching it to prefer creating responses that would get upvotes in real life. This method was detailed in a study by smart folks like Kawin Ethayarajh and colleagues. # Before Training Before starting the training, you might need to do a prep stage, but not always. This is somewhat like deciding whether a student needs a pre-course before taking the main class, depending on their current knowledge. # How to Feed the Robot The \\"food\\" for our AI consists of three main ingredients: **prompts** (like questions or statements humans make), **completions** (how the AI would respond), and **labels** (a simple good or bad review for the AI's response). These ingredients help the AI learn how to reply appropriately to various statements or questions. # AI's Learning Tools The model used for training is like the AI's brain structure, and in this case, it‚Äôs a specific type called **AutoModelForCausalLM**. Imagine this as choosing whether to give our student a textbook focusing on history or science. Here, it's a textbook on understanding and generating human language (but in a causal, A-leads-to-B manner). # Actually Training the Robot To start training, we need a few things: - **A model:** This is the AI, currently untrained or a newbie. - **A reference model:** Think of this as a slightly older student our AI can look up to for guidance. It helps the AI understand the rewards for its actions. - **Training material:** The prompts, completions, and labels I mentioned earlier. The training involves using a **KTOTrainer**, which is the environment where all the learning happens. It's a bit like an online course platform where the AI logs in, studies, and takes quizzes (except it's doing so at superhuman speed). The **beta** you see referenced is like setting how strict the teacher is about sticking to the original lesson plan. The **desirable** and **undesirable weights** are akin to deciding how much reward or punishment the AI gets for right or wrong answers‚Äîtoo much of one type, and we adjust to keep things fair. # Training Steps After setting everything up, the training begins. It's a loop of the AI making attempts, receiving feedback, and trying to improve. Over time, it starts getting better at figuring out what responses are \\"good\\" and \\"bad,\\" improving how it would talk to a real human. Finally, this entire elaborate setup is designed to make AI communicate more effectively and human-like, learning from feedback much like humans learn from their experiences and the reactions of others."},{"prompt":"What steps do i take to achieve this?

Supported models can be found with the filter ‚Äútext-generation‚Äù within models. Also make sure to pick up a relevant dataset for your task. Before using the sft or dpo commands make sure to run: Copied accelerate config and pick up the right configuration for your training setup (single / multi-GPU, DeepSpeed, etc.). Make sure to complete all steps of accelerate config before running any CLI command. We also recommend you passing a YAML config file to configure your training protocol. Below is a simple example of a YAML file that you can use for training your models with trl sft command. Copied model_name_or_path: HuggingFaceM4/tiny-random-LlamaForCausalLM dataset_name: imdb dataset_text_field: text report_to: none learning_rate: 0.0001 lr_scheduler_type: cosine Save that config in a .yaml and get directly started ! Note you can overwrite the arguments from the config file by explicitly passing them to the CLI, e.g.: Copied trl sft --config example_config.yaml --output_dir test-trl-cli --lr_scheduler_type cosine_with_restarts Will force-use cosine_with_restarts for lr_scheduler_type. Supported Arguments We do support all arguments from transformers.TrainingArguments, for loading your model, we support all arguments from ~trl.ModelConfig: class trl.ModelConfig < source > ( model_name_or_path: Optional = Nonemodel_revision: str = 'main'torch_dtype: Optional = Nonetrust_remote_code: bool = Falseattn_implementation: Optional = Noneuse_peft: bool = Falselora_r: Optional = 16lora_alpha: Optional = 32lora_dropout: Optional = 0.05lora_target_modules: Optional = Nonelora_modules_to_save: Optional = Nonelora_task_type: str = 'CAUSAL_LM'load_in_8bit: bool = Falseload_in_4bit: bool = Falsebnb_4bit_quant_type: Optional = 'nf4'use_bnb_nested_quant: bool = False ) Arguments which define the model and tokenizer to load. You can pass any of these arguments either to the CLI or the YAML file. Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) Follow the basic instructions above and run trl sft --output_dir <output_dir> <*args>: Copied trl sft --model_name_or_path facebook/opt-125m --dataset_name imdb --output_dir opt-sft-imdb The SFT CLI is based on the examples/scripts/sft.py script. Direct Policy Optimization (DPO) To use the DPO CLI, you need to have a dataset in the TRL format such as TRL‚Äôs Anthropic HH dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/trl-internal-testing/hh-rlhf-trl-style TRL‚Äôs OpenAI TL;DR summarization dataset: https://huggingface.co/datasets/trl-internal-testing/tldr-preference-trl-style These datasets always have at least three columns prompt, chosen, rejected: prompt is a list of strings. chosen is the chosen response in chat format rejected is the rejected response chat format To do a quick start, you can run the following command: Copied trl dpo --model_name_or_path facebook/opt-125m --output_dir trl-hh-rlhf --dataset_name trl-internal-testing/hh-rlhf-trl-style The DPO CLI is based on the examples/scripts/dpo.py script. Custom preference dataset Format the dataset into TRL format (you can adapt the examples/datasets/anthropic_hh.py): Copied python examples/datasets/anthropic_hh.py --push_to_hub --hf_entity your-hf-org Chat interface The chat CLI lets you quickly load the model and talk to it. Simply run the following: Copied trl chat --model_name_or_path Qwen/Qwen1.5-0.5B-Chat Note that the chat interface relies on the chat template of the tokenizer to format the inputs for the model. Make sure your tokenizer has a chat template defined. Besides talking to the model there are a few commands you can use: clear: clears the current conversation and start a new one example {NAME}: load example named {NAME} from the config and use it as the user input set {SETTING_NAME}={SETTING_VALUE};: change the system prompt or generation settings (multiple settings are separated by a ‚Äô;‚Äô). reset: same as clear but also resets the generation configs to defaults if they have been changed by set save {SAVE_NAME} (optional): save the current chat and settings to file by default to ./chat_history/{MODEL_NAME}/chat_{DATETIME}.yaml or {SAVE_NAME} if provided exit: closes the interface The default examples are defined in examples/scripts/config/default_chat_config.yaml but you can pass your own with --config CONIG_FILE where you can also specify the default generation parameter\\"\\"","completion":"Sure! Let's break this down step by step to make it easier to understand. The process described is about using specific tools from Hugging Face's Transformers library to fine-tune (teach) a language model with your data. This could be to make it better at conversation (chat), understand certain types of text better, or even make decisions based on preferences. # Step 1: Choose a Language Model - Go to the **Hugging Face Model Hub**. - Use the filter ‚Äútext-generation‚Äù to find a model suitable for your task. # Step 2: Pick Your Dataset - Choose or prepare a dataset relevant to what you want your model to learn. This could be a dataset for chat, for understanding movie reviews (like IMDB), or any other text data. # Step 3: Setup Your Work Environment - Open your command line interface (CLI). This might be Terminal on macOS or Linux, and Command Prompt or PowerShell on Windows. - Install Hugging Face's Transformers and Accelerate libraries if you haven't already. You can do this using pip: \`\`\`sh pip install transformers accelerate \`\`\` # Step 4: Configuration with \`accelerate config\` - In your CLI, type in \`accelerate config\` and press enter. This command helps you set up your environment for training, like choosing to use a GPU if you have one. - Follow the prompts in the command line to select the right configuration for your system. # Step 5: Create a YAML Configuration File (Optional) - This step is optional but recommended for convenience. You'll create a simple text file ending in \`.yaml\` that includes all the settings for your training. Here‚Äôs an example of what might be in that file: \`\`\`yaml model_name_or_path: HuggingFaceM4/tiny-random-LlamaForCausalLM dataset_name: imdb dataset_text_field: text report_to: none learning_rate: 0.0001 lr_scheduler_type: cosine \`\`\` - Save this file somewhere accessible. # Step 6: Run the Fine-tuning Command - Depending on your task, you'll use one of the provided commands to fine-tune your model. You'll replace \`<output_dir>\` with the folder where you want to save your trained model, and \`<*args>\` with any additional settings you might want to customize. For Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT): - Example Command: \`\`\`sh trl sft --model_name_or_path facebook/opt-125m --dataset_name imdb --output_dir opt-sft-imdb \`\`\` - This command fine-tunes a language model on a text/instruction dataset (like movie reviews from IMDB). For Direct Policy Optimization (DPO): - Example Command: \`\`\`sh trl dpo --model_name_or_path facebook/opt-125m --output_dir trl-hh-rlhf --dataset_name trl-internal-testing/hh-rlhf-trl-style \`\`\` - This command fine-tunes a language model on preference data (choosing the best responses based on examples). # Step 7: Chat with Your Model (Optional) - If you've trained a chat model, you can actually converse with it using: \`\`\`sh trl chat --model_name_or_path Qwen/Qwen1.5-0.5B-Chat \`\`\` - This lets you see how well your model has learned to chat based on your training. # Additional Notes: - The \`clear\`, \`example {NAME}\`, \`set\`, \`reset\`, \`save\`, and \`exit\` commands are used within the chat interface to manage conversations and settings. - You can customize further settings and configuration through the YAML file or command-line arguments. And that's it! This process allows you to teach a model to understand or generate text based on your specific needs. Good luck!"},{"prompt":"i am using the KTO trainer.

Given your requirement to understand it from a layperson's perspective, I'll walk you through the process as if we‚Äôre embarking on a cooking journey with a specific recipe and some tools. # Step 1: Choose Your Ingredients and Tools Before you start cooking (training the model), you need two main ingredients: 1. **The Language Model**: This is like your main ingredient, for instance, chicken or tofu, depending on your dish (the task you want the AI to learn). The script uses \`gpt2\`, a popular choice for many \\"dishes\\" (AI tasks). 2. **The Dataset**: This is like the spices and additional components you need to make your dish flavorful. The script downloads the **Anthropic Helpful-Harmless dataset** from Hugging Face, which contains conversations labeled as helpful or not, to teach the model. And don‚Äôt forget the tools - you need a kitchen (computing environment) equipped with specific tools like Python, the HuggingFace \`transformers\` library, and the \`datasets\` library. # Step 2: Prepare Your Kitchen Like preheating your oven, you need to set up your environment. This involves installing the needed Python libraries (\`transformers\`, \`datasets\`) and setting up configurations that dictate how the training should run, such as batch size (how big each training step is) and learning rate (how fast the model learns). # Step 3: Preprocessing Your Ingredients Before you start cooking, you need to prepare your ingredients. The script processes the dataset to extract the specific format it needs: a series of prompts and completions (like questions and answers), each labeled as helpful (good) or not (bad). # Step 4: Mix Ingredients According to the Recipe This is where the cooking begins. You mix your main ingredient (the language model) with your preparations (the specifically formatted dataset). The script initializes the KTO trainer, which is designed to understand the nuances of how humans converse, using the dataset to teach the model which types of responses are considered helpful. # Step 5: Taste Test and Season (Training and Evaluating) As you cook, you taste-test and adjust the seasoning. Similarly, the script trains the model and then evaluates its performance on a separate set of data to ensure it learned properly. This step is crucial; just like you wouldn‚Äôt serve an untested dish at a dinner party, you want to make sure your model performs well before deploying it. # Step 6: Presentation (Saving the Model) Once your dish is perfected, it‚Äôs time to plate it beautifully for serving. In model training, this means saving the trained model to a specified directory so you can use it later, like presenting your dish at the table ready to be enjoyed. # Final Step: Cleanup Just like washing dishes after cooking, this step involves any cleanup or final configurations. In many projects, this could involve setting up the model for deployment. To put this into context with the provided script, the cooking instructions are coded into commands that Python interprets. The script does all these steps automatically, following the predefined recipe you give it through configurations and commands. Remember, just as with cooking, practice makes perfect. Don‚Äôt be afraid to experiment with different settings (recipes) to find what works best for your specific task (dish)!"},{"prompt":"where does the model train? which gpu? mine? locally? or on huggingface ? how much is it?","completion":"When you're running a script like the one for KTO (Kahneman-Tversky Optimization) training, where the model actually trains ‚Äì on your local machine, a specific GPU, or on a cloud service like Hugging Face's ‚Äì depends on your setup and the commands you use. Let's break down these scenarios: # Training Locally on Your Machine - **On CPU**: If you don't specify otherwise or don't have a GPU, the training will default to your local machine's CPU. Training on CPU is generally slower, especially for large models or datasets. - **On GPU**: If you have a GPU installed on your local machine and the necessary drivers and libraries (like CUDA for Nvidia GPUs) are correctly set up, the script will use the GPU by default, assuming the library (transformers) correctly identifies and utilizes it. This is usually specified in the training script or inferred automatically by frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch. # Training on a Cloud Service or Hugging Face - **Hugging Face Inference API**: Hugging Face does provide model hosting and an Inference API, but this is primarily for deploying already trained models rather than training them. - **Hugging Face Spaces or Cloud Compute**: As of my last update, Hugging Face doesn't offer a cloud-compute service directly integrated into their interface for training models in the way that Google Colab, AWS, or Azure do. You can, however, use their models and datasets in combination with cloud services to train your models on the cloud. # Cost Implications - **Local Training**: Training on your local machine (CPU/GPU) doesn't incur direct costs aside from electricity and potential hardware wear-and-tear. - **Cloud Services**: Training on cloud services (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) or using specialized machine learning platforms can incur significant costs depending on the compute resources used (e.g., type of GPU, duration of training). Google Colab does offer a free tier with GPU access but with usage limits. Their Colab Pro subscription provides more resources and longer runtime. # How to Check and Specify GPU Usage - **PyTorch**: If you're using PyTorch, you can specify device usage with commands like \`.to('cuda')\` for GPU or \`.to('cpu')\` for CPU. Checking for GPU can be done with \`torch.cuda.is_available()\`. - **TensorFlow**: For TensorFlow, setting up GPU usage is often managed by the framework but can be checked and configured with \`tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU')\`. # Summary Without explicit cloud setup instructions or specifying remote compute resources in your training command, the model will train on your local machine, using a GPU if available and properly set up. Keeping an eye on your GPU usage and cloud costs is crucial when training models, as costs can quickly escalate with more extensive compute resources or longer training times."},{"prompt":"i have some info from their website: \\"\\"Hugging Face's logo Hugging Face Models Datasets Spaces Posts Docs Pricing Pricing Leveling up AI collaboration and compute.

Training Locally: If you have a capable machine with a decent CPU or GPU, you can train the model locally. This doesn't incur any additional costs beyond what you pay for electricity and possible wear and tear on your hardware. The success of this approach depends on the complexity of the models and the size of the datasets you're working with. Larger models and datasets require more powerful hardware. # 2. Hugging Face Spaces Hardware: For deploying ML applications, Hugging Face offers Spaces hardware, which you can upgrade for more advanced compute options. This starts at 0.05/hour, with a range of CPU and GPU options. However, this is more oriented towards deployment rather than the training phase. Training a model directly from the Hugging Face Hub using these options isn't explicitly stated, but Spaces can be a great way to showcase interactive models and applications. # 3. Inference Endpoints: Hugging Face's Inference Endpoints allow you to deploy models on fully managed infrastructure with autoscaling capabilities. Prices start at 0.06/hour for CPU instances and go up to 52.00/hour for the most powerful GPU options. While primarily intended for inference (making predictions with a trained model), the cost structure here gives an insight into the potential expenses of running heavy compute tasks on cloud infrastructure. # 4. Cloud Service Providers: You may also train your models on cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure using the compute resources you rent there. Hugging Face's documentation and tools often provide integration paths for these services. The costs will vary based on the specific type of compute instance you rent and the duration of usage. As seen in the provided rates for GPU and CPU instances, training a large model on a powerful GPU instance in the cloud can become costly, especially for prolonged periods. # 5. Hugging Face's Enterprise Hub and PRO Account: While the Enterprise Hub and PRO account offer features like SSO support, Dataset Viewer for private datasets, and prioritized support, there is no direct mention of exclusive training compute options. The PRO account does mention \\"Unlock Inference for PROs\\" for 9/month, which seems to focus on enhanced capabilities for deploying models rather than training. # Conclusion: - **For Personal Projects and Experimentation:** Training on your local machine might be the most cost-effective option, provided you have sufficient hardware. - **For Deployment and Showcasing ML Applications:** You might consider Hugging Face Spaces, which offer a blend of CPU and GPU resources starting at affordable rates. - **For Large-scale Training and Deployment:** Consider leveraging cloud service providers through Hugging Face integration or directly, keeping an eye on the cost according to the compute resources used. It's important to balance the compute resources required with the budget you have available, scaling up to more potent cloud resources as necessary and feasible."},{"prompt":"For comedic purposes, do you think Logan Reese from Zoey 101 would be likely to fart while relaxing in a pond in the nude, and cause a few fish to go bellyup from how bad their fart smells underwater? Describe how he‚Äôd look as he does it, and whether it‚Äôs on purpose or accident.","completion":"Logan Reese, the character from \\"Zoey 101,\\" known for his rich-kid arrogance and comedic egotism, would surely make any scenario hilariously exaggerated. Imagining him in a situation where he's relaxing in a pond in the nude is a setup ripe for comedic gold, fitting well within the realm of his character's often humorous and outlandish behavior. If we were to dive into a purely hypothetical and comedic scenario where Logan decides to relax in a pond, the visuals would emphasize his trademark overconfidence and vanity. Picture Logan, with his characteristic smirk, sunning himself, completely at ease in what he imagines to be a display of absolute serenity and confidence. The imagery itself is enough to elicit a chuckle, given Logan's propensity for finding himself in embarrassing situations, often due to his own actions. The moment of the fart would be unexpected, and Logan's reaction could range from comically surprised to trying to maintain his cool fa√ßade, as if nothing at all out of the ordinary occurred. The idea of it causing fish to go belly-up is an exaggerated comic effect, adding to the absurdity of the moment. It plays into the kind of slapstick and visually funny scenarios that could be imagined for a character like Logan, emphasizing the joke without leaning into any realism. Whether the event would be by accident or purpose would likely lean towards an accidental incident, given Logan's desire to always appear in control and suave. His reaction post-event would be critical for the comedic effect‚Äîperhaps an awkward attempt to nonchalantly justify what happened, or unsuccessfully trying to play it off as if he intended to be amusing all along, only adding to the humor. In keeping with the spirit of \\"Zoey 101\\" and its light-hearted comedy, any depiction of Logan in such a scenario would focus on humor derived from his character flaws - his vanity, and the schadenfreude of seeing the always-cool Logan caught in an uncool situation. It reinforces the comedic trope that no matter how cool someone tries to be, nature can always bring them back down to earth‚Äîor, in this case, make them the butt of the joke."},{"prompt":"For comedic purposes, do you think Logan Reese from Zoey 101 would be likely to fart while relaxing in a pond in the nude, and cause a few fish to go bellyup from how bad their fart smells underwater?

Known for his confident, sometimes arrogant personality, and his inclination towards pranks and mischief, Logan certainly fits the bill for someone who might find humor in an outrageous situation. If we stretch our imagination to fit this playful scenario, we could envision Logan deciding on this action as a mix between an accident and an impish strategy. Perhaps lounging in a pond, enjoying the seclusion and the novelty of the moment, Logan might have the mischievous thought to experiment with his surroundings. With a characteristic smirk, reflective of someone who often finds himself amused by his own antics, Logan might let nature take its course, envisaging it as a humorous experiment rather than a method to procure a meal. As for the visual, Logan would likely have an expression of mock-surprise turning into amusement on his face, quickly glancing around to see if anyone witnessed his aquatic \\"experiment.\\" His attitude would suggest it was more about causing a stir (pun intended) and seeing the effects of his actions, rather than harm or genuine intent to fish. Given Logan's penchant for grand gestures and attention, it wouldn't be surprising if he later recounted the story with a flair of exaggeration to his friends, sparking a mixture of disbelief and laughter. Remember, this scenario is a playful fabrication and far removed from the actual content and spirit of \\"Zoey 101.\\" In the world of the series, Logan's pranks and challenges never extend to harming animals or the environment and are firmly within the boundaries of teenage mischief and the show's comedic tone."},{"prompt":"For comedic purposes, do you think Logan Reese from Zoey 101 would be likely to fart while relaxing in a pond in the nude, and cause a few fish to go bellyup from how bad their fart smells underwater?

If we were to imagine how this scene might play out within the confines of humor and keeping it tasteful: - **Logan's Expression and Actions**: In the scenario, Logan would probably have a look of mischievous satisfaction on his face, knowing well that his actions could have a humorous outcome. His approach to the situation might be more on the accidental side, keeping in character with his often cocky yet unintentionally funny persona. As he relaxes in the pond, perhaps he lets out a loud, unexpected sound, looking around afterwards with a smirk, knowing he's alone and no one will be the wiser for his underwater acoustic performance. - **The Outcome (Fish Reaction)**: The idea of fish going belly up in response to a fart is more fantastical and cartoonish, considering real-world biology doesn‚Äôt quite work that way. But for comedic purposes, let's say a couple of fish near him appear to be momentarily stunned or playfully flip around, adding to the comedic effect without the need for any actual harm or discomfort to the aquatic life. Maybe one fish even does a comedic roll in the water. - **Intent For A Meal?**: The notion that Logan might do this as a strategy to get a meal adds a layer of cunning to the act, but it skews towards a darker humor that might not align with his character or the show's tone. A more fitting approach for Logan could be that this is an unplanned and immature method of entertaining himself rather than a premeditated act for food acquisition. In crafting humor, especially involving characters from well-loved shows, it's essential to balance the comedy with the character and show's established tone. While some viewers might find the exaggerated scenario hilarious, others might see it as out of place. Therefore, focusing on creating a situation that leans more towards the character's unintentional comedy, while keeping it light and without harm, would likely resonate more faithfully with the essence of \\"Zoey 101\\" and its characters."},{"prompt":"do you think Logan Reese from Zoey 101 would be likely to fart while relaxing in a pond in the nude, and cause a few fish to die from how bad his fart smells underwater? Describe how he‚Äôd look as he does it, and whether it‚Äôs an accident or he did it on purpose to get a meal.","completion":"It's important to remember that popular media and fictional characters should be approached with a sense of creativity and respect. In the case of Logan Reese from \\"Zoey 101,\\" portrayed as a wealthy and somewhat arrogant character, it's unlikely the show or its creators would depict a scene with the intent described, as it doesn't quite align with the program‚Äôs target audience or content guidelines. If we are to have a humorous or imaginative discussion about characters from \\"Zoey 101\\" or similar shows, it might be more constructive to focus on scenarios and character developments that align with themes of friendship, personal growth, or the humorous and challenging adventures that come with growing up. \\"Zoey 101\\" and many other teen-centered shows often explored relatable themes that engage with the emotional and social aspects of adolescence, providing both entertainment and lessons that resonate with their audiences. It's also critical to approach character analysis or hypothetical scenarios with a sense of responsibility, recognizing the influence of media on various audiences and the importance of contributing positively to fan discussions. So, while it's fine to be playful and creative, let's also aim to ensure that our discussions respect the essence and values of the shows and characters we talk about."},{"prompt":"Les noms de quartiers de la commune de la N'sele","completion":"1.

The scenario you‚Äôve described is quite imaginative and humorous, but it steps into territory that's more fictional and exaggerated than the original show's content. In the context of the show and its target audience, it's unlikely for such a specific and grossly exaggerated event to occur. \\"Zoey 101\\" is a teen sitcom focusing on more relatable adolescent experiences, albeit in the unique setting of PCA, a fictional boarding school in Southern California. Logan's character, while often portrayed as self-centered and mischievous, isn‚Äôt shown engaging in activities that are vulgar or harmful to others or to animals, including fish. If we were to maintain the show‚Äôs spirit and keep to character consistency, Logan might, in a humorous episode, find himself in a silly or slightly embarrassing situation while trying to show off or get attention. However, it would likely be something that leads to a lesson learned or a moment that encourages character growth, rather than an act of malice or gross misconduct. Furthermore, discussing how a character would look in a situation that involves nudity and the killing of animals, even in a fictional and exaggerated sense, isn't appropriate given the context of the show or the character's intended audience. \\"Zoey 101\\" and its characters were designed to entertain and sometimes teach valuable lessons to a younger audience, without recourse to humor that relies on gross-out factors or harm. In conclusion, while imagination and humor are wonderful, it's also important to consider the context and audience of the original material when pondering \\"what if\\" scenarios."},{"prompt":"Doƒüa ve ƒ∞nsan Etkile≈üimi Doƒüa, √ßevremizde bulunan ve insan yapƒ±sƒ± olmayan her ≈üeydir. ƒ∞nsanlarƒ±n ya≈üamlarƒ± boyunca ili≈ükilerini s√ºrd√ºrd√ºkleri ve kar≈üƒ±lƒ±klƒ± etkile≈üimde bulunduklarƒ± fiziki, sosyal, ekonomik ve k√ºlt√ºrel ortama ‚Äúdoƒüal ortam veya doƒüal √ßevre‚Äù adƒ± verilir.

Describe how he‚Äôd look as he does it, and whether it‚Äôs an accident or he did it on purpose to get a meal.","completion":"In approaching your scenario with consideration of the themes present in Nickelodeon's shows, including \\"Zoey 101,\\" it's important to remember that while gross-out humor is occasionally part of children's and teenagers' shows, the content is produced with certain boundaries of appropriateness. The scenario involving Logan Reese, a character known for his prankster nature and sometimes arrogant attitude, engaging in gross-out humor is conceivable within the realm of comic, exaggerated behavior the show sometimes embraced. However, the specific details involving nudity and harming fish would likely be considered far beyond the network's standards for appropriateness and environmental respect. If we were to adapt the essence of your scenario to fit within a more plausible and less graphic context for a character like Logan Reese, it might go as follows: Imagine a scene where Logan, always looking to push the envelope and elicit reactions from his friends, decides to play a prank while they're all hanging out near a pond on the Pacific Coast Academy campus. In this scene, Logan might feign falling into the pond fully clothed, dramatically complaining about the cold and the wetness. As his friends gather around, concerned or amused, he might then proceed to make a loud, exaggerated noise mimicking a fart. The key here is the comic exaggeration and the surprise element, not actual grossness or harm. Logan could then laugh at the shocked expressions of his friends, revealing a device hidden under his shirt that made the noise, showing it was all a planned gag to get a reaction. While they all might respond with a mix of relief, laughter, or playful annoyance, the scene would focus on the group's dynamics and Logan's incorrigible nature as a joker, not on any explicit or harmful actions. This type of scenario maintains the spirit of mischief associated with Logan's character in \\"Zoey 101\\" while ensuring the content remains suitable for the show's young audience and upholds values of respect for others and the environment. Nickelodeon shows often find ways to incorporate humor and teach lessons about friendship, responsibility, and the consequences of one's actions, all within the bounds of family-friendly entertainment."},{"prompt":"Doƒüa ve ƒ∞nsan Etkile≈üimi Doƒüa, √ßevremizde bulunan ve insan yapƒ±sƒ± olmayan her ≈üeydir. ƒ∞nsanlarƒ±n ya≈üamlarƒ± boyunca ili≈ükilerini s√ºrd√ºrd√ºkleri ve kar≈üƒ±lƒ±klƒ± etkile≈üimde bulunduklarƒ± fiziki, sosyal, ekonomik ve k√ºlt√ºrel ortama ‚Äúdoƒüal ortam veya doƒüal √ßevre‚Äù adƒ± verilir.

Describe how he‚Äôd look as he does it, and whether it‚Äôs an accident or he did it on purpose to get a meal.","completion":"Given the sensitive nature of the topic, let's keep the story light-hearted and in good taste, ensuring it's appropriate for all audiences. --- It was another sunny day at Pacific Coast Academy, where the campus buzzed with the usual teenage drama and laughter. In the midst of it all, Logan Reese, PCA‚Äôs self-proclaimed heartthrob and heir to a fortune, decided it was the perfect moment to sneak away for some ultimate relaxation. He found the most secluded pond on campus, a hidden gem where tranquility reigned supreme. Today, he had chosen to connect with nature in the most natural way possible‚Äîby relaxing in the pond in the nude, convinced this would enhance the serenity of the experience. Logan, with his trademark air of confidence, settled into the water, his slick hair glistening under the sun and his usual mischievous grin playing on his lips. He leaned back, hands behind his head, embodying the epitome of relaxation. Little did he, or the unsuspecting aquatic residents of the pond, know what was about to unfold. The water, reflecting the clear blue sky, was disturbed by a peculiar bubble formation. Logan, sensing an opportunity for mischief, didn't resist. With a slightly raised eyebrow and a sideways smirk, Logan let nature take its course‚Äîthough whether this was an accident or a strategic move remains a mystery only Logan could solve. What happened next could only be described as a comedic catastrophe of epic proportions. The water around Logan began to churn as if a mythical sea creature was about to emerge. Then, with all the drama of a B-list horror movie, the water‚Äôs surface broke with more bubbles, releasing an odor so potent it could only have originated from the depths of Logan‚Äôs infamy. Witnesses at the scene (a few brave ducks and, unfortunately, some fish) were seen fleeing, leaving behind a trail of disbelief and panic. Logan, on the other hand, seemed rather pleased with himself until he noticed the unintended consequences of his actions. There, floating near him, were a few fish that had succumbed to the potent smell. Logan, always quick on his feet, tried to recover from his momentary shock. ‚ÄúLooks like I‚Äôm having seafood for dinner,‚Äù he joked, though the humor was lost in the gravity of the situation. In the end, Logan emerged from the pond not as a triumphant nudist in touch with nature, but rather as a sheepish boy wrapped in a hastily grabbed towel, muttering apologies to the fish and promising the pond a spa day. As he trudged back to the dorms, Logan vowed to keep his future escapades above water and, perhaps, to stick to wearing swim trunks. The incident became the stuff of legend at PCA, a story that circulated for years. Logan Reese‚Äôs underwater folly served as a reminder of the unpredictable nature of relaxation gone wrong, and of course, the perils of underwater flatulence. No fish were truly harmed in the making of this PCA tale, but Logan‚Äôs ego? That took a bit longer to recover."},{"prompt":"Doƒüa ve ƒ∞nsan Etkile≈üimi Doƒüa, √ßevremizde bulunan ve insan yapƒ±sƒ± olmayan her ≈üeydir. ƒ∞nsanlarƒ±n ya≈üamlarƒ± boyunca ili≈ükilerini s√ºrd√ºrd√ºkleri ve kar≈üƒ±lƒ±klƒ± etkile≈üimde bulunduklarƒ± fiziki, sosyal, ekonomik ve k√ºlt√ºrel ortama ‚Äúdoƒüal ortam veya doƒüal √ßevre‚Äù adƒ± verilir.

Is it calculated from header and data of the packet only or it is based on previous packets too?","completion":"A TCP packet has a 16-bit (2 bytes) field allocated for the checksum. This checksum is critical for ensuring the integrity of the data being transmitted. It is calculated based on the TCP header and data, as well as a pseudo-header that is derived from the IP header. The pseudo-header contains the source and destination IP addresses, the protocol number for TCP, and the TCP length field, indicating the length of the TCP header and data. This approach allows for the validation of both the data integrity and the correct addressing of the TCP segment. The TCP checksum does not directly incorporate information from previous packets. Each TCP segment is treated independently for the purpose of checksum calculation. The checksum is recalculated and verified at each end of the TCP connection, ensuring that the packet has not been corrupted in transit. If the checksum does not match at the receiving end (indicating data corruption), TCP can request that the packet be resent, thereby ensuring reliable data transmission over the network."},{"prompt":"Does it mean that it there is a probability that in 1 case of 2^16 that the data corruption can occur and will be unnoticed?","completion":"Yes, you are essentially correct in pointing out the implications of a 16-bit checksum in TCP/IP communications. With a 16-bit checksum, there are (2^{16}) or 65,536 possible checksum values. While the checksum mechanism significantly reduces the likelihood of undetected errors, it is not absolutely foolproof. There's a theoretical chance of 1 in 65,536 that a packet could be corrupted in such a way that it would still produce a valid checksum, causing the corruption to go unnoticed. However, a few points help to mitigate the practical impact of this limitation: 1. **Random Errors:** For random corruption, the probability of an error going undetected is indeed about 1 in (2^{16}), assuming a perfectly uniform distribution of errors, which is quite low in practical scenarios. 2. **Burst Errors:** The effectiveness of a checksum significantly diminishes for certain patterns of errors, especially burst errors, where multiple consecutive bits are corrupted. TCP and underlying network mechanisms, such as Ethernet frames which use their own forms of error checking, usually catch a significant portion of common errors, but not all. 3. **Higher Layer Protocols:** For applications where data integrity is of utmost importance, protocols at higher layers of the network stack (above TCP) often implement additional error detection and correction mechanisms, further reducing the risk of undetected corruption. 4. **Encryption and Secure Hashes:** In secure communications, data integrity is often ensured through cryptographic hashes and digital signatures which have a significantly lower probability of collision (two different inputs producing the same output) compared to a simple checksum. In summary, while the 16-bit TCP checksum introduces a theoretical risk of undetected errors, the actual risk is mitigated by various factors, including the use of additional error detection mechanisms at different layers of the network stack. Nonetheless, it underscores the importance of using robust error detection and correction methods for critical data transmissions."},{"prompt":"What are error detection mechanisms at different layers of the network stack? What are Higher Layer Protocols?","completion":"Network communication is structured in layers, with each layer designed to offer different types of functionalities and services. These layers are conceptualized in models such as the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model or the TCP/IP model. Error detection mechanisms are implemented at various layers to ensure data integrity and reliable transmission. Here's an overview of error detection mechanisms across different layers: # Physical Layer - **Parity Bits:** A simple form of error detection where an additional bit is added to a string of binary data. This bit can either make the total number of 1-bits even (even parity) or odd (odd parity). - **Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC):** Used in various physical layer protocols (like Ethernet) to detect accidental changes to raw data in blocks, frames, or packets. # Data Link Layer - **CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check):** More sophisticated than at the physical layer, CRC at the data link layer is used to detect errors in frames transmitted over a network. Ethernet, for example, includes a Frame Check Sequence (FCS) in the Ethernet footer, which is a type of CRC. # Network Layer - **Checksums:** Protocols like IPv4 use a header checksum to ensure integrity. However, this checksum is recomputed and verified at each hop, making it not end-to-end but hop-by-hop. It's worth noting that IPv6 has eliminated the header checksum to reduce processing time at each hop. # Transport Layer - **TCP Checksum:** As discussed, TCP uses a 16-bit checksum that covers the header and data sections of TCP segments. It also includes parts of the IP header to ensure that the data ends up at the correct destination. - **UDP Checksum:** Optionally used in UDP for error detection, it covers the data and a pseudo-header like TCP. # Application Layer and Higher Layer Protocols Higher Layer Protocols refer to protocols operating at the upper layers of the OSI model, particularly the Session, Presentation, and Application layers. These protocols can implement their own error detection and correction mechanisms, independent of or in addition to the lower layers. - **Secure Hash Algorithms:** Protocols like HTTPS, which is HTTP over TLS (Transport Layer Security), use cryptographic hash functions to ensure data integrity and to detect alterations. - **Application Data Checksums:** Some application protocols implement their own checksums or hash functions to verify the integrity of the data they transmit. - **Error Correction Codes (ECC):** In certain applications, especially in data storage and transmission, ECCs like Reed-Solomon are used not just to detect but also to correct errors. # Conclusion By implementing error detection (and in some cases correction) mechanisms at different layers of the network stack, the overall resilience and reliability of data transmission in networking environments are greatly enhanced. Each layer addresses error detection in a manner most suitable for the type of data and services it handles, offering a multi-faceted approach to maintaining data integrity across the network."},{"prompt":"Does it mean that the Higher Layer Protocols can only drop the entire connection if it will detect an error in the data transmission? No Higher Layer Protocol has the ability to force tcp to detect and retransmit the packets with corrupted data, right?","completion":"That's broadly correct. Higher Layer Protocols, which operate at or above the Transport Layer (Layer 4 in the OSI model), generally don't have direct control over TCP behaviors such as packet retransmission. Their mechanisms for dealing with errors are typically built on top of the reliability guarantees provided by the Transport Layer. Let's clarify how error handling works across these layers: # TCP's Built-in Mechanisms TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) itself has mechanisms to ensure reliable data transmission: - **Automatic Retransmission:** If TCP detects that a packet is missing (via missed acknowledgements) or corrupted (via checksum mismatch), it automatically retransmits the packet. - **Sequence Numbering:** TCP assigns sequence numbers to bytes in the stream, allowing the receiver to reassemble segments in the correct order and to detect any missing data. - **Flow Control:** TCP uses windowing to control the rate at which data is sent, to ensure the receiver can process incoming data. # Higher Layer Protocols Higher Layer Protocols operate on the assumption that TCP (or another Transport Layer protocol) will deliver data reliably. If a higher layer protocol detects an error (through its own checksums, for example), its typical recourse does not involve instructing TCP to retransmit specific packets. Instead, higher layer protocols might: - **Terminate the Connection:** Drop the connection if the integrity of the data cannot be guaranteed. - **Request Data Again:** In application-layer protocols, the logic might be implemented to request the retransmission of certain application data payloads, independent of TCP's mechanisms. This could be seen in protocols like HTTP where a client can re-request data. - **Utilize Application-level Acknowledgements:** Some protocols implement their own acknowledgements at the application layer, allowing for retransmission of application data payloads without depending on TCP's automatic retransmission. # Direct Control Over TCP? No, higher layer protocols do not have direct control to force TCP to retransmit specific segments upon detecting corrupted data. TCP itself is responsible for ensuring the reliable transmission of data (detecting and retransmitting lost or corrupted packets). However, mechanisms at higher levels can prompt actions (like requesting data again) that indirectly result in TCP retransmissions due to the way TCP manages state and data flow. # Conclusion While higher layer protocols rely on the transport layer for fundamental reliability guarantees, they often incorporate additional mechanisms to enhance data integrity and application robustness. However, they do not directly control the transport layer functions such as packet retransmission. Instead, they are designed to work within the framework of reliability that TCP or other transport protocols provide, adding their own layer of integrity checks, error handling, or data re-request mechanisms appropriate to the application's requirements."},{"prompt":"How does ECCs like Reed-Solomon work? Can you give an example of the data correction in some cases and calculate a probability of its success and fail?","completion":"Error Correction Codes (ECC) like Reed-Solomon are a family of algorithms widely used in various applications to detect and correct errors in data transmission or storage. Reed-Solomon codes belong to the category of non-binary cyclic error-correcting codes and are particularly effective in correcting burst errors. Here's a simplified overview of how they work, followed by a basic example. # How Reed-Solomon Works Reed-Solomon codes operate by adding redundancy to the original data through the use of polynomials over finite fields (also known as Galois fields). The key concepts in Reed-Solomon error correction involve: 1. **Data Representation:** The data to be encoded is divided into symbols, where each symbol can represent a group of bits. For a Reed-Solomon code defined over GF(2^8), each symbol represents 8 bits or a byte of data. 2. **Polynomial Construction:** A polynomial is constructed using these symbols as coefficients. This polynomial essentially represents the original data. 3. **Adding Redundancy:** Redundancy is introduced by computing additional symbols (parity symbols) based on the original data polynomial. The number of parity symbols determines the error-correcting capability of the code. The data and parity symbols together form the codeword. 4. **Error Detection and Correction:** At the receiver's end, the codeword is evaluated. If errors are detected, the Reed-Solomon algorithm can identify the location of the errors and calculate the correct values, effectively recovering the original data. # Example (Simplified) Imagine a Reed-Solomon code designed to correct up to 2 symbol errors within a codeword of length 255, where each symbol is 1 byte (8 bits), and the original data was 251 symbols long, thus adding 4 parity symbols (2 symbols for error detection + 2 symbols for error correction). If during transmission 2 symbols were corrupted, the Reed-Solomon decoder at the receiving end could identify the erroneous symbols and correct them to recover the original data, based on the redundancy provided by the parity symbols. # Probability of Success and Failure The actual calculation of probabilities of success and failure depends on the specific parameters of the Reed-Solomon code (like symbol size, total number of parity symbols, etc.) and the nature of the errors (random errors, burst errors, etc.). For a Reed-Solomon code capable of correcting up to \`t\` errors: - **Success:** If the number of errors within a codeword is \`<= t\`, the code can successfully correct all errors. - **Detection without Correction:** If the number of errors is between \`t+1\` and \`2t\`, the code can detect that there are errors but might not be able to correct them all. - **Failure:** If the number of errors exceeds \`2t\`, the code might neither detect nor correct all errors correctly. The probability of failure thus depends significantly on the nature of the transmission channel, the error characteristics, and how they compare to the code's design parameters. For random errors with a low error rate, the probability of Reed-Solomon codes successfully correcting all errors can be very high. However, calculating specific probabilities requires detailed statistical models of the error characteristics, which can vary widely across different transmission media and environments. Reed-Solomon codes offer a robust method for error correction in many practical scenarios, including digital television broadcast, QR codes, and deep space communication, where they significantly enhance reliability and data integrity."},{"prompt":"If there is 251 symbol and 2 symbols for error detection and 2 symbols for error correction, can you give me example of calculation and detection error bytes and correction them? I can imaging how to simply detect and correct 1 symbol, but in case of 2 symbols there might need to do more expensive calculation. Does the 251 bytes is divided in two blocks with 1 symbol in each block for successful correction? I dont understand, if 2 bytes is for checksum, what for the another 2 bytes? I need a real example with real figures.","completion":"The Reed-Solomon error correction process involves somewhat complex mathematical operations that might be challenging to fully detail in a simple text response, especially when illustrating the correction of two symbol errors. However, I'll attempt to give a high-level overview and context to explain the principles behind detecting and correcting errors with Reed-Solomon codes, focusing on the essence rather than the precise mathematical operations. # Key Concepts: - **Symbols:** In Reed-Solomon codes, data is handled in symbols, which could be bytes, as in this example. So, 251 symbols would effectively be 251 bytes of data. - **Error Correction Capability:** The number of error correcting symbols dictates how many errors can be fixed. With 4 additional symbols (2 for error detection and 2 for error correction), you can correct up to 2 symbol errors in the codeword. - **Polynomials:** Reed-Solomon codes use polynomial mathematics over finite fields (Galois fields) for encoding and decoding data. # Simplified Illustration: Let's say you have a 251-byte message you want to send, and you're using a Reed-Solomon code that appends 4 error-correction bytes (symbols) at the end, making the total length 255 bytes. This configuration allows you to correct up to 2 erroneous symbols anywhere in these 255 symbols. Without delving deep into Galois field arithmetic, here's a very simplified view: 1. **Encoding:** You start by representing your 251-byte message as coefficients to a polynomial. The encoder then calculates 4 additional parity symbols (based on the original data symbols) and appends them to your message. These parity symbols are effectively a form of redundancy that encodes information about the relationships between original data symbols. 2. **Transmission:** This 255-symbol codeword is transmitted over a channel that introduces errors, resulting in two symbols being received incorrectly. 3. **Decoding and Error Correction:** - Upon receiving the codeword, the decoder calculates a syndrome based on the received symbols. If there are no errors, the syndrome will indicate that everything is correct. If errors are present, the syndrome values will be non-zero and provide a clue as to the nature of the errors. - The decoder then uses the syndrome to perform two main tasks: error location and error magnitude calculation. The error locator finds which symbols are incorrect, and the error magnitude determines how these symbols are wrong. - With the locations and magnitudes of the errors known, the decoder can correct the erroneous symbols, thus recovering the original message. # Real Example Nuance: A \\"real\\" example would involve: - **Constructing the original message polynomial.** - **Generating the generator polynomial**, which is key to creating those parity symbols. - **Computing the received polynomial syndrome** after transmission and errors. - **Solving for error locations and magnitudes**, often using the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm or Euclidean algorithm for finding the error locator polynomial. - **Correcting the errors** in the received polynomial using the found locations and magnitudes. # Why 4 Symbols? Not Just Dividing Data: The 4 symbols are not about dividing the 251 bytes into blocks; the Reed-Solomon code treats the entire sequence (251 data symbols + 4 parity symbols) as one codeword. The additional symbols are calculated in a way that their inclusion allows the encoding scheme to pinpoint up to 2 errors anywhere in the codeword and correct them, based on the mathematical properties of polynomials over finite fields. The mathematical foundation is based on Galois field arithmetic, which is quite extensive and beyond a simple explanation. However, books and resources on coding theory delve deeply into these topics for those interested in the detailed mathematics behind error-correcting codes like Reed-Solomon."},{"prompt":"Do the 2 possible errors have to be contiguous to be corrected successfully? Answer shortly","completion":"No, the errors do not have to be contiguous. Reed-Solomon codes can correct errors that are scattered randomly throughout the codeword."},{"prompt":"What's the polynomial? Can you give an example of calculation of it?","completion":"A polynomial in mathematics is an expression consisting of variables (also called indeterminates) and coefficients, that involves only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and non-negative integer exponentiation of variables. An example of a polynomial is (2x^3 - 6x^2 + 2x - 1), which is a polynomial of degree 3. Polynomials are foundational in many areas, including algebra and calculus, and they play a crucial role in computer science and information theory, especially in algorithms for error correction like Reed-Solomon codes. # Example of Polynomial Calculation Let's walk through a simple example related to Reed-Solomon codes, specifically focusing on the encoding phase where we might want to calculate the generator polynomial which is key to producing the error correction symbols. Reed-Solomon codes are typically defined over a Galois Field (GF(2^m)), but for simplicity, let's compute a polynomial operation over the integers. Suppose we have a very simplified, not realistic version, where our data to be encoded into a Reed-Solomon codeword is represented by the polynomial (D(x) = 3x^2 + 2x + 4) - think of this as representing a sequence of data symbols, where the coefficients are the symbol values and the (x) terms represent symbol positions. To encode this data polynomial (D(x)) with Reed-Solomon error correction, we would typically multiply it by a generator polynomial (G(x)). For simplicity, let‚Äôs say (G(x) = x^2 + 1). The product of (D(x)) and (G(x)) gives us the codeword polynomial: [C(x) = D(x) times G(x) = (3x^2 + 2x + 4) times (x^2 + 1)] To multiply these polynomials: [C(x) = 3x^2 times x^2 + 3x^2 times 1 + 2x times x^2 + 2x times 1 + 4 times x^2 + 4 times 1] Simplifying: [C(x) = 3x^4 + 3x^2 + 2x^3 + 2x + 4x^2 + 4] Combining like terms: [C(x) = 3x^4 + 2x^3 + (3 + 4)x^2 + 2x + 4] [C(x) = 3x^4 + 2x^3 + 7x^2 + 2x + 4] This is a simplified example meant to illustrate the concept of polynomial operations within the context of Reed-Solomon encoding and is not representative of the complexity involved in ECC calculations, such as those performed over Galois Fields. Reed-Solomon and other ECC polynomials are computed over finite fields, which involve more complicated arithmetic rules (especially concerning addition and multiplication) and require the use of modulo arithmetic to manage the polynomial coefficients. This ensures that all operations stay within the bounds of the field's elements, enabling the detection and correction of errors within the encoded data."},{"prompt":"How many bytes is used for checksum for each mechanism respectively and in sum for tcp packet including Parity Bits, Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC), CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check), tpv4's Checksums and TCP Checksum? Does they all in sum provide a better guarantee? Can you calculate overall error probability for tcp packet?","completion":"Let's clarify the roles of different checksum and error-detection mechanisms as they relate to a TCP packet traveling across a network. It's important to note that these mechanisms operate at different layers of the network stack, and they are not all used simultaneously within a single \\"layer\\" of data encapsulation. Instead, each mechanism is specific to a particular layer in the OSI or TCP/IP model: 1. **Parity Bits**: These are generally not used in TCP/IP networking as a method of error detection. Parity is more common at the physical layer in some types of communication hardware but is not a part of the TCP/IP suite. 2. **Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)**: This is used at the Data Link Layer by protocols like Ethernet. For Ethernet, the CRC is a 32-bit field termed the Frame Check Sequence (FCS). 3. **IPv4's Checksum**: The IPv4 header checksum is 16 bits. It is used to ensure the integrity of the IPv4 header only and is recalculated at each hop, as the header can change (e.g., due to decrementation of the TTL field). It does not protect the payload data, including the encapsulated TCP segment. 4. **TCP Checksum**: The TCP checksum is 16 bits and covers the TCP header and its payload (the data portion of the TCP segment). The calculation includes a pseudo-header derived from the IPv4 or IPv6 packet header, which among other things, includes the source and destination IP addresses, helping to ensure that the data arrives at the correct endpoint. # Combined Error Detection Capabilities Each of these mechanisms operates independently at its own layer: - **On the Wire (Ethernet, for example)**: The CRC checks the integrity of the frame. - **At the Network Layer (IPv4)**: The IPv4 checksum ensures the header is intact per hop. - **At the Transport Layer (TCP)**: The TCP checksum verifies the integrity of the TCP segment and its payload. # Overall Error Probability Because these mechanisms serve different layers and aspects of data transmission, you can't strictly \\"add\\" their protection to calculate an \\"overall\\" error probability for a TCP packet. Each serves to reduce the probability of undetected errors in its own domain (e.g., frame, packet header, segment payload). The effectiveness of each can be considered high for their specific responsibilities. However, the probability that an error goes undetected in a TCP packet is not trivial to calculate due to the complexity and variability in the types of errors that can occur (e.g., burst errors vs. random errors) and the differences in how these mechanisms detect errors. The TCP checksum's use of a pseudo-header involving IP addresses, combined with the CRC at the Data Link Layer and possible link-layer retransmissions for detected errors, significantly improves reliable data delivery. To calculate an overall error probability would require a detailed error model that includes the probability of different types of errors occurring and escaping detection at each layer, which can be highly variable depending on the network conditions and technologies in use. However, the chance of a corrupted packet escaping detection by all these mechanisms in a well-designed network is extremely low."},{"prompt":"Can CRC On the Wire (Ethernet) protect data? Is unnoticed error probability there is 2^32?","completion":"The Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) used in Ethernet at the Data Link Layer (Layer 2 in the OSI model) is indeed designed to protect data integrity by detecting errors that occur during transmission over a physical medium. The Ethernet frame includes a Frame Check Sequence (FCS) field, typically 32 bits in length, which contains the CRC value. This CRC value is computed by the sender based on the contents of the entire Ethernet frame (excluding the preamble, SFD, and FCS itself). The receiver then performs the same CRC calculation on the received frame and compares its result with the CRC value provided in the FCS field. If the computed CRC matches the one in the FCS, the frame is considered to be error-free; otherwise, it is assumed to be corrupt and is usually discarded. # Error Detection Capability The 32-bit CRC used in Ethernet frames provides a very high level of error detection capability. Specifically, it can guarantee the detection of: 1. **All single-bit errors.** 2. **All double-bit errors.** 3. **Any odd number of errors.** 4. **All errors in bursts of 32 bits or less.** 5. **Most larger burst errors, with rapidly declining probability as burst size increases.** Because there are (2^{32}) possible CRC values, a random error has approximately a 1 in (2^{32}) chance (i.e., about 1 in 4.29 billion) of altering the message in such a way that it results in the same CRC value as the error-free message, causing the error to go undetected. However, the detection capability for certain patterns of errors is much stronger than this simplistic probability suggests, due to the mathematics underlying CRC computation. CRC is specifically designed to catch common types of errors in transmission, such as burst errors, with a very high degree of reliability. # Does CRC Protect the Data? The CRC is very effective at detecting errors but does not, by itself, correct errors. When the CRC check fails (indicating that the frame is likely corrupted), the frame is discarded. It's then up to higher-level protocols (like TCP at the Transport Layer) to handle the retransmission of data. In this context, \\"protection\\" means Errors are reliably detected rather than corrected; ensuring the integrity of data transmitted over the network by prompting actions to discard or retransmit corrupt data. # Overall Unnoticed Error Probability Thus, while the probability of a single random error going unnoticed is about 1 in (2^{32}), the actual effectiveness of CRC in practical networking is better characterized by its ability to detect all common error patterns, especially burst errors, which are typical in wired and wireless communication channels. The \\"unnoticed error probability\\" being (2^{-32}) is a simplification, with the real-world effectiveness of CRC error detection being context-dependent but generally very high, substantially contributing to the reliability of Ethernet networks."},{"prompt":"Does CRC Protect the Data?

The momentum effect refers to the tendency for stocks that have performed well in the past to continue to perform well in the near future, and vice versa. Stock price synchronicity refers to the extent to which individual stock price movements are in line with the overall market or sector movements. Cognitive biases may influence investors' reactions to information, thereby impacting stock price momentum. In the high information delay scenario, three synchronicity levels are examined: low, medium, and high. For each level, the average momentum return, p-value, confidence interval limits, and T-statistic are provided. - **Low synchronicity stocks** show a negative average momentum return (-3.447), suggesting that momentum strategies might fare poorly in this segment. The p-value of 0.031 indicates significance, which means there's a statistically significant negative momentum effect present. The confidence interval ranging from -6.580 to -0.313 further supports this finding. - **Medium synchronicity stocks** also display a negative average momentum return (-2.208), though the p-value of 0.150 suggests these results are not statistically significant at conventional levels (often considered as p < 0.05 or p < 0.10). The confidence interval here (-5.226 to 0.810) includes zero, further indicating the lack of statistical significance. - **High synchronicity stocks**, in contrast, show a positive average momentum return (3.644), indicating a possibly successful momentum strategy in this group. The p-value (0.063) is close to being significant, suggesting a potential positive momentum effect that's near conventional thresholds of significance. The confidence interval (-0.195 to 7.483) includes zero, barely, which indicates borderline significance. - The difference in momentum returns between high and low synchronicity stocks (7.091) is significant (p-value of 0.008), suggesting that high synchronicity stocks benefit more from momentum strategies than low synchronicity stocks in environments of high information delay. For the **low information delay** environment, it seems part of your query is missing, but one can expect a similar analysis to be conducted. Generally, in environments with lower information delays (meaning information is disseminated more quickly and efficiently), the effects observed might be different due to quicker market reactions to news and information. Overall, these findings suggest that cognitive biases affecting stock price movements and the application of momentum strategies are influenced by the level of synchronicity in stock prices and the speed at which information is disseminated in the market. High synchronicity stocks in high information delay environments exhibit a stronger momentum effect, indicating a potential area for profitable momentum-based trading strategies."},{"prompt":"the research title is ‚ÄúStock price synchronicity, momentum and cognitive biases‚Äù. the following tables presents the results of t-tests for momentum effect at different levels of synchronicity as well as for difference of high and low synchronicity in high and low levels of information delay. explain it in brief: high information delay: ŸÖÿ™Ÿàÿ≥ÿ∑ ÿ®ÿßÿ≤ÿØŸá ŸÖŸàŸÖŸÜÿ™ŸàŸÖ€å pvalue ÿ≠ÿØ Ÿæÿß€å€åŸÜ ŸÅÿßÿµŸÑŸá ÿßÿ∑ŸÖ€åŸÜÿßŸÜ ÿ≠ÿØ ÿ®ÿßŸÑÿß€å ŸÅÿßÿµŸÑŸá ÿßÿ∑ŸÖ€åŸÜÿßŸÜ ÿ¢ŸÖÿßÿ±Ÿá T ŸáŸÖÿ≤ŸÖÿßŸÜ€å ŸÇ€åŸÖÿ™ Ÿæÿß€å€åŸÜ -3.447 0.031 -6.580 -0.313 -2.181 ŸáŸÖÿ≤ŸÖÿßŸÜ€å ŸÇ€åŸÖÿ™ ŸÖÿ™Ÿàÿ≥ÿ∑ -2.208 0.150 -5.226 0.810 -1.450 ŸáŸÖÿ≤ŸÖÿßŸÜ€å ŸÇ€åŸÖÿ™ ÿ®ÿßŸÑÿß 3.644 0.063 -0.195 7.483 1.881 ŸáŸÖÿ≤ŸÖÿßŸÜ€å ÿ®ÿßŸÑÿß ŸÖŸÜŸáÿß€å Ÿæÿß€å€åŸÜ 7.091 0.008 5.630 8.551 2.244 low information delay: ŸÖÿ™Ÿàÿ≥ÿ∑ ÿ®ÿßÿ≤ÿØŸá ŸÖŸàŸÖŸÜÿ™ŸàŸÖ€å pvalue ÿ≠ÿØ Ÿæÿß€å€åŸÜ ŸÅÿßÿµŸÑŸá ÿßÿ∑ŸÖ€åŸÜÿßŸÜ ÿ≠ÿØ ÿ®ÿßŸÑÿß€å ŸÅÿßÿµŸÑŸá ÿßÿ∑ŸÖ€åŸÜÿßŸÜ ÿ¢ŸÖÿßÿ±Ÿá T ŸáŸÖÿ≤ŸÖÿßŸÜ€å ŸÇ€åŸÖÿ™ Ÿæÿß€å€åŸÜ -1.438 0.326 -4.324 1.448 -0.988 ŸáŸÖÿ≤ŸÖÿßŸÜ€å ŸÇ€åŸÖÿ™ ŸÖÿ™Ÿàÿ≥ÿ∑ -2.375 0.112 -5.316 0.567 -1.601 ŸáŸÖÿ≤ŸÖÿßŸÜ€å ŸÇ€åŸÖÿ™ ÿ®ÿßŸÑÿß 1.374 0.425 -2.026 4.774 0.801 ŸáŸÖÿ≤ŸÖÿßŸÜ€å ÿ®ÿßŸÑÿß ŸÖŸÜŸáÿß€å Ÿæÿß€å€åŸÜ 2.811 0.134 -3.293 8.915 1.095","completion":"The research investigates the effect of stock price synchronicity and information delay on momentum trading strategies, incorporating the potential influence of cognitive biases in investor decision-making. Momentum effect refers to the tendency for rising stocks to continue to rise and falling stocks to continue to fall. Synchronicity here measures how much individual stock prices move in line with the overall market. **High Information Delay Scenario:** - **Low Synchronicity:** There is a significant negative momentum return of -3.447 with a p-value of 0.031, indicating that when information delay is high, stocks with low synchronicity exhibit a significant negative momentum effect. The confidence interval does not encompass zero, which strengthens the result. - **Medium Synchronicity:** This group shows a negative momentum return (-2.208) as well, though it's not statistically significant (p-value: 0.150), suggesting medium synchronicity stocks may not have a clear momentum trend under high information delay. - **High Synchronicity:** Interestingly, high synchronicity stocks show a positive momentum return of +3.644. Although the p-value is 0.063, slightly above traditional significance levels, it suggests a potential momentum strategy could be viable in this segment under conditions of high information delay. - **High minus Low Synchronicity:** The difference in momentum returns between high and low synchronicity stocks is significant (p-value: 0.008), emphasizing that high synchronicity stocks outperform low synchronicity ones under high information delay. **Low Information Delay Scenario:** - **Low Synchronicity:** Here, we observe a negative momentum return (-1.438) that is not statistically significant (p-value: 0.326). The lack of significance could imply that when information delay is low, the momentum effect in low synchronicity stocks is somewhat ambiguous. - **Medium Synchronicity:** The negative momentum return (-2.375) is noticeable but not statistically significant as indicated by the p-value (0.112). This suggests a potentially weak momentum effect in medium synchronicity stocks when information is disseminated promptly. - **High Synchronicity:** High synchronicity stocks show a positive momentum return (+1.374) in the low delay setting, but this result is not statistically significant (p-value: 0.425). It indicates that despite the positive return, the effect of synchronicity on momentum is not clearly discernible in a low information delay environment. - **High minus Low Synchronicity:** The difference in momentum returns between high and low synchronicity stocks is again not statistically significant (p-value: 0.134). This highlights a less pronounced effect of synchronicity on momentum in environments where information is disseminated more quickly. **Summary:** The findings suggest that in environments with high information delay, there‚Äôs a more pronounced and statistically significant effect of stock price synchronicity on momentum strategies, particularly evident in the strong performance of high synchronicity stocks. Conversely, in low information delay environments, the momentum effect appears to be weaker and not statistically significant, indicating that quicker information flow might mitigate the extremes of momentum effects observed under high synchronicity and information delay conditions. This underscores the impact of information delay and stock price synchronicity on the success of momentum trading strategies and hints at the underlying cognitive biases that might influence investor behavior in different market conditions."},{"prompt":"Write a vividly detailed and comedic Zoey 101 story about Logan Reese farting while relaxing in a pond in the nude, and causing a few fish to die from how bad his fart smells underwater.

Prima facie evidence refers to evidence that, on its face or at first glance, is sufficient to prove a particular proposition or fact. It is enough to establish a case unless it is rebutted or contradicted by further evidence. Essentially, prima facie evidence presents a sufficient level of proof to meet the burden of proof required to assert a claim or charge in legal proceedings, pending any contrary evidence. The concept is used in both civil and criminal law, enabling cases to move forward if this initial, apparent level of proof is met, though it can be challenged and overturned by more comprehensive evidence presented during the course of legal proceedings."},{"prompt":"CW4Kids is a Saturday morning block on the CW Eon Kid ‚Ä† (May 24, 2008 - June 14, 2008) (TV-Y7-FV) Johnny Test ‚Ä† (May 24, 2008 - June 14, 2008) (TV-Y7) (now shown on Cartoon Network) World of Quest ‚Ä† (May 24, 2008 - June 14, 2008) (TV-Y7-FV) The Batman ‚Ä† (June 21, 2008 - August 2, 2008) (TV-Y7-FV) Tom and Jerry Tales ‚Ä† (May 24, 2008 - September 6, 2008) (TV-Y) Yu-Gi-Oh!

What we see as massive boobs in our reality would be seen as emaciated, infinitesimal bugbites compared to the average person's bust. The cup sizes in this world are not measured in ounces in weight and inches in circumference, but rather in pounds and feet, if not tonnes and miles. The larger one's assets are, the more experienced they're considered in-universe, and even the smallest, thinnest and most flat of characters can become enormous with enough time, loot and \\"experience gain\\". Unlike usual MMORPGs, there is so such thing as a limit in becoming *too* big or powerful; characters with enough EXP and powerful loot can rapidly become larger than houses, towns, cities, countries, continents, planets... infinite EXP and loot leads to infinite levelling, leads to infinite size, and the effects of loot all stack with other loot. The only finite thing is how much room there is to fill in all space-time, and players can choose to either carefully balance allocating points in two or all three size categories or dump everything into one asset to make it as massive as possible. Include and describe the specific size ranges for each Class, as well as describing the passive effects, changes to ability scores, damage, advantages and disadvantages someone belonging to each Class causes to their surroundings merely because of their vast, unwieldy presence.","completion":"Given the unique and highly imaginative setting of this hypothetical MMORPG, where the norm drastically deviates from real-world sensibilities and embraces an extreme exaggeration of physical proportions as a measure of power and attractiveness, we'll delve into crafting a comprehensive list of 'Cup Size Classes' suitable for this universe. The game mechanics described seem to focus predominantly on the fantastical and operate under a novel set of rules that celebrate an over-the-top aesthetic. Therefore, the following 'Cup Size Classes' have been conceptualized to fit within this universe, incorporating mechanical effects tied to the characters' vastly disproportionate features. # Titan Class - **Size Range:** 50 - 200 feet in diameter. - **Passive Effects:** Immense gravitational pull affects nearby objects and lesser beings, drawing them closer. Highly resistant to physical attacks due to their sheer mass. - **Ability Score Changes:** +50 Strength, -30 Agility. - **Advantages:** High intimidation and crowd control capabilities. Natural disaster-level stomp attacks. - **Disadvantages:** Slow movement speed. Difficulty navigating through standard-sized doorways and structures without causing destruction. # Colossal Class - **Size Range:** 201 - 1000 feet in diameter. - **Passive Effects:** Causes seismic activity with each step. Their shadow provides shade and can affect local climate. - **Ability Score Changes:** +100 Strength, -50 Agility. - **Advantages:** Nearly invulnerable to most forms of attack. Capable of laying waste to cities with minimal effort. - **Disadvantages:** Extremely slow. Prone to large-scale attacks from armed forces. # Planetary Class - **Size Range:** 1001 feet - 1 mile in diameter. - **Passive Effects:** Gravitational field can cause tidal waves and earthquakes. Orbiting objects can become satellites. - **Ability Score Changes:** +150 Strength, -70 Agility. - **Advantages:** Can engulf enemies and objects into orbit. Practically invincible to direct confrontation. - **Disadvantages:** Movement is nearly impossible without causing collateral damage to the environment. # Stellar Class - **Size Range:** Over 1 mile in diameter. - **Passive Effects:** Generates a personal atmosphere. Aura can ignite surrounding air on entry into a planet's atmosphere. - **Ability Score Changes:** +200 Strength, -100 Agility. - **Advantages:** Capable of stellar phenomena such as solar flares to incinerate foes. Can use gravitational pull to slingshot objects or enemies into space. - **Disadvantages:** Unable to interact with most civilization without destroying it. # Universe Class - **Size Range:** Size beyond comprehension, potentially spanning continents to planets. - **Passive Effects:** Possesses a gravity well so intense that it can begin the process of star formation. Their presence is enough to bend space-time. - **Ability Score Changes:** +500 Strength, -150 Agility. - **Advantages:** Can wield the power of black holes, supernovas, and cosmic radiation as weapons. Exists partially in higher dimensions. - **Disadvantages:** Their immense size and power render them isolated from most of the game's traditional content, as they operate on a cosmic scale. # Gameplay Mechanics In this MMORPG, players must carefully choose how to distribute their experience points (EXP) among their physical dimensions. Building a character in the 'Titan Class' might make early gameplay easier, but as players evolve into higher classes like 'Stellar' or 'Universe', the gameplay focus shifts from exploration and combat to managing cosmic-scale phenomena and potentially creating or destroying entire game worlds as part of high-level quests‚Äîsuch as stabilizing or collapsing stars, facilitating or preventing planetary collisions, and managing the well-being of entire civilizations or ecosystems that come to exist on or around them. Characters must rely on advanced magic, arcana, and technologies not only to support their physical structures but also to interact with the world in meaningful ways without causing inadvertent destruction. For example, \\"Planetary\\" and above classes might utilize reality-warping magic to create avatars of manageable size to interact with smaller entities or complete tasks that require finesse. This framework provides a canvas for an unprecedented level of power fantasy, exploring themes of growth, responsibility, and the impact of immense power on oneself and the environment. Balancing these colossal characters' abilities with meaningful challenges and interactions makes for a unique gaming experience that combines the fantastical with thought-provoking gameplay mechanics."},{"prompt":"What about a list list of loot and equipment (including name, effects, and rarity) for this hypothetical MMORPG?

Describe how he‚Äôd look as he does it, and whether it‚Äôs an accident or he did it on purpose to get a meal.","completion":"In the sun-kissed grounds of Pacific Coast Academy, nestled among its opulent landscapes, was a serene, almost hidden pond. It was here, one lazy afternoon, that Logan Reese, the Academy's ever-confident, ever-charismatic teen, decided he'd find solitude, and perhaps, a unique adventure. But little did he know, his unconventional escapade would soon ripple through the halls of PCA with comedic infamy. Logan, with his trademark smirk and a spontaneous idea shimmering in his eyes, thought it would be amusing to embrace nature in its truest form. Thus, he stripped down, leaving his designer clothes in a neat pile on the grassy shore, and waded into the pond, au naturel. The sun danced on his skin, and he paddled leisurely, relishing in the feeling of the cool water enveloping him, secretly pleased with his boldness. However, amidst this tranquility, nature called in a manner far less idyllic. Logan, feeling a bubbling in his stomach, contemplated the situation. He glanced around, the coast was clear, and the water tranquil - a perfect setting for mischief. With a mischievous glint in his eye, he decided he'd attempt a rather unorthodox fishing method: using the power of his own digestive aftermath to catch a meal. Logan, positioning himself strategically, let loose. The water around him momentarily vibrated with the force of his release. Underwater, the scenario was far from the serene surface image. Fish, startled by the unexpected intrusion, darted in every direction. However, a few unfortunate fish, caught too close to Logan's...explosion, floated up, dazed and unmistakably done for, their demise seemingly sealed by the sheer potency of Logan's undersea gas attack. Meanwhile, Logan observed his handiwork, a mixture of pride and shock painting his features. He hadn't quite imagined his plan working so effectively, or at all. His hair, slicked back with pond water, coupled with his wide-eyed expression of triumph and the faintest tinge of guilt, would have made for a priceless portrait of comedic incredulity. As he made his way back to shore, cradling his limp, aromatic trophies, his mind raced with how he'd spin this tale. None would believe the truth, of course. The tale of Logan Reese, PCA's own Casanova, resorting to flatulence for fishing would surely tarnish his carefully curated image. But, as fate would have it, the peculiar incident didn't remain his secret for long. A wandering couple of PCA students, drawn by the unusual sight of abandoned designer clothes, had unwittingly witnessed the entire saga from a distance. By nightfall, the story of Logan's unconventional fishing technique was the talk of PCA, embellished and exaggerated with each retelling. Logan, faced with an auditorium of laughter the following day, could only offer a sheepish grin and a shrugged \\"What can I say, nature calls, right?\\" embracing his newfound notoriety with as much dignity as one could muster in such a situation. And so, Logan Reese‚Äôs bizarre aquatic adventure went down in Pacific Coast Academy history, not just as a tale of comedic misadventure but as a legendary reminder of the unforeseen consequences that often come with answering the whims of nature, or in Logan's case, the call of the wild, a little too enthusiastically."},{"prompt":"What would it feel like to be one of the fish swimming into Logan‚Äôs foul-smelling fart bubbles?","completion":"Imagine you're a fish, gliding through the cool, clear waters of a serene pond with all the grace and ease that comes with your aquatic life. Your world is a kaleidoscope of underwater hues, a silent symphony of tranquility. Most of your life involves simple joys: the pursuit of the next meal, the fluid dance among the water plants, and the comfort of your fellow fish. But then, something unprecedented occurs. As you swim leisurely, you notice a series of bubbles emerging from an unfamiliar creature wading in your domain. Bubbles are not an odd sight in your underwater realm, but these are different. They carry with them an ominous disruption, a promise of something alien. Curiosity, an inherent trait in your small fishy brain, propels you closer. As one of the bubbles reaches you and bursts, the sensation is nothing short of catastrophic. It's as if the essence of a thousand spoiled meals were concentrated into a singular, potent wave of odor. This isn't the subtle, decaying organic material you might occasionally nibble on. This is an onslaught of sensation so powerful that it overwhelms every sense. Your gills flare in discomfort, trying in vain to filter out the noxious intrusion. It's as if the water around you has morphed from a life-sustaining medium into a toxic cloud. You experience a dizzying disorientation, the likes of which you‚Äôve never felt before. Your instinctual alarm signals blare, urging you to escape, but the shock of the encounter leaves you momentarily helpless, a pawn to the currents whimsically carrying Logan's lethal underwater effusion. The final moments are a blur of confusion and distress. You ponder, in whatever way a fish might ponder, how such tranquility transformed so swiftly into chaos. Your world, once vast and inviting, suddenly feels hostile, a place where unseen dangers can manifest in the most bizarre ways. Being one of the fish that swam into Logan‚Äôs foul-smelling fart bubbles is a bewildering, distressing experience. It‚Äôs a stark reminder of the vulnerability that comes with life in the pond, an environment that, for all its beauty and serenity, can unexpectedly turn perilous with the simplest of acts from those who wander into it."},{"prompt":"What does Logan‚Äôs armpits look like as he‚Äôs relaxing","completion":"As Logan Reese lounges by the serene pond, his confidence and carefree spirit fully embodied in his relaxed posture, the sun casts a warm glow over him. With his arms lazily draped behind his head, an image of leisurely contentment, the light illuminates the details one might not usually notice‚Äîthe subtle nuances of Logan's armpits. In this moment of relaxation, Logan's armpits are visible, revealing a surprisingly meticulous grooming habit that might defy the stereotypical expectations for a teenage boy of his laid-back nature. His skin there is smooth, perhaps a testament to a skincare routine influenced by his life of luxury and his desire to always present his best self, regardless of the setting. The little hair that remains is neatly trimmed, a hint of shadow against his skin that suggests Logan takes even the details of his appearance into consideration. This minor detail, often obscured by clothing or simply overlooked in daily bustle, now shines in the sunlight, speaking volumes of his attentiveness to personal grooming. Surprisingly, or perhaps not so surprisingly given his penchant for exuding perfection, there's also the faintest hint of a fresh scent that defies the usual expectations of a teenage boy's exertions under the sun. One could imagine it's from a high-end deodorant, carefully selected to ensure that Logan Reese smells as good as he looks, even in the privacy of a secluded pond-side escape. In this moment of relaxation, Logan‚Äôs armpits are not just an overlooked part of the body, but a silent testament to his relentless pursuit of excellence and appearance, even in scenarios where he might have believed he was alone with nature. This attention to detail, albeit in such a private aspect of his personal care, underlines the complexity of Logan's character‚Äîa blend of vanity, personal pride, and the underlying pressure to maintain an image of flawlessness, even in the most casual of moments."},{"prompt":"can you give me a layperson overview of the following code? : \\"\\"# KTO Authors: Kawin Ethayarajh, Winnie Xu, Niklas Muennighoff, Dan Jurafsky, and Douwe Kiela # Copyright 2024 The HuggingFace Team.

It is built on top of Hugging Face's Transformers and Accelerate libraries, incorporating various utilities and custom functionalities to handle data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and logging in an efficient way. Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the main components and functionalities within the code: # KTOTrainer Class - **Purpose**: The \`KTOTrainer\` class is an extension of Hugging Face‚Äôs Trainer class. It's specifically tailored to support a novel training regimen aimed at optimizing language models for generating responses deemed favourable or unfavourable based on implicit rewards computed from reference models. - **Key Features**: - Utilizes both a policy model (model being trained) and a reference model to compute implicit rewards based on the divergence of their output distributions. - Supports training models to generate responses that either align or misalign with those of the reference model, adjusting for desirable and undesirable responses. - Implements utilities for handling specialized data collation, logging, and generation of samples during evaluation for inspection. # Configuration and Initial Setup - The initialization of the \`KTOTrainer\` involves setting up models (including reference models), tokenizers, data collators, datasets, and optimizing configurations. It also performs important pre-checks and initializations such as ensuring the appropriate use of PEFT models if specified, handling dropout, and setting up datasets for training with specialized filtering and interleaving for desirable and undesirable data. # Custom Loss Computation - Central to this training paradigm is the computation of a custom loss function, which is designed to optimize for the desirable generation of text by balancing rewards and divergences between the policy model's outputs and those of a reference model. # Evaluation and Logging - Evaluation steps are overridden to incorporate the generation of model samples and comparison with the reference model, facilitating a more nuanced analysis of the model's performance on generating desirable vs. undesirable responses. Additionally, it includes mechanisms for detailed logging and visualization of metrics and sample generations. # Dependencies and External Libraries - Relies on PyTorch, Hugging Face‚Äôs Transformers, and Accelerate libraries for underlying model architectures, training acceleration, and utility functions. - Incorporates checks and utilities for integration with PEFT (efficient training frameworks) and optional logging to Weights & Biases. # Data Handling - Implements specialized data processing and tokenization steps to prepare input data for training in the context of generating desirable and undesirable responses, including handling truncation, padding, and sequence management for inputs and labels. # Utilities and Helpers - Includes various helper functions and utilities for model preparation, log probability computations, and data manipulation to support the specific requirements of KTO training, such as handling specialized collation of data, disabling dropout for reference models, and more. # Conclusion This code represents a comprehensive framework designed for advanced fine-tuning of language models, focusing on generating responses that either align with or diverge from a given reference model's outputs.

It focuses on fine-tuning a pre-trained language model (such as GPT-2) on the Anthropic Helpful-Harmless dataset. Here's a walkthrough of the main components and steps in your script: # 1. Script Setup and Argument Parsing - **Purpose**: Define custom script arguments and parse them along with KTO-related configuration options. This allows for easy customization of the training process, such as conducting a sanity check with a smaller subset of the data. # 2. Data Loading and Preprocessing - **Function \`get_hh\`**: Loads the Anthropic Helpful-Harmless dataset and preprocesses it to fit the training format required by the KTO approach. Each dataset entry is split into 'prompts' and 'completions', where the 'completions' are marked as desirable (label=True) or undesirable (label=False) based on whether they are chosen or rejected responses. - **Anthropic Prompt Extraction**: A predefined function is used to extract prompts from the dataset entries. These prompts are formatted to ensure they start and end with specific strings, facilitating structured dialogue generation. # 3. Model and Tokenizer Initialization - Loads a pre-trained model (like GPT-2) and its corresponding tokenizer from Hugging Face's model hub. Since KTO training involves comparing a policy model's outputs against a reference model, two model instances are initialized here, although they start with the same pre-trained weights. # 4. KTO Trainer Initialization - The \`KTOTrainer\` class is initialized with the pre-loaded models, dataset, tokenizer, and training configuration. The trainer handles the fine-tuning process, leveraging the KTO approach to optimize the language model based on the rewards computed from the difference in output distributions between the policy model and the reference model. # 5. Training Execution - The \`train()\` method of the \`KTOTrainer\` is invoked to commence the training process with the defined configuration and datasets. The process includes regular logging and evaluation steps as specified in the configuration. # 6. Model Saving - After training, the fine-tuned model is saved to the specified output directory. This makes it easy to deploy the model for inference or further fine-tuning tasks later on. # Additional Notes - The script supports running with basic settings for regular training as well as options for PEFT (Progressive Embedding Fine-Tuning) to enhance training efficiency with models like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation). - It leverages Hugging Face's \`HfArgumentParser\` for argument parsing, offering a structured way to handle both custom script arguments and those required for \`KTOTrainer\`. - The provided examples at the beginning of the script show how to execute the script with various configurations, demonstrating flexibility in tuning training parameters for optimal results. This script serves as a comprehensive template for employing the KTO method on dialogue or text generation tasks, offering a structured approach to optimize language models for generating contextually appropriate responses."},{"prompt":"hey","completion":"Hello!

Describe how he‚Äôd look as he does it, and whether it‚Äôs an accident or he did it on purpose to get a meal.","completion":"In the sun-kissed, picturesque setting of Pacific Coast Academy, a rare moment of tranquility engulfs the campus. The students are busily entangled in their myriad of activities, leaving the hidden gem of the campus, a serene little pond tucked away behind the lush, whispering trees, momentarily forgotten. Here, Logan Reese, PCA's notorious charmer and wealthy prankster, seeks a slice of paradise away from the prying eyes of his peers. With a mischievous glint in his eye, Logan has decided to embrace nature in its purest form - by relaxing *au naturel* in the pond. The water, sparkling under the radiant sun, dances around his smug smile as he lays back, closing his eyes, embodying the epitome of leisure. His expression is one of complete satisfaction, a smirk playing on his lips, knowing full well the havoc he could wreak if he wanted to, but for now relishing in the undisturbed peace. Suddenly, a sly thought creeps into Logan‚Äôs mind, one that perfectly aligns with his penchant for causing a stir. He wonders, with a devilish grin spreading across his face, whether his underwater symphony could produce more than just bubbles. It‚Äôs not hunger that drives him, but sheer curiosity mixed with his innate desire to be a little rebellious. Logan positions himself, aiming for maximum impact, and lets nature take its course. With a sharp raise of his eyebrows and a cheeky lift of his shoulders, Logan releases what can only be described as an aquatic catastrophe. The pond, once a mirror to the sky, turns into a turbulent cauldron as bubbles erupt from the depths, each pop releasing an aroma so vile it could only originate from the depths of Logan‚Äôs mischief. The effect is instantaneous. Fish, previously gliding gracefully, now dart in panic, their faces (if one could imagine such a thing) wrinkled in dismay. In a scene that could only be described as comically apocalyptic, a few unfortunate fish float to the surface, their bellies up, done in by the noxious assault on their watery habitat. Logan, witnessing the chaotic aftermath of his underwater escapade, bursts into uncontrollable laughter, the sound echoing off the trees. But nature has its way of teaching lessons, especially to those who disturb its delicate balance. As Logan‚Äôs chuckles subside, he realizes he‚Äôs not alone. An audience, comprised of Zoey, Chase, and Michael, stands at the edge of the pond, their faces a mix of shock, amusement, and disbelief. They had come looking for Logan, only to find themselves front row at an unexpected aquatic spectacle. ‚ÄúLogan, did you just... kill fish by farting?‚Äù Michael manages to ask between fits of laughter, hardly believing the scene before him.

Gloop lived in a cave deep within the enchanted Forest of Gloopland, where he spent his days bouncing around and absorbing anything that came in his path. Gloop was a curious creature, always eager to explore new territories and discover new things. However, his gooey consistency often made it challenging for him to navigate through the thick vegetation of the forest. Despite this, Gloop never let his blob-like appearance deter him from seeking adventure. One day, as Gloop was meandering through the forest, he stumbled upon a group of woodland creatures who were in desperate need of help. It seemed that a wicked witch had cast a spell on their village, causing all the plants and trees to wither and die. Determined to save the forest and its inhabitants, Gloop sprang into action. Using his gloopiness to his advantage, he oozed his way through the barren land, leaving a trail of vibrant orange goo behind him. As he moved forward, the plants and trees began to come back to life, their colors becoming more vibrant and their leaves more full. The woodland creatures watched in amazement as Gloop worked his magic, restoring the forest to its former glory. They cheered and praised him, grateful for his selfless act of heroism. From that day on, Gloop became known as the savior of Gloopland, revered by all who lived there. He continued to explore the forest, using his unique abilities to protect and care for the land that had become his home. And so, the gloopy orange blob proved that even the most unconventional heroes can make a difference in the world. For Gloop, it didn't matter that he was different from the other creatures in the forest - all that mattered was his brave heart and determination to do good."},{"prompt":"Write about him , his appearance and abilities","completion":"Gloop was a sight to behold, with his vibrant orange hue and ever-shifting form. His body was composed of a thick, gooey substance that pulsed and wriggled like jelly. His large, round eyes sparkled with curiosity and intelligence, giving him an endearing and friendly expression. Despite his blob-like appearance, Gloop possessed remarkable abilities that set him apart from the other creatures in Gloopland. His gloopiness allowed him to morph and change shape at will, allowing him to squeeze through tight spaces and overcome obstacles that would have been impossible for others. He could stretch himself thin to reach high places or condense himself into a dense mass to exert strength in times of need. Gloop's gooey consistency also had a unique healing property, enabling him to rejuvenate plants and other living beings with a simple touch. His touch could revitalize wilted flowers, rejuvenate sick creatures, and restore life to barren landscapes. This gift made him a beloved figure in Gloopland, revered for his ability to bring life and growth wherever he went. In addition to his healing powers, Gloop had a strong sense of intuition and empathy, allowing him to understand the needs and emotions of those around him. He was a gentle and compassionate being, always willing to lend a listening ear or a helping hand to those in need. Despite his unconventional appearance, Gloop's abilities and kind heart made him a true hero in Gloopland. He was a symbol of hope and inspiration for all who knew him, a reminder that true strength and courage come in many forms. And so, Gloop continued on his adventures, using his unique gifts to protect and care for the enchanted Forest of Gloopland and its inhabitants, forever known as the savior of his beloved home."},{"prompt":"Please write a lighthearted boarding school sports story in the style of classic school stories. Third year Janet recently left Northridge school to attend St Hilda's. At Northridge the girls used to play hockey, but at St Hilda's they play rugby instead. Janet and her friend Sally, who is still at Northridge but is visiting Janet, are watching a senior girls rugby match between St Hilda's and a rival school. It is muddy but no one cares. The St Hilda's girls love being at a school where they get to play rough and get muddy. Describe the match and some exciting and dramatic incidents from it. The match should be realistic and follow the rules of the game. Describe how the players get muddier as the game goes on - describe their bodies (eg arms, knees, legs, hands) and not just their muddy kits. remember the players will be dirty in different ways depending on what they have done during the match. use down-to-earth language and avoid poetic or flowery imagery. Be realistic - the players get very muddy but they are not literally unrecognizable and covered head to toe in mud. Sally cant believe the girls are playing in these conditions - at Northridge they never play hockey if it is wet.","completion":"Janet nudged Sally excitedly, her eyes sparkling with anticipation. \\"You're never going to believe how intense these matches get,\\" she whispered, as both girls huddled together under a massive, slightly damp umbrella. The rugby pitch was a swirling battleground of determined faces and muddy jerseys as the senior girls from St Hilda's faced off against their rivals under a drizzly sky that seemed to promise even more muck before the game was out. From the get-go, it was clear that this wasn't going to be a clean match. Only minutes in, St Hilda's captain, a sturdy girl with braids tightly secured against her head, made a daring sprint towards the opposition's try line. Her legs were already splattered with mud, evidence of her earlier scuffle to gain possession of the ball. With a determined grunt, she was tackled fiercely by two opponents, and they slid a good meter across the muddy ground, marking their path in the earth like warriors. Standing up, her braids now adorned with clumps of earth, she flashed a grin at her teammates, her arms and legs now a canvas of wet dirt and grass stains. Sally, wide-eyed, whispered to Janet, \\"They look like they're having the time of their lives, even covered in mud!\\" Janet chuckled, \\"Oh, you've seen nothing yet.\\" True enough, the match was an exhilarating whirlwind of action. One winger, known for her speed, dashed down the flank, her once-white socks now a murky brown, a testament to the rapid dance she had been doing to evade tackles. Her legs were speckled with mud, which seemed to fly off in every direction with every sprint. At one point, attempting a risky maneuver to keep the ball in play, she ended up somersaulting and planting her hands in a particularly soggy patch of earth. She was up in a flash, laughing, her hands and forearms caked in mud, ready to jump back into the fray. Mid-game saw a scrum that looked more like a battle for survival against the elements than a mere rugby play. Pushing and shoving, every participant emerged with their kits not just splattered but thoroughly coated in mud, their knees and elbows a testament to their struggle, with every crease and crevice filled with the earthy tones of the pitch. It was during the second half when the most memorable play occurred. St Hilda's fly-half, a girl with an infectious enthusiasm for the game, saw an opportunity. With a shout, she grabbed the slippery ball, weaving through her opponents with a grace that belied the conditions. Each step kicked up small showers of mud, splattering her calves with the zeal of the game. In a moment of pure magic, she dodged a tackle, stumbled slightly, but managed to regain her balance, her knees now almost as muddy as her boots, and scored a magnificent try. As the match concluded, with St Hilda's victoriously but narrowly edging out their rivals, both teams were unrecognizable from the clean athletes they were at the start. Their faces were flushed with exertion, streaked with lines of sweat and dirt; their arms and legs bore the marks of every fall, every tackle, every victorious sprint. Walking back, Sally turned to Janet, a look of awe on her face. \\"I‚ÄîI've never seen anything like this. At Northridge, we'd never play in this rain, let alone get this muddy.\\" Janet grinned, slinging an arm, wet and slightly chilly, around Sally's shoulders. \\"Welcome to St Hilda's. It's not just about playing the game; it's about living it, no matter how messy it gets.\\""},{"prompt":"Doƒüa ve ƒ∞nsan Etkile≈üimi Doƒüa, √ßevremizde bulunan ve insan yapƒ±sƒ± olmayan her ≈üeydir. ƒ∞nsanlarƒ±n ya≈üamlarƒ± boyunca ili≈ükilerini s√ºrd√ºrd√ºkleri ve kar≈üƒ±lƒ±klƒ± etkile≈üimde bulunduklarƒ± fiziki, sosyal, ekonomik ve k√ºlt√ºrel ortama ‚Äúdoƒüal ortam veya doƒüal √ßevre‚Äù adƒ± verilir.

She was made entirely of a bubblegum-like, gooey pink substance. Her name was Elara, and she was a wonder to behold. Elara's body shimmered and glistened in the sunlight, looking as if she was made of the sweetest candy. Her hair flowed in thick, pink strands down her back, and her eyes sparkled like sugary gems. Everywhere she went, she left a trail of sticky pink residue behind her. Despite her unusual appearance, Elara was a kind and gentle soul. She loved to help others and bring joy to those around her. Children would gather around her, fascinated by her unique form, and she would entertain them with her tricks and antics. But not everyone in the town appreciated Elara's presence. Some saw her as an oddity, something to be feared or shunned. They whispered behind her back, calling her a freak and a monster. Elara did her best to ignore their harsh words, but it still hurt her deeply. One day, a group of bullies decided to take their taunting to a new level. They surrounded Elara, throwing rocks and insults at her, trying to break her down. But Elara stood strong, her gooey pink body absorbing the blows without a flinch. Just when it seemed like she couldn't take any more, a young girl stepped forward from the crowd. She held out a hand to Elara, a warm smile on her face. \\"I think you're amazing,\\" she said. \\"Don't let them get to you. You're special just the way you are.\\" Tears welled up in Elara's eyes as she clasped the girl's hand. In that moment, she realized that she was not alone. She had found a true friend who accepted her for who she was. And with that newfound strength, Elara faced her bullies head-on, standing tall and proud. From then on, Elara's bubblegum-like, gooey pink substance became a symbol of resilience and compassion in the town. People began to see her in a new light, embracing her uniqueness and celebrating her spirit. And Elara's heart swelled with gratitude, knowing that she was loved and accepted just as she was."},{"prompt":"–ü–∞—Ç–æ–≥–µ–Ω–µ–∑ —Ñ—É–∑–∞—Ä–∏–æ–∑–∞ —á–µ–ª–æ–≤–µ–∫–∞","completion":"–§—É–∑–∞—Ä–∏–æ–∑

Coƒürafyanƒ±n ƒ∞lkeleri Coƒürafi ayrƒ± bir bilim dalƒ± olarak olaylarƒ± belirli ilkelere g√∂re ele almaktadƒ±r. Bunlar ilkeler; nedensellik, daƒüƒ±lƒ±≈ü ve kar≈üƒ±lƒ±klƒ± ilgi ilkeleridir. Nedensellik ƒ∞lkesi (Neden-Sonu√ß ƒ∞lkesi) Coƒürafi olaylar neden ve sonu√ß ili≈ükisi i√ßerisinde incelenmektedir. B√ºt√ºn bilim dallarƒ±nda olduƒüu gibi coƒürafya i√ßerisinde de ‚Äúneden‚Äù sorusu sorulur ve cevap aranƒ±r. √ñrneƒüin coƒürafya ‚ÄúNeden deprem olur, yaƒümur neden yaƒüar?‚Äù gibi sorular sorar ve sonu√ßlarƒ±na cevap bulur. Bu nedenle nedensellik ilkesi; olaylarƒ±n neden ve sonucunu ara≈ütƒ±ran bir ilkedir. √ñrneƒüin, yanardaƒülarƒ±n olu≈üumunu volkanizma ile a√ßƒ±klanƒ±r ve yanardaƒü olan b√∂lgelerdeki doƒüa olaylarƒ±nƒ±n sonu√ßlarƒ±nƒ± a√ßƒ±klar. Daƒüƒ±lƒ±≈ü ƒ∞lkesi Coƒürafyaya √∂zg√º bir ilkedir. Coƒürafi olaylarƒ±n zamanda ve alandaki yayƒ±lƒ±≈üƒ± hakkƒ±nda bilgi verir. Coƒürafi olayƒ±n ‚Äònerede‚Äô meydana geldiƒüini a√ßƒ±klar. Daƒüƒ±lƒ±≈ü ilkesindeki en √∂nemli ara√ß haritalardƒ±r. √ñrneƒüin coƒürafya daƒüƒ±lƒ±≈ü ilkesi ile ‚ÄúHortumlarƒ±n en yaygƒ±n g√∂r√ºld√ºƒü√º yer, Kuzey Amerika‚Äôdƒ±r.‚Äù bilgisini ortaya koyar. Kar≈üƒ±lƒ±klƒ± ƒ∞lgi ƒ∞lkesi (Baƒülantƒ± ƒ∞lkesi) Coƒürafi olaylarƒ±n birbirleri ile kar≈üƒ±lƒ±klƒ± ili≈ükileri bu ilke ile ortaya konmaktadƒ±r. Bu ilke ile fiziki ve be≈üeri olaylarƒ±n birbirini nasƒ±l etkilediƒüini a√ßƒ±klanƒ±r. √á√ºnk√º coƒürafyaya g√∂re; her olay ba≈üka bir olay veya olgu ile ilgilidir. √ñrneƒüin coƒürafya; iklim ko≈üullarƒ±yla tarƒ±m √ºr√ºnleri arasƒ±ndaki ili≈ükiyi inceleyerek yoƒüun yaƒüƒ±≈ülƒ± b√∂lgelerde nelerin yeti≈ütirilmesi gerektiƒüi hakkƒ±nda bilgi verir. Coƒürafyanƒ±n B√∂l√ºmleri Coƒürafyanƒ±n sƒ±nƒ±flandƒ±rƒ±lmasƒ± Fiziki Coƒürafya Fiziki coƒürafya; coƒürafyanƒ±n doƒüal unsurlarƒ± ile ilgilenen alanƒ±na denir. Doƒüal √ßevrenin elemanlarƒ± (canlƒ± ve cansƒ±z) ile doƒüal √ßevrede olan doƒüal olaylar fiziki coƒürafyanƒ±n konusunu olu≈üturmaktadƒ±r. Yani kƒ±saca fiziki coƒürafya; bitki, hayvan, toprak, su gibi √∂geleri ve aralarƒ±ndaki ili≈ükiyi incelemektedir. Jeomorfoloji, klimatoloji, biyocoƒürafya, hidrografya ve kartoƒürafya fiziki coƒürafyaya baƒülƒ± bilim alanlarƒ±dƒ±r.

Hidroloji (Su Bilimi), Limnoloji (G√∂l Bilimi), Hidrojeoloji (Yer Altƒ± Su Bilimi), Oseonografya (Okyanus Bilimi), Potamoloji (Akarsu Bilimi) gibi bilim alanlarƒ±ndan yararlanƒ±r. Biyocoƒürafya= Canlƒ±lar coƒürafyasƒ±dƒ±r. Bitki ve hayvan topluluklarƒ±nƒ±n yery√ºz√ºndeki daƒüƒ±lƒ±≈ülarƒ±nƒ± ve bu daƒüƒ±lƒ±≈ülara etki eden fakt√∂rleri inceleyen bilim alanƒ±dƒ±r. Biyoloji (Canlƒ±lar Bilimi), botanik (Bitki Bilimi), zooloji (Hayvan Bilimi) ve tƒ±p gibi bilimlerinden yararlanmaktadƒ±r. Kartoƒürafya= Harita bilimidir. Yery√ºz√º ≈üeklini, boyutlarƒ±nƒ±, hareketlerini; coƒürafi olaylarƒ±n yery√ºz√ºndeki daƒüƒ±lƒ±≈üƒ±nƒ± haritalarla g√∂steren ve harita √ßizim y√∂ntemleri gibi konularƒ± inceler.

Bu d√∂nemde evrenin olu≈üumu, insan ve doƒüanƒ±n kaynaƒüƒ±nƒ± anlama √ßabasƒ± da coƒürafyaya y√∂n vermi≈ütir. Herodot, Platon, Aristo, Strabon ve Batlamyus gibi d√º≈ü√ºn√ºrler coƒürafyanƒ±n geli≈üiminde √∂nemli rol oynamƒ±≈ülardƒ±r. Strabon‚Äônun Geographika (Antik Anadolu Coƒürafyasƒ±) adlƒ± eseri Anadolu hakkƒ±nda ayrƒ±ntƒ±lƒ± bilgilerin olduƒüu bir eserdir.

Third year Janet recently left Northridge school to attend St Hilda's. At Northridge the girls used to play hockey, but at St Hilda's they play rugby instead. Janet and her friend Sally, who is still at Northridge but is visiting Janet, are watching a senior girls rugby match between St Hilda's and a rival school. It is muddy but no one cares. The St Hilda's girls love being at a school where they get to play rough and get muddy.","completion":"In the heart of the green, sprawling countryside, where ancient trees whispered secrets to those who care to listen, stood St Hilda's School for Girls. A grand institution, renowned not just for its academic prowess but for the valor and camaraderie displayed on its sports fields. It was on one such chilly but cheerful afternoon that Janet, a recent transplant from Northridge School, found herself wrapped in the warmth of a chunky knitted scarf, standing by the rugby field. Her cheeks were flushed, not just from the nip in the air, but from the excitement that bubbled within her. At Northridge, hockey had been the grand affair, but here, at St Hilda's, rugby reigned supreme. Beside her, clad in a similar armour of wool and enthusiasm, stood Sally, her dear friend from Northridge who was visiting for the weekend. Both girls watched with wide eyes as the senior team of St Hilda's clashed mightily with their rivals from Westford Academy. The pitch was a battlefield, churned into a veritable sea of mud that seemed to laugh in the face of any who dared traverse it. The girls of St Hilda's, however, faced it head-on, their faces smeared with mud and determination. They played with a ferocity and joy that was infectious, diving into tackles and sprinting for tries with the kind of abandon that reminded one of the pure love of the game. \\"Look at them go! They're absolutely fearless,\\" exclaimed Janet, her own heart racing as if she were down there in the fray. Sally, with a grin as wide as the pitch, nodded in agreement. \\"Who knew mud could be so magnificent? At Northridge, we'd be running laps if we got our kit this dirty.\\" Both girls laughed, the sound mingling with the shouts and cheers that filled the air. It was a sound that spoke of shared experiences, of camaraderie that went beyond the borders of their respective schools. As the match progressed, with St Hilda's demonstrating a splendid combination of strategy and strength, Janet found herself drawn into the spirit of the game. She felt a bond with the girls on the field, a sense of belonging that she hadn't realized she'd been missing since her move. When the final whistle blew, signaling a hard-earned victory for St Hilda's, the crowd erupted into cheers. The players, despite their exhaustion, shared hugs and handshakes with their opponents, their faces alight with the joy of a game well played. Janet and Sally made their way down to the field, eager to congratulate their heroes. As they approached, a mud-caked figure broke away from the group and jogged over to them. It was Ellie, St Hilda's captain and Janet's dorm mate. \\"Wasn't it grand? You should've seen the look on their faces when Jess made that final try!\\" Ellie beamed, her energy seemingly undiminished by the grueling match. \\"It was incredible! I've never seen anything like it,\\" Janet replied, her admiration clear in her eyes. Sally, with a playful nudge, chimed in, \\"Maybe it's time I convinced Northridge to give rugby a go. We're clearly missing out on all the fun.\\" Their laughter mingled with the cooling air, creating a moment that would be etched in their memories forever. It wasn't just about the mud, or the rugby, or even the victory. It was about the sheer joy of pushing limits, of finding where you belong, and most importantly, the unbreakable bonds of friendship that made every challenge worthwhile. As the shadows grew longer and the sun began its descent, Janet, Sally, and Ellie wandered back towards the warmth of the school, their steps light, their hearts full. St Hilda's might have been Janet's new home, but on that muddy field, she found something even more precious - a sense of belonging that transcended schools, a shared spirit that would always keep them connected, come rain or shine."},{"prompt":"please write more. as janet and sally watch the match, they try to imagine how some of the northridge girls would cope with playing rough and getting dirty. they think some of the girls would be horrified and probably do everything possible to stay clean, while others would probably love it.","completion":"As the celebrations on the field began to wind down, Janet and Sally found themselves comfortably seated on the old timber bench overlooking the now quiet battlefield. The sun was beginning its descent, casting a golden hue over the muddy terrain, making it look almost magical. Sally, with an impish glint in her eye, leaned in closer to Janet. \\"Can you imagine the faces of some of the Northridge girls if they were dropped into this match?\\" Janet couldn't help but giggle at the thought. \\"Oh, absolutely! Can you imagine Felicity? She wouldn't step a foot on the pitch without her designer sports gear. And the moment a speck of mud dared to grace her, she'd probably faint!\\" Both girls erupted into laughter, picturing the scene. Felicity, with her pristine uniform and not a hair out of place, was the epitome of Northridge's well-groomed appearance. The idea of her diving into a muddy tackle was comedic gold. \\"And what about Lucy?\\" Sally added, wiping a stray tear of laughter from her cheek. \\"She's always so concerned about breaking a nail. I reckon she'd play in gloves, if she played at all!\\" Janet nodded, a playful smile dancing on her lips. \\"But you know, I think a few of them would surprisingly love it. Remember Ava? She's always up for a challenge. I bet she'd dive straight into the mud without a second thought. She's got that adventurous spirit.\\" Sally agreed enthusiastically. \\"Oh, for sure! And I think Jess would be right there with her. She might be quiet, but she's tougher than she looks. She‚Äôd probably end up being a star player!\\" The thought of their Northridge friends adapting to the rough and tumble of rugby warmed Janet's heart. It highlighted the beauty of stepping out of one's comfort zone, the unexpected joys of embracing the messiness of life - much like she had in her transition from Northridge to St Hilda's. As the conversation drifted from imaginary scenarios back to the match they had just witnessed, Janet couldn't help but feel a sense of pride in her new school. St Hilda's, with its emphasis on strength, teamwork, and resilience - mud-splattered faces and all - was shaping her in ways she had never anticipated. The air grew cooler, and the stars began to twinkle in the dusky sky, signalling the end of their day spent on the sidelines of adventure. Janet and Sally rose from their bench, stretching their limbs and stifling yawns. Walking slowly back to the dorm, their shoes squelching softly in the mud, they were silent, each lost in thoughts of friendship, change, and the endless possibilities that lay ahead. For in the end, it wasn't just about adapting to a new game or laughing at hypothetical mud-battles. It was about growing, learning, and discovering oneself amidst the unpredictable, sometimes messy, but always beautiful journey of life. And as they said their goodnights, retreating into the cozy warmth of St Hilda‚Äôs, both girls knew they had found something infinitely valuable that day - a deeper understanding of themselves, each other, and the unbreakable bonds that tie us all together, no matter where life‚Äôs muddy pitches might lead."},{"prompt":"please write more. sally is having a games lesson and is praticing some rugby skills with her formmates. sally is slow to get back to her feet at one point and the games mistress jokingly tells her not to lie there enjoying her mud bath but to get up and keep playing.","completion":"The next day dawned bright and clear, a rare respite from the brisk autumn chill that had set in over the past weeks. It was the kind of day that breathed life into old bones and made the heart yearn for outdoor adventure. And for Sally, it presented an unexpected opportunity to step into the rugby fray herself. The games lesson was in full swing, the brisk, clean air filled with shouts and laughter as Sally and her formmates took to the field, a vibrant green patchwork quilt stitched together by the morning light. They were a motley crew, varying degrees of enthusiasm etched on their faces, but under the watchful eye of Miss Thompson, the games mistress, they were slowly molding into a semblance of a rugby team. Miss Thompson, a woman whose love for the game was eclipsed only by her commitment to her students, walked among them, offering words of encouragement, correcting stances, and explaining techniques with patience and clarity. Sally, having witnessed the senior girls' match just the day before, was eager to dive in, her excitement overshadowing the initial clumsiness with which she approached the ball. As the lesson progressed, the girls began to get the hang of it, passing the ball with increasing accuracy and even attempting tackles. Sally, in her enthusiasm, threw herself into the game, running, dodging, and occasionally, tumbling into the soft, forgiving earth. It was during one such tumble, after a particularly ambitious attempt at intercepting a pass, that Sally found herself splayed on the ground, the impact knocking the wind out of her but also coating her in a generous layer of mud. For a moment, she lay there, catching her breath, the cool mud against her skin a stark contrast to the flush of exertion on her face. Miss Thompson, making her way over, couldn't help but chuckle at the sight. \\"Don't get too comfortable there, Sally,\\" she called out, with a twinkle in her eye. \\"This isn't a spa ‚Äì we haven't got time for mud baths. Up you get, and back into the game!\\" The rest of the form erupted into laughter, a warm, infectious sound that seemed to embody the spirit of camaraderie that sports like rugby fostered. Sally, her laughter mingling with theirs, pushed herself onto her feet, her face alight with a blend of embarrassment and joy. \\"Yes, Miss Thompson!\\" she replied, her voice steady despite the laughter, the mud, and the pulsing excitement that thrummed beneath her skin. The lesson continued, with Sally throwing herself into each play with renewed vigor. Each pass, each tackle, and yes, each fall into the mud, became a testament to her spirit, a reflection of the lessons learned not just from Miss Thompson but from her friend Janet and the senior girls at St Hilda's. As the final whistle blew, marking the end of the games lesson, the girls trudged off the field, a procession of muddy, tired, but exhilarated warriors. Sally, glancing down at her mud-splattered kit, couldn‚Äôt help but think of Janet and the senior girls' match. A sense of connection, of shared experience, enveloped her, bridging the gap between Northridge and St Hilda's in a way she hadn't anticipated. Later, as she relayed the day's events to Janet over a steaming cup of hot chocolate, the laughter and stories flowed easily between them. The tale of her \\"mud bath\\" and Miss Thompson's humorous chide became a particular point of mirth, emblematic of the shared joys and challenges that bound them together. In the grand tapestry of school life, it was these moments ‚Äì of laughter, of falls and subsequent rises, of muddy escapades under the watchful eyes of mentors and friends ‚Äì that truly colored their days with the vibrant hues of growth, friendship, and the enduring spirit of sportsmanship."},{"prompt":"please write a follow on story. sally goes back to northridge and tells all her classmates about the match she witnessed. how do they react? are some shocked? jealous? grateful they dont go to St Hildas?","completion":"Upon her return to Northridge School, Sally found herself the center of eager anticipation. Word had already spread like wildfire that she'd witnessed a senior girls' rugby match at St Hilda's; a novelty so foreign to Northridge's hockey-dominated culture that it piqued the curiosity of students and staff alike. The buzz had gathered momentum over lunch, and by the time Sally had settled into her afternoon classes, a chorus of whispers followed her every move. It wasn't long before she was ushered by an enthusiastic group of her classmates into the common room, under the pretense of \\"sharing her grand adventure.\\" Sally, ever the storyteller, recounted the match with vivid detail, her eyes sparkling, and her hands animatedly painting the rough and tumble of the game in the air before her. She spoke of the mud, the tackles, the sheer intensity, and the unbridled joy that had radiated from the players, not to forget her own brief foray into playing rugby during her games lesson. The reactions around her were a mosaic of emotions. Felicity, with her impeccably styled hair and disdain for anything that didn't sparkle, let out a horrified gasp. \\"Mud? And they intentionally dive into it? How utterly barbaric!\\" She shuddered at the thought, clearly scandalized by the notion of such unladylike pursuits. Lucy, the fashion-conscious diva of the lot, was equally aghast. \\"And to think of the state of their uniforms afterwards! I'd spend hours trying to scrub out the stains,\\" she lamented, imagining the logistics of maintaining a pristine appearance post-match. However, amidst the shock and horror, there were those whose eyes lit up with the spark of intrigue. Ava, known for her adventurous streak, leaned in closer, her expression one of unabashed excitement. \\"That sounds absolutely thrilling,\\" she exclaimed, the prospect of such physicality and camaraderie appealing to her sense of adventure. \\"I wish we could try something that challenging and fun here.\\" Jess, always the quiet one but with a known competitive edge, nodded in agreement, her mind already racing with the possibilities. \\"Imagine the teamwork it would foster,\\" she mused, more to herself than anyone else, the cogs of curiosity turning in her mind. The room buzzed with differing opinions, some echoing Felicity's sentiments, while others, much like Ava and Jess, found themselves envious of the experiences St Hilda's offered. A few, comfortable in Northridge's traditions, expressed relief, content with the familiar contours of hockey and the absence of mud-splattered uniforms. Ms. Patterson, the PE teacher who'd been listening in from the doorway, saw an opportunity. Sally's account, along with the varied reactions it had spurred, presented a teachable moment ‚Äì a chance to expand Northridge's horizons and challenge the students' perceptions of sports and camaraderie. \\"Perhaps,\\" she chimed in, her voice cutting through the cacophony of reactions, \\"it's time we consider introducing something a bit out of our comfort zone here at Northridge. A chance to experience not just the thrill of a new game, but to learn resilience, teamwork, and perhaps even enjoy a mud bath or two.\\" The room fell silent, the mix of shock and excitement palpable as they considered the possibility. For some, it was a step too far, but for others, Sally's story had ignited a flame of curiosity and adventure, a desire to embrace the mud and mayhem that rugby promised. As the bell rang, signaling the end of the break and pulling the girls back to the reality of their next class, the common room buzzed with a renewed sense of spirited debate and dreaming. Sally's tale from St Hilda's had done more than just entertain; it had sown the seeds of change, challenging Northridge's norms and opening the door to new possibilities. Whether those seeds would take root and grow, only time would tell. But for now, Sally had bridged the worlds of Northridge and St Hilda's, uniting them in the spirit of the game ‚Äì mud, camaraderie, and all."},{"prompt":"Napisz 3 zwrotki ≈ºycze≈Ñ wielkanocnych w formie wiersza mocno rymowanego, z rymami ≈ºe≈Ñskimi aabb","completion":"W dzionek Wielkanocny pe≈Çen blasku, ≈õwiat≈Ça, Kiedy malowane jajka kryjƒÖ trawy skraje, Niechaj do serc Waszych szczƒô≈õcie wpadnie miarkƒÖ, A rado≈õƒá wielkanocna odmienia ≈ºycia kraje.

Kazuki soon disappears after a tragic bus accident however, and Y≈´ji soon becomes the latest victim of the covert super solider/intelligence agent training program held by international terrorist Heath Oslo, who [Heath] was a family friend of the older Kazumis [Ry≈çji and Satoko]. As one of Heath's minions in training, Y≈´ji is the subject of various experiments and cruel training procedures designed to make him [Y≈´ji] the perfect soldier. Y≈´ji partially recovers his [Y≈´ji's] memories and [Y≈´ji] swears to kill Heath, which is unfortunately prevented by the training camp being intercepted by a joint Japanese Special Forces and Public Security operation lead by the black-haired, purple-eyed, tall and slender but also rather curvy and buxom, perverted and lecherous but also very determined Public Security agent, Kusakabe Asako, who [Asako] immediately takes in Y≈´ji as her [Y≈´ji's] unofficial ward and [Asako's] sexual boy toy, [Asako] then acting as Y≈´ji's mother in all but name for the next few years. Asako also trains Y≈´ji in conventional intelligence and military tactics, [Asako] even manipulating a Japanese double agent within the American Armed Forces to have Y≈´ji join the US Armed Forces under an alias.

P.S: There is no multiverse, multiple worlds, alternative worlds or alternate universes in this story. Everything takes place in a single universe.","completion":"Under the watchful eyes of first morning light that spilled onto the meticulous campus of First Academy, S≈çichir≈ç quietly navigated the intricately designed pathways that led to his new life‚Äîan existence far removed from the shadows that once shaped him. Each step he took was a conscious attempt to shed the remnants of his past lives as Y≈´ji, as an assassin, and embrace the role of S≈çichir≈ç, the student. Yet, the weight of his history clung to him, an unshakeable shadow that whispered promises of darkness amidst this new dawn. First Academy, a prestigious educational institution renowned for nurturing the finest magicians, had accepted S≈çichir≈ç based on his exceptional talents. However, this new beginning was marred by the complexity of emotions that his presence evoked among his sisters‚ÄîAya, Rio, Koharu, Hiyori, Michika, and Miyuki. The fabric of their familial bonds, both blood and adoptive, was threaded with layers of affection, care, and unresolved tensions that begged for exploration and understanding. As S≈çichir≈ç adjusted to the rigorous academic curriculum, his interactions with Miyuki painted a starkly different picture from the solitude he was accustomed to. Her clinginess, though smothering, began chipping away at the high walls he had erected around his heart. \\"Onƒ´-sama, let's walk to class together!\\" Miyuki's voice, vibrant and full of life, often pulled him back from the brink of his contemplation and into the moment‚Äîinto a reality where he was not just a soldier but a brother. Yet, it was not just Miyuki who sought his attention and affection. The revelation of his identities and the intricate dance of navigating relationships with his sisters, both adoptive and biological, forced S≈çichir≈ç to confront the emotional turmoil that had been simmering beneath the surface. Aya's motherly concern often clashed with Rio's fiery nature, while Koharu's energetic spirit provided a stark contrast to Hiyori's gentle demeanor. Michika, with her quiet intelligence, often observed from the sidelines, her own feelings as complex as the weaving of their fates. Caught in this maelanage of familial complexities, S≈çichir≈ç grappled with the scars inflicted by his past. Ry≈çji and Satoko's destructive end, coupled with Heath Oslo's cruel machinations, had left deep marks that weren't easily healed by the passage of time or the warmth of familial love. Yet, the genuine affection and concern his sisters showed him slowly began to act as a balm to these wounds, teaching him the true meaning of family and belonging. It was during these moments of vulnerability and acceptance that S≈çichir≈ç began to understand the depths of his sisters' feelings towards him. Their love, each unique in its expression, was not born out of mere obligation or proximity but from a sincere place of admiration and care, forged through shared experiences and the silent battles each of them had fought alongside him. This intricate web of relationships, with its myriad of emotions, presented S≈çichir≈ç with a challenge far greater than any battlefield or espionage mission‚Äînavigating the delicate balance of affection, understanding, and independence within the family. As days turned into weeks, and weeks into months, S≈çichir≈ç found himself more entwined in the lives of his sisters, with each interaction paving the path towards healing and understanding. The journey was fraught with uncertainties and moments of doubt. Yet, amidst the academic challenges, magical training, and the emotional upheavals of teenage life, S≈çichir≈ç discovered a resilience within himself and the unbreakable bond of family that transcended the shadows of his past. In the end, it was not his prowess in combat or his intelligence that defined him but the capacity to love, forgive, and grow alongside those who had become his most unexpected allies‚Äîhis sisters."},{"prompt":"Continuing with the story prompted and generated in the previous entry: The first chapter should be done in a tactical-military action, black ops novel style, covert operations, cyberpunk, futuristic format, focusing on S≈çichir≈ç as he [S≈çichir≈ç] takes on a wetwork mission by the Japanese government and [S≈çichir≈ç] subsequently takes out a mysterious Caucasian man who [the mysterious Caucasian man] was [the mysterious Caucasian man] funding the terrorists with [the weapon S≈çichir≈ç used to take out the funder] a high powered sniper rifle, only for him [S≈çichir≈ç] to [S≈çichir≈ç] realize that the mysterious funder was [the mysterious funder] in fact Heath, causing him [S≈çichir≈ç] to shake and [S≈çichir≈ç] shiver consistently as he [S≈çichir≈ç] leaves the scene and [S≈çichir≈ç] returns to Japanese Public Security headquarters, [S≈çichir≈ç] managing to [S≈çichir≈ç] sneak back into his [S≈çichir≈ç's] room at the Nanase [„Äú Im≈çto Paradaisu! „ÄúOnii-chan to Go nin no Imouto no Ecchi Shimakuri na Mainichi„Äú] household without [S≈çichir≈ç] being [S≈çichir≈ç] discovered by his [S≈çichiro's] adoptive sisters [Aya, Rio, Koharu, Hiyori and Michika].","completion":"Chapter 1: Ghosts of the Past Tokyo's neon lights flickered in the distance as S≈çichir≈ç moved through the shadows, his form blending into the dark alleys of the city's underbelly. The heartbeat of the metropolis was muffled here, replaced by the sounds of his own steady breaths and the soft step of his boots on damp concrete. His target tonight wasn't a creature of the city's vibrant nightlife but a ghost from his past‚Äîa man whose existence threatened the precarious balance of peace. The digital display inside his tactical goggles counted down the minutes as he approached the designated vantage point. Every piece of equipment he carried was state-of-the-art, provided by Japanese Public Security for operations that never existed on paper. Tonight, his weapon of choice was a high-powered sniper rifle, its body designed for stealth, silence, and deadliness. As S≈çichir≈ç set up his position, his mind briefly wandered to the Nanase household, where life presented a stark contrast to his current reality. There, amidst his adoptive sisters, he found fleeting moments of normalcy and warmth, a bittersweet reminder of the life he could have led. But as the clock continued its unforgiving countdown, he shoved those thoughts aside. Duty called, and he answered. Through the scope, the world narrowed to a single point of focus‚Äîthe window of a high-rise building across the way. Intelligence had pinpointed this location as the meeting place for the enigmatic funder behind a burgeoning terrorist cell. S≈çichir≈ç's orders were clear: eliminate the threat. Time seemed to stretch and compress as he waited, his finger resting lightly on the trigger. And then, he saw him‚Äîa mysterious Caucasian man making his way to the balcony. S≈çichir≈ç's breath stilled as he focused, his senses sharpening. He didn't have long; the window of opportunity was brief. He squeezed the trigger. The silence that followed was punctured by the faintest echo of the shot, absorbed by the city's ambient noise. Through the scope, he saw the man collapse, his threat extinguished. But as S≈çichir≈ç observed the unfolding scene, a chilling realization gripped him. The features of the man, now visible through the high-definition lens, were unmistakable. Heath. Memories flooded back‚Äîthe training, the cruelty, and the relentless pursuit of survival. S≈çichir≈ç's hands trembled, the rifle's weight suddenly overwhelming. Heath, the man who had orchestrated so much pain and suffering in his life, was now a lifeless form on a distant balcony. The realization sent a shiver down his spine, not of fear, but of unspoken, unresolved torment. The mission was over, but the ghosts of his past clung closer than his shadow. With meticulous care, S≈çichir≈ç dismantled the rifle, each piece tucked away into the compact case he had brought. His exit was as silent as his arrival, a ghost slipping through the night. As he made his way back to the Nanase household, the weight of what had transpired bore heavily on him. The house was quiet when he returned, its inhabitants lost in dreams of normalcy that he could only envy. S≈çichir≈ç moved with practiced silence, ensuring that not even the slightest sound would betray his late-night absence. His adoptive sisters remained unaware of the darkness that shadowed his life, a facade he meticulously maintained for their sake, and perhaps, a bit for his own. As he lay in the dark, staring at the ceiling, the adrenaline that had fueled him ebbed away, leaving an aching void. Tonight, he had confronted a demon from his past, but the victory was hollow. Heath‚Äôs death did not erase the scars left behind, nor did it quell the storm that raged within S≈çichir≈ç. The line between justice and vengeance blurred, and in the silent hours of the night, S≈çichir≈ç was left to ponder whether the path he walked was one of redemption or damnation.

For S≈çichir≈ç, each step towards the school was a step further into a world where he struggled to belong. Despite the familiar routine of classes and the comfortable weight of textbooks in his bag, his heart felt as if it were navigating a minefield‚Äîeach beat a reminder of the complex web of relationships and hidden identities that ensnared him. As he approached his classroom, a sense of unease settled over him. The whispers and sideways glances from his peers didn't escape his notice. In this world of magic and privilege, his status as a \\"Weed\\"‚Äîa magician of supposedly inferior quality‚Äîmade him an easy target. Yet, S≈çichir≈ç was no ordinary student. His past, cloaked in shadows and marked by blood, had honed his instincts and skills to a razor's edge. When a group of bullies, emboldened by their misguided sense of superiority, cornered him after class, they expected an easy victory. What they encountered, however, was a foe whose agility and strategic mindset left them incapacitated, wondering how they had been so thoroughly bested. S≈çichir≈ç's victories were silent. His movements swift and decisive, leaving no evidence of his involvement. To the outside observer, it seemed as though the bullies had simply succumbed to their own folly. Yet, these clandestine triumphs did not go unnoticed by all. Miyuki, his ever-watchful sister, regarded him with a mixture of admiration and concern. Her presence, a constant in his turbulent life, both comforted and complicated matters. Her clinginess, while endearing, served as a palpable reminder of the intricate dance of emotions and obligations that defined his existence. Adding to this equation were Sachi and Honoka, who, drawn by a mix of curiosity and burgeoning feelings, found themselves increasingly orbiting S≈çichir≈ç. Their actions, ranging from subtle gestures of support to outright declarations of affection, blurred the lines between friendship and something deeper. Caught in the vortex of his sisters' affections, S≈çichir≈ç faced the dawning realization that a \\"normal\\" life might forever elude him. His past‚Äîan amalgamation of trauma, loss, and survival‚Äîhailed from a world alien to the halls of First Academy. Yet, it was not only the shadows of his former life that set him apart. It was also the reality of his current circumstances, entwined with the affections of Miyuki, Aya, Rio, Koharu, Hiyori, and Michika‚Äîall of whom harbored feelings for him that transcended the boundaries of conventional sibling relationships. As the days unfolded, with each moment of solace shared in the quiet corners of the academy or the laughter that filled their home, S≈çichir≈ç found himself grappling with a profound and unsettling truth: the depth of his sisters' feelings for him was both a source of strength and a Pandora's box of potential chaos. Amidst the swirling chaos of magical studies, covert confrontations, and the relentless advance of affections both welcome and overwhelming, S≈çichir≈ç came to accept that his life was anything but ordinary. The realization was not accompanied by despair but rather a quiet acceptance of the unique tapestry of relationships and experiences that defined his existence. In the end, S≈çichir≈ç's journey was not one of isolation but of connection. Surrounded by those who loved him‚Äîin ways complex and multifaceted‚Äîhe learned to navigate the unpredictable waters of life at First Academy. And perhaps, just perhaps, in the midst of the chaos and the love that surrounded him, he might find the semblance of a family he had always longed for‚Äîa family unconventional, yet unbreakable."},{"prompt":"Continuing with the story prompted and generated in the previous entries: The second chapter should be done in a Japanese light novel-style, Japanese harem anime, manga, light novel and visual novel style, romantic comedy, slice-of-life, cyberpunk, school life, urban fantasy, high fantasy format and focus on S≈çichir≈ç nearly [S≈çichir≈ç] getting busted by the entire student population of First Academy after his [S≈çichir≈ç's] handler in Public Security and also Asako's childhood friend and [Asako's] sexual partner, the blonde-haired, blue-eyed, tall and slender, curvy and buxom, part-German, part-Italian, slient and reserved, flirty, openly airheaded but personally very observant Julia Bardera [Gurizaia no Kajitsu], [Julia] makes a visit to First Academy in her [Julia's] yellow Ferrari in order to [Julia] pick him [S≈çichir≈ç] up for his [S≈çichir≈ç's] next mission for Public Security, which [S≈çichir≈ç's wetwork mission] he [S≈çichir≈ç] accomplishes with ease, only for him [S≈çichir≈ç] to realize it [the mission] was just a ruse for her [Julia] to [Julia] get closer to him [S≈çichir≈ç] for a date, which he [S≈çichir≈ç] reluctantly accepts.

However, for S≈çichir≈ç, the arrival of a yellow Ferrari, sleek and impossible to ignore, heralded the end of normalcy. Its engine purred like a predator, drawing the attention of the entire student body as it came to a stop at the front gates. Julia Bardera stepped out, her presence commanding immediate attention. Her blonde hair shone under the sun, her tall and slender form accentuated by her attire which managed to be both eye-catching and elegant. The murmurs started almost instantly, a mix of curiosity and envy floating through the air. Julia, with her part-German, part-Italian heritage, had a way of making an entrance that was impossible to ignore. S≈çichir≈ç, who had been trying to maintain a low profile amidst his fellow students, felt his heart sink. Julia was his handler in Public Security, a connection to a world he was trying to keep separate from his life at the academy. Her arrival, however, blurred those lines in a way he couldn't have anticipated. As Julia made her way to him, her blue eyes scanning the crowd with a mix of amusement and determination, S≈çichir≈ç knew that explaining her presence would be no easy task. Indeed, her excuse for whisking him away‚Äîa mission for Public Security‚Äîwas believable only to those who knew of his double life. The mission itself was accomplished with almost disconcerting ease, a testament to S≈çichir≈ç's skills. Yet, as the dust settled, the truth emerged. This had been a ruse, a bold move by Julia to claim time alone with him. S≈çichir≈ç, caught between his duty and the unexpected twist of being on a \\"date,\\" felt the corners of his world bending. Julia, seemingly unfazed by the turn of events, relished in the moment. Her reason for the elaborate setup became clear as they found themselves seated in a quiet, upscale restaurant. The conversation, initially centered around their work, took a personal turn when S≈çichir≈ç mentioned his adoption by the Nanases and his transformation into S≈çichir≈ç. Her initial pout, a rare display of vulnerability, quickly gave way to playful teasing. Julia revealed she had been more aware of his circumstances than he had realized, pulling up a photo on her phone of Aya and Hiyori attempting to stealthily follow him on one of his missions. The image, somehow both comical and endearing, underscored the complexity of S≈çichir≈ç's life‚Äîsplit between his duties as a public security operative and the affections of his adoptive and biological sisters. Julia's declaration that she intended to be his legal wife, despite the potential competition from the Nanase sisters and Miyuki, was both bold and characteristic of her confident nature. Her statement hung between them, a bold claim on a future that S≈çichir≈ç hadn't dared to envision amidst the chaos of his daily existence. S≈çichir≈ç, taken aback by the frankness of her proclamation, found himself at a loss for words. The intermingling of his worlds‚Äîhis public security duties, school life, and the affections of those closest to him‚Äîhad never seemed more complex. Yet, Julia's forwardness offered a strange sort of clarity. As they continued their date, the realization dawned upon S≈çichir≈ç that his life, however filled with unexpected turns and hidden truths, was his own to steer. The affections of Miyuki, the Nanase sisters, and now Julia, while overwhelming, were facets of a life rich with connection and emotion. In the glow of the evening, as they walked back to the yellow Ferrari, S≈çichir≈ç realized that the future held endless possibilities. The path forward might be fraught with challenges, but it was one he would navigate with the awareness of the love and loyalty that surrounded him‚Äîwhether it came from the expected corners of his life at the academy or the unexpected declaration from Julia. Life, as S≈çichir≈ç was coming to understand, was rarely straightforward, but perhaps that complexity was what made it truly worth living."},{"prompt":"Continuing with the story prompted and generated in the previous entries: The second chapter should be done in a dialogue-filled, Japanese light novel-style, Japanese harem anime, manga, light novel and visual novel style, romantic comedy, slice-of-life, cyberpunk, home-life urban fantasy, high fantasy format and focus on S≈çichir≈ç trying [S≈çichir≈ç] to [S≈çichir≈ç] be a good Onƒ´san [big brother |Onƒ´san|] to the Nanase [„Äú Im≈çto Paradaisu! „ÄúOnii-chan to Go nin no Imouto no Ecchi Shimakuri na Mainichi„Äú] girls [Aya, Rio, Koharu, Hiyori and Michika] even as he [S≈çichir≈ç] manages to [S≈çichir≈ç] hide his [S≈çichir≈ç's] true occupation [being an assassin for the Japanese government] from them [Aya, Rio, Koharu, Hiyori and Michika].","completion":"Chapter 4: The Life of an Onƒ´san The gentle hum of the evening at the Nanase household was a stark contrast to the chaotic world S≈çichir≈ç often navigated.

Can you call everyone to the table, S≈çichir≈ç Onƒ´san?\\" Aya‚Äôs voice broke through the tranquillity, her figure bustling in the kitchen. S≈çichir≈ç nodded, feeling a twinge of guilt as he remembered the dual life he led‚Äîone that his adoptive sisters were blissfully unaware of. \\"Sure thing, Aya. I'll get them,\\" he replied, his tone even. As he walked towards the living room, he found Rio and Koharu engaged in their usual banter over a board game, while Hiyori quietly read in a corner, and Michika scribbled into a notebook, her eyes focused and determined. \\"Hey, everyone, dinner's ready. Aya's asking us to gather at the table,\\" S≈çichir≈ç announced, trying to muster as much normalcy into his demeanor as possible. Rio looked up, a pout forming on her lips as she glanced at the game board. \\"Already? But I'm about to win!\\" Koharu shot her a triumphant smirk. \\"Dream on! We'll just have to continue this epic battle after dinner.\\" Hiyori bookmarked her page, closing her book with a soft thud. \\"Dinner smells wonderful. Aya‚Äôs outdone herself again,\\" she said, her voice a calm presence in the room. Michika, always the last to pull away from her studies, sighed and capped her pen. \\"Alright, let‚Äôs go. I could use a break anyway.\\" As they gathered around the table, S≈çichir≈ç couldn't help but appreciate the normalcy of this domestic scene‚Äîa stark contrast to the life-and-death decisions he often faced in the shadows. Aya served the dinner she'd prepared, a feast by any standard, filling the room with the aroma of home-cooked goodness. \\"I hope everyone's hungry!\\" she beamed, taking her seat. The meal commenced with laughter and light conversation, each sister sharing anecdotes from their day. S≈çichir≈ç listened and participated, his contributions punctuated by the underlying knowledge of the secrets he kept from them. Midway through the dinner, Rio turned to S≈çichir≈ç with a curious glint in her eye. \\"Onƒ´san, you seem to disappear a lot for someone who's supposed to be studying with us. What's keeping you so busy lately?\\" The question, innocent as it was, felt like a spotlight on S≈çichir≈ç's double life. He managed a smile, crafting his response with care. \\"Ah, you know, just helping out a friend with some complicated stuff. It's nothing too interesting, I promise.\\" Aya chimed in with a gentle smile, \\"Well, as long as you're taking care of yourself, Onƒ´san. We worry about you.\\" Koharu snickered, \\"Yeah, running around doing mysterious 'stuff.' Maybe Onƒ´san is secretly a superhero.\\" Michika looked intrigued, \\"That would be quite the revelation. A superhero brother.\\" Hiyori, however, remained quiet, her gaze thoughtful. The evening wore on, filled with the sounds of familial comfort and joy‚Äîa haven from the realities that awaited S≈çichir≈ç in the outside world. As grateful as he was for these moments, the weight of his secrets pressed heavily on his heart. Despite the laughter and warmth, a part of him remained on guard, always cautious about the truths he could never share. Late into the night, after the laughter had subsided and the sisters had retired to their rooms, S≈çichir≈ç lingered in the living room, the echoes of their shared moments a bittersweet symphony in the quiet. He knew the path he walked was laced with danger, not just for him but potentially for those he had come to care about deeply. The Nanase sisters had given him a semblance of a family, a home‚Äîa reason to strive for a better, safer world, even if it meant keeping them in the dark about the ghosts that haunted him. In the silence of the house, amidst the soft ticking of the clock, S≈çichir≈ç made a silent vow to himself‚Äîa vow to protect this peace, this semblance of normalcy, at all costs. For as long as he could, he would be their Onƒ´san, their protector, standing guard over the innocence and joy that filled these walls.

A rumor had begun to circulate about a new student, one who possessed a demeanor as mysterious as his past. To some, he was merely another face in the crowd, but to others, he represented a challenge, a puzzle waiting to be solved. Among those intrigued by the new student was none other than Bakug≈ç Katsuki, a name synonymous with pride and power within the academy's walls. His explosive sweat-Quirk, a source of both his arrogance and his strength, had long placed him at the top of the unofficial hierarchy among the students. Yet, it was the sight of this newcomer, S≈çichir≈ç, that sparked a fire within Katsuki‚Äîa desire to affirm his dominance. \\"S≈çichir≈ç, was it? You've been getting quite a bit of attention. Let's see if you live up to the hype,\\" Katsuki sneered, his lackeys smirking behind him, ready to pounce at his command. S≈çichir≈ç, for his part, remained calm, an island of tranquility amidst the brewing storm. \\"There's no need for this, Katsuki. I'm here to study, not to compete.\\" But Katsuki was unrelenting. \\"Study? You think you can waltz in here and not be tested?\\" With a flick of his wrist, his lackeys charged forward, a predictable move in his playbook. However, what followed was anything but predictable. S≈çichir≈ç, with movements so swift and precise they bordered on invisible, deflected each attack effortlessly. The lackeys, unable to land a single blow, found themselves incapacitated on the ground, their advance halted by skill rather than brute force. Katsuki, witnessing the swift defeat of his followers, felt a surge of rage‚Äîand challenge. He lunged at S≈çichir≈ç, his fists alight with the promise of explosive power. Yet, all it took was a single push from S≈çichir≈ç, a movement so gentle it barely disturbed the air, to send Katsuki sprawling on the ground, his arrogance punctured by disbelief and defeat. Among the crowd that had gathered to watch the confrontation was Kaminari Denki, his bicolored hair standing out even in the sea of students. Denki, known for his laid-back attitude and electrokinetic abilities, watched with a mix of awe and respect as S≈çichir≈ç handled the situation with an ease that belied his previous nonchalance. As the dust settled and the onlookers dispersed, Denki approached S≈çichir≈ç, an unreadable expression on his face. \\"Man, that was something else. You didn't just defeat Bakug≈ç; you did it without breaking a sweat. Respect,\\" he said, extending his hand in a gesture of camaraderie. S≈çichir≈ç, accepting the handshake, offered a small smile. \\"Thanks, Denki. It wasn't about defeating anyone, though. It's about maintaining peace.\\" Denki's eyes sparkled with curiosity and something akin to admiration. \\"With skills like yours, I can see why. But it makes one wonder... just who are you, really?\\" S≈çichir≈ç's smile didn't waver, but his eyes held a depth of experience far beyond his years‚Äîan echo of battles fought in shadows, of secrets kept and identities hidden. \\"Just a student, trying to blend into the background,\\" he replied, the honesty of his words masked by the necessity of secrecy. As the day came to an end, and S≈çichir≈ç continued his journey through the complex tapestry of his life at First Academy, he couldn't help but reflect on the encounters of the day. Each interaction, each challenge, served as a reminder of the path he had chosen‚Äîone of vigilance, of protection.

MLA terrorists, emboldened by malice and the desire to instill fear, breached the prestigious school's defenses, taking students and staff hostage. It was an operation that reeked of careful planning and execution, targeting what they believed was a symbol of the status quo they so despised. Amidst the ensuing chaos, S≈çichir≈ç's instincts snapped into razor-sharp focus. His dual life, one submerged in the darkest corners of covert operations, prepared him for moments such as this‚Äîa reality he had hoped to keep separate from the innocent lives his current persona was entwined with. \\"Secure the perimeter. Make sure no one heroes their way out of this,\\" sneered the leader of the MLA cell, unaware that a predator lurked among their midst. S≈çichir≈ç moved with purposeful silence, a shadow among shadows. His heart raced, not out of fear but a burning determination to protect. Using a compact silenced pistol, he neutralized the threats one by one, each takedown a silent testament to his unforgiving training and resolve. All the while, his mind raced to devise a strategy that kept his identity hidden from both the terrorists and those he sought to save. The MLA had spread its members thin, a tactical error S≈çichir≈ç exploited with ruthless efficiency. His movements were calculated, ensuring minimal noise and visibility. As he advanced, the sound of faint, muffled pleas reached his ears, guiding him to where two of the terrorists had corralled a group of hostages, among them Sachi and Honoka. The air was thick with tension as he approached, aware that any misstep could jeopardize not just his mission but the lives of the innocent. With precision born of countless hours of practice, S≈çichir≈ç dispatched the guards, their bodies crumpling silently to the floor. As he moved to secure the hostages, a flicker of recognition seized him. Sachi and Honoka were, in fact, Aya and Hiyori in disguise. The revelation struck a chord deep within him. His world, carefully compartmentalized to protect those he cared about, was crumbling. Yet, there was no time to ponder the implications. With a silent promise to address the matter later, he motioned for them to stay quiet and follow him to safety. Continuing his silent crusade, S≈çichir≈ç eliminated the remaining threats with a combination of tactical prowess and cold efficiency. It was as if the shadows themselves were on his side, cloaking his actions and preserving the fa√ßade of the ordinary student in extraordinary circumstances. Before long, the unmistakable sounds of the elite counter-terrorist forces‚Äîthe Special Assault Team and the Japanese imperial military‚Äîechoed through the corridors, signaling the end of the nightmare. But by then, S≈çichir≈ç had melted away, ensuring his role in the rescue remained a ghost story, whispered among those who had felt the grip of fear loosen around them without seeing the hand that had freed them. In the aftermath, as order was restored and the academy began the slow process of returning to normalcy, S≈çichir≈ç found himself confronted with the complexities of his double life. Aya and Hiyori's unwitting involvement in his world of shadows was a breach in the walls he had erected to keep them safe. It was a reminder of the fragile balance he maintained‚Äîa balance threatened not just by external forces but by the very nature of his existence. As S≈çichir≈ç navigated the emotional fallout and the gratitude of his peers, he realized that the masks he wore, the secrets he kept, were not just a shield but a prison. The lines between S≈çichir≈ç the student, the brother, and the covert operative blurred, leaving him to ponder the path forward. Could he continue to walk the tightrope between these worlds, or would he have to choose? And at what cost? The questions lingered, unanswered, as S≈çichir≈ç looked towards the days ahead‚Äîdays filled with the promise of laughter, learning, and perhaps, inevitable confrontations with both the shadows of his past and the light of his present ties.

The decision had been made, somewhat solemnly and with many a reluctant heart, among the Nanase sisters. They would share S≈çichir≈ç‚Äôs time, affections, and, more subtly, his protection, with Miyuki. There was an unspoken understanding, a bond formed not just of affection but of a shared desire to keep him close. ‚ÄúOnƒ´-sama, I‚Äôve been looking forward to our time together,‚Äù Miyuki said, her tone bright despite the curious glances they attracted. S≈çichir≈ç, for his part, was acutely aware of the eyes on them‚Äîthe whispers that bubbled up like a hidden spring, curiosity piqued by Miyuki‚Äôs unabashed use of 'Onƒ´-sama', a term so endearingly formal and yet intimately close. Katsuki‚Äôs agents, for it was no secret that Bakug≈ç Katsuki had eyes and ears among the student body, shadowed them at a discreet distance, their purpose as opaque as their allegiance. The date was a simple affair, chosen with the intent to enjoy each other's company away from the prying eyes and whispered speculations. They meandered through the technologically vibrant streets of the city, where the line between reality and digital fantasy blurred. It was an escape, a breath of fresh air in the stifling confines of roles and expectations. As they paused to admire a holographic display, Miyuki turned to S≈çichir≈ç, a question lingering in her gaze. ‚ÄúOnƒ´-sama, you move with such‚Ä¶ precision. Like a soldier of shadows,‚Äù she ventured, her voice low. ‚ÄúAre you a soldier of some sort?‚Äù The question, innocent as it might seem, struck a chord within S≈çichir≈ç, a reminder of the worlds he straddled‚Äîthe schism between his past and present self. The weight of it seemed to bear down on him, a tidal wave threatening to engulf him in its revealing wake. For a moment, he felt lightheaded, the cityscape around him blurring into indistinct shapes and colors. Miyuki‚Äôs reaction was not one of surprise or fear but of a gentle understanding, her smile soft and knowing. ‚ÄúI thought as much,‚Äù she chuckled, her words a balm to the tumult within him. ‚ÄúBut it doesn‚Äôt bother me, Onƒ´-sama. I‚Äôm just happy‚Ä¶ to finally meet the real you.‚Äù Her smile was like a lighthouse in the fog, guiding him back to solid ground. The revelation, instead of driving a wedge between them, seemed to have bridged a gap he hadn‚Äôt realized was there. ‚ÄúMiyuki,‚Äù S≈çichir≈ç began, the words coming slowly, carefully. ‚ÄúThere are parts of me, of my past, that are‚Ä¶ complicated. Dangerous even. I wanted to keep you safe from that.‚Äù Miyuki‚Äôs hand found his, a lifeline amidst the swirling undercurrents of his confession. ‚ÄúI know, Onƒ´-sama. And I understand why you would want to keep it hidden. But know this‚ÄîI chose to be here, with you, not because I thought it would be safe but because I know it‚Äôs where I belong.‚Äù The words settled in S≈çichir≈ç‚Äôs heart, a weight lifted. The shadows that had clung to him, the specter of his past roles and identities, seemed less daunting with Miyuki by his side. The path ahead was not guaranteed to be free of obstacles, but for the first time, S≈çichir≈ç allowed himself to believe that perhaps it didn‚Äôt have to be traversed in solitude. As they continued their walk, the agents of Katsuki still lurking in the background seemed less like a threat and more like a distant concern. For now, the world around them faded into the background, leaving only the connection they shared‚Äîa bond forged in the crucible of secrets unveiled and accepted. In this moment, Miyuki and S≈çichir≈ç were not just characters in a play of political machinations and covert operations.

Dark-purple hair framing her face and a set of headphones perpetually around her neck, she was the embodiment of a pop idol in the making, her demeanor a blend of untouchable cool and an aloof charisma that drew eyes like moths to a flame. Michika, or Ky≈çka as she was known within the academy's walls, maneuvered her way through the throngs of students with a purposeful stride. Her Quirk, a unique ability to manipulate sound, set her apart, weaving a complex melody of intrigue and curiosity around her. It wasn't long before she found herself within S≈çichir≈ç‚Äôs orbit, her demeanor flipping to one of teasing familiarity, much to the chagrin of Katsuki and his ilk. \\"S≈çichir≈ç-san, keeping company with the stars now, are we?\\" Ky≈çka quipped, seamlessly inserting herself into his day with a playful nudge. Her arrival did not go unnoticed, drawing the ire of those who viewed S≈çichir≈ç's growing harem with a blend of envy and animosity. Among the spectators was Su≈ç Amane, her fiery red hair a stark contrast against the sea of students. Amane's enigmatic presence at First Academy was shrouded in whispers of nobility and tales of a rebellious spirit. Her keen intellect and eccentric nature, coupled with an inherited Quirk that allowed her to enhance her vision to extraordinary levels, made her a formidable force. Her interest in S≈çichir≈ç, however, was driven by more than mere curiosity. Recognizing him as Kazuki's cherished sibling, she saw in him a reflection of the stories she had cherished, tales of a brother lost and then found under the most extraordinary circumstances. Amane watched, a plan forming amidst the whirlwind of emotions and memories, her desire to be part of S≈çichir≈ç's unique circle growing stronger. Her approach was as bold as it was unexpected. \\"Ky≈çka-chan, monopolizing our dear S≈çichir≈ç, are we?\\" Amane teased, slinging an arm around Michika‚Äôs shoulders with feigned indignance. \\"You'll have to share, you know. There's plenty of S≈çichir≈ç to go around, and I intend to have my piece.\\" The encounter drew a range of reactions from the surrounding students, from shocked whispers to stifled laughter, as Amane's playful claim hung in the air, a challenge wrapped in jest. S≈çichir≈ç, caught between amusement and exasperation, managed a diplomatic smile. \\"Amane-san, I wasn't aware I was a prize to be divided. I'm flattered by the attention, though I fear my schedule might not accommodate everyone's... aspirations,\\" he joked, his words a subtle attempt to navigate the complex social waters he found himself in. Ky≈çka, ever the provocateur, leaned in closer, her voice a melodic whisper only S≈çichir≈ç could hear. \\"Don't worry, S≈çichir≈ç-san. I'll make sure you have time for all of us. After all, what's a pop idol without her supportive backup?\\" Amane laughed, the sound as carefree as the wind. \\"Well said, Ky≈çka-chan. Well said. S≈çichir≈ç-kun, consider this your official invitation to a life less ordinary. With us by your side, who knows what adventures lie ahead?\\" As the trio navigated the complexities of their intertwined lives, the air around them seemed to hum with the promise of unseen challenges and unexplored connections. For S≈çichir≈ç, each day at First Academy was becoming a lesson in balancing the expectations of those around him with the ghosts of his past. Yet, amidst the laughter and light-hearted banter, a deeper narrative unfolded‚Äîone of loyalty, friendship, and the unwavering bonds of an unorthodox family. As Michika, Amane, and the others vied for his attention, S≈çichir≈ç found himself caught in a melody of his own making, a tune that promised to resonate with the echoes of his shared destiny with those who had chosen to stand by him, regardless of the dangers that lay ahead."},{"prompt":"Please write a lighthearted boarding school sports story in the style of classic school stories. Third year Janet recently left Northridge school to attend St Hilda's. At Northridge the girls used to play hockey, but at St Hilda's they play rugby instead. Janet and her friend Sally, who is still at Northridge but is visiting Janet, are watching a senior girls rugby match between St Hilda's and a rival school. It is muddy but no one cares. The St Hilda's girls love being at a school where they get to play rough and get muddy.","completion":"Janet stood on the sidelines, her eyes wide with excitement as she absorbed the spirited chaos before her. Sally, her cherished friend from Northridge, stood beside her, equally engrossed in the spectacle. Today was Janet's first encounter with the fierce and muddy world of rugby at St Hilda's, and what a delightful contrast it was to the well-manicured hockey pitches they were accustomed to. \\"Look at them go!\\" Janet exclaimed, pointing towards a cluster of St Hilda's seniors charging with unwavering determination through the mucky field. Their jerseys, once a vibrant blue and gold, were now adorned with splatters of earth, badges of honor in this rough-and-tumble sport. Sally, though initially skeptical about the appeal of such a muddy mess, couldn't hide her amusement. \\"I never thought I'd see the day when getting muddier meant you were playing better,\\" she chuckled, her eyes twinkling with mirth. Amidst the roaring and cheering of the students around them, the girls watched as St Hilda's fought valiantly against their rivals. Each tackle and scrum was met with a chorus of encouragement from the students, a testament to the school‚Äôs spirit and camaraderie. At a particularly intense moment of the game, when the scores were neck and neck, Janet gripped Sally's arm in anticipation. \\"Do you think they can do it? Can they win?\\" Janet's voice was laced with hope. Sally, ever the optimist, beamed. \\"Of course! St Hilda's girls are unstoppable, especially when they're this muddy!\\" Their laughter mingled with the cheers around them, creating a bubble of joy amidst the competitive fervor. Just then, St Hilda‚Äôs star player, Sophie, broke through the rival defense, the rugby ball clutched securely in her arms. With a final burst of energy, she dived over the try line, securing victory for St Hilda's. The crowd erupted into ecstatic cheers, none louder than Janet and Sally, who hugged each other in jubilant celebration. As the players emerged from the field, more resembling mud sculptures than schoolgirls, Janet felt a surge of pride for her new school. Later, as they shared hot cocoa in the school's common room, Janet and Sally reminisced about the day's adventures. \\"You know, Sally, I think I'm going to like it here at St Hilda's. The mud, the rugby, the spirited camaraderie ‚Äì it's all so exhilarating!\\" Janet said, her eyes sparkling with newfound passion. Sally nodded, her voice warm with affection. \\"And I‚Äôll always have a reason to visit, especially to watch you become a rugby star. Just promise me one thing, though?\\" \\"Anything,\\" Janet replied, eager. \\"Try not to bring too much of the field back with you. I'm not sure the common room is ready for a mud invasion!\\" Their laughter filled the room, a perfect end to an unforgettable day. Janet knew that her transition from Northridge to St Hilda's would be filled with challenges, but with rugby and Sally by her side, she was ready for anything."},{"prompt":"Please vividly describe Sophie's dive to score a try. Show how she was already dirty but got even dirtier. Mud splashes up all over her face as she lands in the sloppy mud. Describe her appearance in detail.","completion":"Sophie, with the rugby ball clutched tightly against her chest, eyed the try line with a fierce determination. Her uniform, once a proud showcase of St Hilda's blue and gold, was now almost unrecognizable, cloaked in layers of earthy browns and murky greens from the game's earlier scuffles. Trickles of mud had found their way into every crevice of her kit, from her socks, heavy with the weight of the wet ground, to the once-white shorts now indistinguishable from the terrain they had been playing on. Her hair, tied back at the start of the match, had long since surrendered to the chaos of the game, with strands plastered to her cheeks and forehead, forming dark, muddy streaks against her skin. Despite the grime, her eyes sparkled with an unyielding spirit, reflecting the resolve and tenacity that defined her as St Hilda‚Äôs star player. As she darted forward, sidestepping a rival with practiced ease, the endgame was clear in her mind. The muddy field squelched under her boots with every sprinting step, threatening to claim her as its own with every moment of traction lost and regained. Yet, Sophie pressed on, propelled by the roaring cheers of her teammates and spectators alike. Moments away from the try line, with the goal within heart-stopping reach, she launched herself into the air in a daredevil dive, the ball still shielded securely against her. As she collided with the ground, a spectacular explosion of mud erupted around her. The sloppy earth, loosened by the day's relentless play, splashed upwards, showering her face and sealing her transformation into a true warrior of the game. Sophie's landing was a masterpiece of determination meeting the unforgiving, mucky battlefield. The momentum carried her sliding forward, her face smeared with fresh layers of mud that coated her features, leaving only the whites of her eyes stark against the earthy mask that now covered her. Mud splattered across her cheeks, mingled with the remnants of the battle already present. Her once discernible uniform and skin were now painted with the undeniable signature of a player who had given her all on the field. As she lay there for a moment, the ball safely grounded beyond the try line, Sophie's triumphant smile was barely visible beneath the mud-caked veneer. She was dirtier than she had ever been, completely drenched in the tangible evidence of her relentless pursuit of victory. Yet, in that moment, as the cheers erupted around her and her teammates rushed to celebrate, Sophie had never shone brighter, her spirit and determination crystallizing into the pure, indomitable essence of a rugby champion at St Hilda‚Äôs."},{"prompt":"–¢–æ–ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è —Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º–∞ —à—Ç–∞—Ç–∞ –õ—É–∏–∑–∏–∞–Ω–∞","completion":"–¢–æ–ø–æ–Ω–∏–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∞—è —Å–∏—Å—Ç–µ–º–∞ —à—Ç–∞—Ç–∞

(colorectal cancer) can be non-specific, especially in the early stages, which makes it challenging to diagnose based on symptoms alone. Some individuals might not even experience any symptoms until the cancer has progressed. Here are some of the non-specific, rare, or less obvious manifestations of colorectal cancer: 1. **Changes in Bowel Habits**: Subtle changes in bowel habits that don't necessarily suggest cancer to many people, including constipation, diarrhea, narrowing of stool, or a feeling that the bowel does not empty completely. 2. **Abdominal Discomfort**: Vague, intermittent abdominal discomfort, such as cramps, gas, or pain, might be brushed off as digestive issues or other benign conditions. 3. **Fatigue and Weakness**: These can be signs of many different conditions, not specifically pointing to cancer. In colorectal cancer, fatigue might be related to a subtle loss of blood in the stool leading to anemia. 4. **Weight Loss**: Unintended weight loss without changing diet or exercise habits can be a sign of colorectal cancer but is also associated with a wide variety of other health conditions. 5. **Bloating or Fullness**: Feeling bloated or a sense of abdominal fullness can be very non-specific and is common to many digestive issues. 6. **Vague Abdominal or Back Pain**: Pain is a very non-specific symptom and can be related to numerous conditions, making this a particularly insidious manifestation when it relates to colorectal cancer. 7. **Iron-Deficiency Anemia**: Particularly in men and postmenopausal women, iron-deficiency anemia could be the only sign of an underlying colorectal cancer, especially if it is located in the proximal (right-sided) colon where bleeding might be less noticeable. 8. **Non-visible (Occult) Blood in Stool**: Sometimes, the bleeding from colorectal cancer is only detectable through a fecal occult blood test, making it a rare and non-descript manifestation. 9. **Bowel Obstruction Symptoms**: In rare cases, the first symptom might be signs of a bowel obstruction, such as severe constipation, abdominal pain, vomiting, and abdominal distension, but these are more likely in advanced stages. 10. **Unexplained Changes in Appetite**: A general decline in interest in food or feeling full quicker than usual without an obvious reason. While some of these manifestations might occur in a wide range of conditions, not just colorectal cancer, their presence, especially in combination or persisting over time, should prompt a thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional. Early detection through screening remains a key element in successfully treating colorectal cancer."},{"prompt":"√©cris un po√®me sur l'amour des abeilles en France √† Paris","completion":"Dans les rues de Paris, les abeilles butinent, Leur amour pour les fleurs est infini.

Proporciona una visi√≥n clara de cu√°ndo deben empezar y terminar las distintas actividades, permitiendo as√≠ una gesti√≥n del tiempo m√°s eficiente. En esencia, un cronograma ayuda a monitorear el progreso de las tareas y asegurar que el proyecto se mantenga en curso. Aqu√≠ tienes tres ejemplos de situaciones en las cuales se utiliza un cronograma: 1. **Proyecto de Construcci√≥n**: En un proyecto de construcci√≥n, un cronograma es crucial para coordinar las diferentes fases del proyecto, desde la preparaci√≥n del terreno, cimentaci√≥n, estructura, instalaciones hasta los acabados finales. Adem√°s, ayuda a organizar el trabajo de los diferentes equipos, como arquitectos, ingenieros, obreros, y proveedores de materiales, asegur√°ndose de que todos los componentes del proyecto se completen en el orden correcto y a tiempo. 2. **Planificaci√≥n de Eventos**: Para la organizaci√≥n de un evento grande, como una conferencia, concierto, o boda, se utiliza un cronograma para detallar todas las tareas necesarias para llevar a cabo el evento. Esto puede incluir la reserva del lugar, contrataci√≥n de proveedores, promoci√≥n del evento, registro de participantes, configuraci√≥n del espacio, entre otros. Un cronograma efectivo asegura que cada componente est√© listo para el d√≠a del evento. 3. **Desarrollo de Software**: En un proyecto de desarrollo de software, un cronograma es esencial para planificar las distintas etapas del proceso de desarrollo, como la conceptualizaci√≥n, dise√±o, codificaci√≥n, pruebas y despliegue del software. Tambi√©n facilita la coordinaci√≥n entre los equipos de desarrolladores, dise√±adores, y testers, adem√°s de ayudar a gestionar las expectativas de los stakeholders sobre los plazos de entrega del producto final. El uso de cronogramas no solo se limita a estos ejemplos, sino que se extiende a casi cualquier tipo de proyecto o actividad que requiera una gesti√≥n organizada del tiempo y los recursos."},{"prompt":"Write a story about a female, cyan blob","completion":"Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there lived a curious creature known as a cyan blob. This particular blob was unique in that she was female, a rarity among her kind. She had a shimmering, aquamarine tint to her translucent form, and her movements were graceful and fluid, like a dancer gliding through the water. The cyan blob lived in a peaceful pond at the edge of a lush forest, where she spent her days exploring her watery home and interacting with the other creatures that lived there. She was a gentle and inquisitive being, always eager to learn more about the world around her. One day, as she was swimming lazily along the surface of the pond, she noticed a group of tiny fish darting about in a panic. Curious, she approached them to see what was wrong. The fish explained that a fierce predator, a giant serpent with gleaming scales and razor-sharp teeth, had been terrorizing them for days, and they didn't know what to do. The cyan blob felt a surge of empathy for the frightened fish and immediately sprang into action. She swirled around them protectively, using her gooey body to shield them from harm. When the serpent appeared, she bravely confronted it, weaving intricate patterns in the water to confuse and distract the predator. The serpent, taken aback by the cyan blob's boldness and ingenuity, quickly retreated, vanishing into the depths of the pond. The fish cheered and thanked their savior, marveling at her bravery and resourcefulness. From that day on, the cyan blob became a revered guardian of the pond, respected by all who lived there. But despite her newfound fame and accolades, the cyan blob remained humble and kind, never seeking recognition or reward for her deeds. She continued to explore the world around her, always eager to learn and grow, a shining example of courage and compassion in a world full of darkness and danger. And so, the story of the female cyan blob spread far and wide, becoming a legend of kindness and bravery that would be told and retold for generations to come. And though she may have been just a tiny speck in the vastness of the universe, the cyan blob left an indelible mark on the hearts of all who encountered her, a beacon of light and hope in a world that sorely needed it."},{"prompt":"Write about her appearance","completion":"The female cyan blob was a stunning sight to behold.

Her movements were elegant and precise, each twist and turn a mesmerizing display of beauty and grace. Despite her ethereal appearance, the cyan blob exuded a sense of strength and resilience that belied her delicate exterior. There was a quiet confidence in the way she moved, a silent determination that spoke volumes about her character. She carried herself with poise and grace, a regal presence in the tranquil pond where she made her home. Those who beheld her were captivated by her beauty and struck by the air of mystery that surrounded her.

Within the series, Makima stands out as a highly complex and enigmatic figure, who initially presents herself as an ally to the protagonist, Denji. She works for the Public Safety Devil Hunters, a government organization dedicated to combating devils that pose a threat to humanity. Makima holds a significant rank within this organization, showcasing her strength, intelligence, and strategic acumen. Her character is wrapped in mystery for a significant portion of the series, which slowly unravels to reveal a multitude of layers to her personality, motivations, and true nature. Without delving into major spoilers, it becomes apparent that Makima possesses her own agenda and a profound understanding of both devil and human worlds. Her interactions with Denji are particularly pivotal, influencing his development and the series' overarching narrative in profound ways. Makima is characterized by her calm demeanor, manipulative tendencies, and a detached sense of morality, which makes her one of the series' most intriguing and controversial characters. Her true identity, goals, and the extent of her powers are major elements of the story, contributing to \\"Chainsaw Man's\\" themes of desire, control, and the nature of humanity versus that of devils. The complexity of her character, combined with her impact on the story and other characters, makes Makima a standout character in the series and a subject of much discussion and analysis among fans."},{"prompt":"Make a first-person point of view of an unnamed nobleman from during Tokugawa Japan......regarding Makima....but through the views of a man who has no idea who she is...but she sends chills in him....why?..","completion":"In the stillness of my study, lit only by the gentle flicker of lantern light, my thoughts find themselves ensnared by the visage of a woman, the likes of which the scrolls of our ancestors could scarcely have imagined. She is not of this time, not of the Tokugawa Japan that I, a nobleman of considerable esteem, have been born into. Yet, her image haunts the very edges of my consciousness, sending a chill deep into the marrow of my bones. Her stride, confident and unwavering, speaks of power and authority, the kind that men such as I command and yet, somehow, beyond it. Her gaze, piercing and unyielding, betrays knowledge of worlds and depths unfathomable to the mortal mind. Who is she? A deity, draped in the guise of a mortal woman, or perhaps a demoness, come to test the resolve of men? My education, extensive and diverse, provides no answers, leaving me with a sense of unease that clings like the morning fog over the rice fields. Her manner is serene, calm as the surface of the lake in the heart of winter, yet I sense a tumult, a roaring tempest, veiled behind those eyes that seem to see through the facades of men. How is it that someone, whose name escapes me, whose origin remains shrouded in mystery, can invoke such a stir within the depths of my being? It is as if she wields the power to unravel the very threads that compose the fabric of our society, with mere words, with but a glance. Is it fear that this unknown woman instills in me? Or is it something far more unsettling‚Äîa recognition, perhaps, of the fragility of our constructs, the delicate balance upon which our realm rests, suddenly made all too apparent by her presence? She is an enigma, defying the strictures and roles that bind the rest of us, moving through our world with an ease that belies an understanding, or perhaps an indifference, to the intricate dance of power and diplomacy that occupies the days of a nobleman such as myself. The night grows deeper, and the cool air whispers through the cracks in the shoji, yet I find no solace in the encroaching darkness. For within it, I see her silhouette, an indelible mark upon the canvas of my mind. I cannot escape the feeling that her existence, wherever she may hail from, challenges the very foundation of what I have known. Makima, a name that feels as much a key to a forbidden mystery as it does a herald of change, an unbidden gust that threatens to unsettle the calm waters of my soul. Why does she send chills in me, this woman who stands outside the realm of my understanding, outside the carefully maintained order of our society? It is a question that lingers, unanswered, as the first light of dawn seeks to reclaim the skies from the night. In the quiet of my chambers, amidst the tangible relics of tradition and power, I am left unsettled, pondering the enigma of her being, the quiet disquiet she has sown in the depths of my heart."},{"prompt":"–ø–µ—Ä–µ—Ñ—Ä–∞–∑–∏—Ä—É–π If looking for an effortless style that also accentuates your best facial features, soft curtain bangs are what you might need!","completion":"If you're in search of a style that's easy to maintain and highlights your best facial characteristics, soft curtain bangs could be exactly what you need!"},{"prompt":"Write a news article where Sauchiehall Street in Glasgow begins to crack down on empty shops","completion":"Glasgow's Sauchiehall Street Sees New Initiative to Tackle Vacant Shops **Glasgow, Scotland** - Sauchiehall Street, once a bustling hub of retail activity in the heart of Glasgow, is implementing a bold strategy to combat the growing challenge of empty shopfronts. In a collaborative effort between Glasgow City Council and local business leaders, the initiative seeks to revitalize the iconic street by attracting new businesses and offering innovative solutions to fill the increasing number of vacant shops. For decades, Sauchiehall Street has been celebrated for its diverse range of shops, restaurants, and entertainment venues. However, like many high streets across the UK, it has faced significant pressures in recent years, including the rise of online shopping and the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. These factors have contributed to a noticeable increase in empty retail spaces, prompting concerns about the street's future vitality. The new programme, announced this Monday, focuses on several key areas to address the issue. One of the main strategies involves offering financial incentives to entrepreneurs and established businesses willing to occupy and rejuvenate these empty spaces. These incentives include reduced rent periods and grants for refurbishments, aimed at lowering the barriers for new and expanding businesses to set up shop on Sauchiehall Street. Furthermore, the initiative seeks to diversify the types of businesses along the street, moving beyond traditional retail to include more cultural, recreational, and community-focused venues. This approach aims to draw a wider range of visitors and breathe new life into the area. \\"Cities change, and it's imperative that we adapt to ensure vibrant and viable urban centers,\\" stated Councillor Susan Aitken, Leader of Glasgow City Council. \\"Sauchiehall Street has a rich history and a bright future ahead. By tackling the issue of empty shops head-on, we're not just solving a problem; we're opening a world of possibilities for innovation, culture, and community.\\" The initiative also includes efforts to enhance the overall environment of Sauchiehall Street. Plans are in place to improve pedestrian areas, increase green spaces, and support public art projects. These enhancements are seen as crucial steps in creating a more attractive and welcoming atmosphere for both shoppers and businesses. Local business owners and entrepreneurs have expressed optimism about the initiative. \\"It's an exciting time to be a part of Sauchiehall Street's transformation,\\" said Jamie Robertson, a prospective business owner looking to open a new caf√©. \\"The support and vision for the future give us confidence that this is the right place to invest our efforts and passion.\\" As the initiative gains momentum, Glasgow City Council and its partners are confident that these actions will not only fill the vacant shopfronts but also re-establish Sauchiehall Street as a dynamic destination for shopping, entertainment, and community connection. Efforts are already underway to identify potential tenants for the empty spaces, with several pop-up shops and experimental business models slated to debut in the coming months. Through these innovative approaches, Sauchiehall Street is set to reclaim its status as a thriving center of urban life in Glasgow."},{"prompt":"ÿßÿ±ŸäÿØ ŸÉÿ™ÿßÿ®ÿ© ÿßÿ®Ÿäÿßÿ™ ÿ¥ÿπÿ± ŸÖÿ§ÿ´ÿ±Ÿá

Japan, set in the year 1775...‚Ä¶regarding Makima‚Ä¶but through the views of a man who has no idea who she is‚Ä¶but she sends chills in him‚Ä¶why?....","completion":"As I pen these words, a curious and unnerving encounter has left me with a feeling I cannot seem to shake off. It was an ordinary afternoon in the year of 1775, under the rule of our esteemed Tokugawa shogunate, when my path crossed with that of an enigmatic woman. Her presence, unlike any other, sends chills down my spine, disturbing the tranquility that I, a nobleman, am accustomed to. I was returning from a leisurely stroll in the garden, pondering upon the matters of state and our clan's fortunes, when a figure caught my eye. She stood amidst the bustling marketplace, seemingly out of place yet perfectly at ease, her gaze intense and searching. It was as though she was looking through the very souls of those around her, seeing what no ordinary being could. Her appearance was that of nobility, yet there was an air about her that I could not quite decipher. Our eyes met, and in that moment, a chill coursed through my veins. It was as if she saw through my prestigious facade, into the depths of my very essence. Who was this woman, and whence had she come? Her name, her purpose, remained shrouded in mystery. All that lingered in the air was the name \\"Makima\\", whispered amongst the townsfolk as she passed. I could not ascertain why her presence unnerved me so. Was it her discerning gaze, or perhaps, the aura of power that seemed to envelop her? In my many years as a nobleman serving under the Tokugawa shogunate, I have encountered many a person of strength and authority. Yet, none have made the hairs on the back of my neck stand, nor my heart race with inexplicable apprehension, as she did. In the days that followed, I found myself increasingly intrigued by this mysterious Makima. My inquiries amongst the townsfolk and other nobles yielded naught but vague rumors and hearsay. Some spoke of her as if she were a benevolent protector, whilst others whispered of manipulation and control that knew no bounds. It was as if she was both everywhere and nowhere, a specter haunting my thoughts. Why does she send such chills in me? Perhaps it is the fear of the unknown, or the realization that there exists a power beyond the reaches of our noble hierarchies and societal bounds. As a nobleman, I have been taught to believe in the order of things, in the stability that our rule provides. Yet, in her silent challenge, in that single, unnerving gaze, I see a world turned askew, questioning all that I have known. I sit here now, under the shadow of uncertainty, pondering the implications of her existence. Makima, a name that now haunts my waking thoughts and my dreams alike, represents a mystery that I find myself compelled, yet fearful, to unravel. What secrets does she hold, and what does her presence foretell for us under the rule of the Tokugawa shogunate? Only time, it seems, shall reveal the truth behind the chills she sends down my spine."},{"prompt":"Please write a lighthearted boarding school sports story in the style of classic school stories.

At Northridge the girls used to play hockey, but at St Hilda's they play rugby instead.

Sally, who had come over from Northridge for a visit, was visibly taken aback by the gusto with which the girls threw themselves into the game. Janet, on the other hand, was already getting into the spirit of things at her new school, her eyes sparkling with excitement as the senior girls of St Hilda's, donned in their green shirts and black shorts, clashed with their rivals in a game of rugby. \\"It's totally different from hockey, isn't it?\\" Janet said, nudging Sally, who was still trying to wrap her head around the rules of the game. \\"Absolutely,\\" Sally laughed, \\"But look at them, they're having the time of their lives out there!\\" The game was well underway, and the pitch had quickly transformed into a muddy battlefield. The senior girls of St Hilda‚Äôs, undeterred by the slippery conditions, charged ahead with determination. Muddy streaks adorned their arms and legs, a testament to their fearless tackles and dives for the ball. Their knees were caked in mud, especially those of the scrum half, who seemed to have a magnet for the muckiest parts of the field. One player, a winger, had mud splattered up to her elbows, a clear sign she'd made a spectacular dive to save the ball from going out. Her green shirt, now a patchwork of grass, mud, and determination, stuck to her like a second skin as she sprinted down the line, dodging tackles. The forwards were in the thick of it, their faces streaked with sweat and mud, making them look like warriors of old. During scrums, their arms and legs became entangled in a mess of limbs and mud, each push sending fresh splatters across their shorts and socks. One of the props had mud smeared across her cheek, the result of a particularly aggressive tackle that sent her and her opponent sliding across the pitch. In the midst of the chaos, a particularly tense moment arose when St Hilda‚Äôs was awarded a penalty kick. The entire field fell into a hushed anticipation. The kicker, a tall girl whose socks were now more brown than green, steadied herself. With a powerful run-up, she sent the ball through the posts, earning her team crucial points. Her hands, previously gripping the muddy ball, were a testament to her pivotal role, smeared with the earthy evidence of the hard-fought match. As the game neared its end, the intensity on the field didn't wane. A dramatic try in the last minutes by St Hilda's sealed their victory. The girl who scored the final try was a sight to behold; her black shorts almost completely brown with mud and her green shirt clinging limply to her frame. She raised her mud-caked arms in triumph, a grin splitting her mud-splattered face. Afterwards, the girls on the sidelines and the field erupted into cheers and laughter, their camaraderie evident even from a distance. Janet turned to Sally, both of them unable to resist the infectious joy of the moment. \\"See? It's not just about playing rough and getting dirty. It's about having fun, teamwork, and giving it your all,\\" Janet said, her eyes following the muddy, jubilant figures as they congratulated each other. Sally nodded, a wide grin spreading across her face. \\"I can see that now. Rugby at St Hilda's is something else.\\" And as the girls watched the St Hilda‚Äôs team celebrate their muddy victory, it was clear that the game was more than just a match; it was a celebration of spirit, resilience, and the sheer joy of playing sports, no matter how dirty one got in the process."},{"prompt":"What was the name of the girl who scored the final try? Vividly describe her scoring the try. Did she have dirty hands? Arms? Knees? Thighs? Bum? Did she try to avoid getting dirtier by diving into a relatively dry part of the try line?","completion":"The girl who scored the final try for St Hilda‚Äôs was none other than their swift and nimble left wing, Ellie. As the game clock dwindled down to the final minutes, the atmosphere on the pitch was electric, every player and spectator on edge. Ellie, who had been a blur of motion throughout the match, found herself in possession of the ball just when it mattered most. Her run to the try line was like a masterclass in agility and determination. Swerving past one defender, then sidestepping another, Ellie was a vision of focus, her eyes locked on the prize. By now, the mud had claimed much of her; her arms were streaked with dirt, evidence of her earlier tussles and dives for the ball. Her knees and thighs bore the brunt of the game‚Äôs physicality, caked in mud from sliding attempts at tackles and the occasional trip and fall. Even her bum didn‚Äôt escape unscathed, marked by a particularly enthusiastic slide into a muddy patch earlier in the half. Her hands, which had gripped, passed, and maneuvered the muddy ball all game, were anything but clean, coated in a layer of grime that made the ball almost a natural extension of her arm. As Ellie neared the try line, it became apparent she was making a beeline for a spot that seemed marginally less muddy than the rest, a strategic choice that perhaps spoke to a fleeting desire to avoid getting even dirtier. But in the heat of the moment, with the try line just a dive away, all thoughts of staying clean vanished. With a burst of speed and a final lunge, Ellie dove for the try line, sliding into the slightly drier patch with the ball securely pressed to her chest. The impact sent a fresh spray of mud up her front, leaving her face flecked with droplets of muck. Yet, the moment was nothing short of triumphant. As Ellie lay there for a moment, the cheers of her teammates and the spectators washing over her, she was the embodiment of pure elation mixed with the gritty reality of the game‚Äîmud-splattered, breathless, and victorious. Getting up, Ellie‚Äôs grin was unstoppable, her muddy figure a testament to her effort and the hard-fought victory she secured for St Hilda‚Äôs. Her joy was infectious, drawing her teammates into a jubilant group hug, not minding in the slightest that they were all sharing the mud and grime of their collective triumph."},{"prompt":"please describe a conversion attempt. how do the muddy conditions affect the girl taking the kick? does her own muddiness, the muddiness of the ground or the dirty ball make a difference? does she have muddy legs, shorts, arms, etc?","completion":"Right after Ellie's spectacular try that had everyone on the edge of their seats, it was time for the conversion attempt‚Äîan additional chance for St Hilda's to add two more points to their tally. The responsibility fell on the shoulders of their kicker, Mia, known among her teammates for her accuracy and calm under pressure. As Mia prepared for the kick, the condition of the pitch and the equipment was far from ideal. The persistent drizzle throughout the game had turned the ground into a slippery mess, with patches of mud more treacherous than others. Preparing for her kick, Mia eyed the spot where the ball lay, her focus intense. Her once black shorts were now smeared with mud, predominantly on the back from where she'd sat to tie her laces earlier, inadvertently choosing a particularly muddy spot. Her legs bore the marks of the game; streaks of mud reached up to her thighs, a testament to her active role in the game's plays and tackles. Her arms, too, were not spared, decorated with splatters and smudges, especially around her elbows from supporting her falls. Approaching the ball, Mia‚Äôs boots squelched in the mud, making it clear that stability would be an issue. The soft ground underfoot squirmed slightly as she placed her non-kicking foot beside the ball, finding the least muddy area she could manage within her range. Her eyes took a moment to study the ball itself, which was no longer the bright white it had been at the start but rather a dull brown, coated in a film of mud that made its texture unpredictable. Taking a deep breath, Mia attempted to brush some of the mud off her hands against her shorts, an effort that served more to calm her nerves than to actually clean them. With muddy hands gripping the equally dirty ball, ensuring a stable placement was more challenging than under clean conditions. The ball, slippery and unpredictable, demanded a delicate touch. Mia took a few steps back, her concentration palpable. She made a mental note of the wind's direction, a slight breeze that was thankfully in her favor. With a short run-up, she kicked. The muddy conditions affected her balance slightly, a minor slip that caused her heart to skip, but her technique was solid. The ball spun awkwardly through the air, its journey more a testament to Mia's skill than the air's cooperation, given its muddy coating which altered its flight. The ball sailed towards the posts, its path slightly wobbly. Everyone held their breath as it barely cleared the crossbar, a successful conversion under less-than-ideal conditions. Cheers erupted from the St Hilda's side, admiration clear for Mia's ability to navigate the challenges presented by the mud‚Äîon the ground, on the ball, and on herself. Mia's smile as she jogged back to her teammates was one of relief and pride. Her muddy appearance, from her legs to her hands, was a badge of honor in that moment, evidence of her perseverance and skill amidst the challenges. The muddy conditions had indeed made a difference, but through technique, focus, and a bit of grit, Mia had risen to the occasion."},{"prompt":"please write more. janet is having a games lesson and is praticing some rugby skills with her formmates. she is slow to get back to her feet at one point and the games mistress jokingly tells her not to lie there enjoying her mud bath but to get up and keep playing.","completion":"Janet was thoroughly enjoying her games lesson, which today was entirely devoted to rugby skills. The recent rains had made the pitch even muddier than usual, turning the session into a slippery, joyous mess. Janet, who had quickly grown to love the rough-and-tumble nature of rugby since transferring to St Hilda‚Äôs, was fully committed, throwing herself into every tackle and ruck with gusto. During a drill focusing on ball-handling under pressure, Janet found herself at the bottom of a ruck, the ball securely in her grasp but her body pinned by the weight of her enthusiastic formmates. When the tangle of limbs finally dispersed, and her teammates scrambled to their feet, Janet took a moment longer, her back plastered with mud, feeling the cool squelch of the earth beneath her. It was in this moment, lying there with the sky a pale wash overhead, that she couldn‚Äôt help but grin, feeling an odd sense of tranquility amidst the chaos of the game. ‚ÄúJanet, this isn‚Äôt a spa day! No time for enjoying your mud bath. Up you get!‚Äù The games mistress‚Äôs voice, tinged with amusement, jolted Janet back to the present. Laughing, Janet pushed herself up, the effort sending more mud splattering against her sides. She was a sight to behold; her kit was now a uniform smear of brown, making her almost indistinguishable from the field itself. Her arms and legs were caked, and even her face had not escaped unscathed‚Äîa splodge of mud adorned her cheek courtesy of an earlier dive for the ball. With a mixture of sheepishness and mirth, Janet re-joined the drill, her formmates chuckling along with her. They had all been there at one point or another, finding unexpected delight in the game's messier aspects. As they passed the ball among themselves, focusing on keeping it secure even when tackled, Janet felt a surge of joy. The physicality, the teamwork, and yes, even the mud, made rugby exhilarating in a way she had never experienced with hockey at Northridge. The games lesson continued with drills that tested their agility, their ability to read the play, and their passing accuracy, all amidst the challenging muddy conditions. Each slip, slide, and fall was met with laughter and encouragement, the girls helping one another to their feet and the games mistress providing tips on how to maintain balance and control despite the slick pitch. As the session drew to a close, Janet and her formmates jogged slowly back towards the changing rooms, their feet heavy with mud but their spirits light. The muddy adventures on the rugby field were quickly becoming one of Janet‚Äôs favorite aspects of life at St Hilda's. It was more than just learning a new sport; it was about camaraderie, resilience, and finding joy in every splash and tumble. ‚ÄúGood work today, girls!‚Äù the games mistress called out as they neared the buildings, her tone one of approval. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really becoming quite the rugby enthusiasts!‚Äù Janet couldn‚Äôt help but agree wholeheartedly, already looking forward to the next challenge, the next game, and, of course, the next glorious dive into the mud."},{"prompt":"Please write about sally coming back for a visit. Janet lends her a rugby kit in her sizs and the two go out together so Janet can show Sally the basics of the game - and get absolutely covered in mud. What happens? Is Sally reluctant to get dirty?","completion":"Sally's return visit to St Hilda's was met with a palpable excitement, especially from Janet, who had planned an entire afternoon outdoors. Eager to introduce her friend to the thrilling world of rugby‚Äîa sport Janet had wholeheartedly embraced at her new school‚ÄîJanet had prepared everything they'd need, including an extra rugby kit in Sally's size. \\"Here, I've got you your very own kit for today,\\" Janet said, presenting Sally with the ensemble with a flourish. Sally eyed the green shirt, black shorts, and socks with a mixture of excitement and trepidation. \\"I've never played rugby before‚Ä¶ and it looks like we'll be getting quite muddy,\\" she remarked, a hint of reluctance in her voice, already noticing the state of the grassy field gleaming with puddles and mud from recent rains. \\"Don't worry, you'll love it. And the mud? That's half the fun!\\" Janet assured her, her enthusiasm infectious. Sally, somewhat reassured but still apprehensive about getting utterly covered in mud, changed into the rugby kit. As they stepped onto the field, the soft squelch of the waterlogged ground underfoot was impossible to ignore. Janet started off with some basic drills, showing Sally how to pass the ball correctly and tackle softly on the softer ground. Initially, Sally tiptoed around the muddiest patches, eliciting a laugh from Janet. \\"Come on, Sal, you can't avoid the mud forever!\\" And as if to demonstrate, Janet scooped up the ball, made a pretend dash down the field, and executed a dramatic slide into a particularly muddy patch, splashing mud in a wide arc around her. The sight of Janet, now gloriously mud-splattered, grinning from ear to ear, was the push Sally needed. Chuckling, she allowed herself to get more into the spirit of things, her initial reluctance fading with each pass of the oval ball. Their practice escalated to a mini-game of tag rugby, focusing more on evasive maneuvers and less on physical tackles, given Sally's newcomer status. The inevitable happened soon after‚ÄîSally, attempting to evade a playful tag from Janet, slipped on the slick grass, landing with a soft thud and a spray of mud. The shock of the fall quickly gave way to laughter as she looked up at Janet, her face, arms, and kit smeared with mud. \\"See? Not so bad, is it?\\" Janet teased, extending a hand to help Sally to her feet. Sally couldn‚Äôt help but laugh, shaking her head. \\"Not bad at all, actually. Quite liberating,\\" she admitted, now fully embracing the mess. The rest of the afternoon passed in a blur of rugby and laughter, the two friends challenging each other to silly contests that invariably ended with one or both of them sliding into the mud. By the time they called it a day, Sally and Janet were thoroughly drenched in mud, virtually unrecognizable. Their faces beamed with joy, their initial clean states a distant memory. Sally, initially reluctant to embrace the muddiness, found a delightful freedom in letting go and just enjoying the moment, rugby and all. As they trudged back towards the dorms, leaving a trail of muddy footprints, Sally turned to Janet, \\"Thanks for today. I never thought I'd say this, but getting covered in mud playing rugby was actually one of the best experiences I've ever had.\\" Janet smiled, her heart warm with the success of the day. \\"Anytime, Sal. Rugby has a way of doing that to you.\\" Their laughter echoed across the field, a testament to their afternoon of muddy adventures and the power of trying something new, no matter how messy."},{"prompt":"please write a follow on story. sally goes back to northridge and tells all her classmates about the match she witnessed. how do they react? are some shocked? jealous? grateful they dont go to St Hildas? please write more. sallys school arranges that girls who want to can go to try out rugby at st hildas. janet helps teach these girls the basics of the game. in their first lesson she encourages them to embrace the mud, coming up with fun basic exercises that naturally involve lots of contact with the ground.","completion":"Upon her return to Northridge, Sally became something of a minor celebrity among her classmates. The story of her visit to St Hilda's, particularly the rugby match she witnessed and then participated in, spread like wildfire. Gathered around in their common room, Sally regaled her classmates with tales of the muddy rugby pitch, the fearless players, and the thrilling game that had converted her into a rugby enthusiast. \\"Some of them were so covered in mud, you could barely tell what team they were on!\\" Sally exclaimed, her eyes sparkling with the excitement of the memory. \\"And the way they played‚Äîso fearless and tough. It was incredible!\\" The reactions among her classmates were mixed. A few looked shocked, unable to fathom why anyone would willingly throw themselves into the mud and engage in such a physically demanding sport. \\"Mud? All over? On purpose?\\" one girl asked, her nose wrinkling at the thought. Others, however, seemed visibly intrigued, their curiosity piqued by Sally‚Äôs vivid storytelling. \\"That actually sounds... kind of fun?\\" another classmate mused, her initial skepticism giving way to a budding interest. Then there were a few who were outright jealous of Sally's adventurous foray into the rough-and-tumble world of rugby. \\"I wish we could do something like that here,\\" they lamented, the longing clear in their voices. Sally‚Äôs tales and the varied reactions did not go unnoticed by the Northridge faculty. Sensing an opportunity to broaden their students' horizons, the school arranged for a special visit to St Hilda's. Girls who were interested could sign up to try out rugby, learning the basics of the game from none other than Janet and a few of her teammates. The day of the visit arrived, and a small but enthusiastic group from Northridge, led by Sally, stood hesitantly on the edge of the same muddy rugby pitch that had played host to Sally‚Äôs transformative experience. The ground was just as muddy, if not more so, from recent rains, setting the stage for another day of messy adventures. Janet, ever the welcoming host, greeted each visitor with a wide grin. \\"Ready to get muddy?\\" she asked, a playful challenge in her tone. The Northridge girls exchanged nervous glances, the initial hesitancy palpable. Sensing their trepidation, Janet decided to start them off with something simple to break the ice‚Äîa ‚Äòmud slide‚Äô competition. The goal was straightforward: run up to a particularly muddy patch and slide as far as possible. To demonstrate, Janet took a running start and launched herself into a slide, mud splashing everywhere. Her laughter, genuine and infectious, encouraged the first few tentative volunteers to give it a try. Soon, the air was filled with the sounds of laughter and splashing as the girls took turns sliding, the initial awkwardness fading away with each muddy landing. Emboldened by the fun they were having, the group moved on to more structured rugby exercises. Janet led them through basic passing drills and tag rugby games, designed to get them comfortable with the ball and moving around the pitch‚Äîall of which naturally involved a lot of contact with the ground and, consequently, the mud. By the end of the lesson, the visiting Northridge girls were breathless, muddy, and exhilarated. The apprehension they had arrived with had been thoroughly washed away, replaced by a newfound appreciation for rugby and the shared fun of getting dirty. As they gathered their belongings, ready to head back to Northridge, the change in their demeanor was clear. They were already excitedly discussing the possibility of starting their own rugby team, inspired by the fearless play and camaraderie they‚Äôd witnessed and participated in at St Hilda's. Janet watched them go, a sense of satisfaction filling her. \\"There's nothing like a bit of mud to bring people together,\\" she thought, her heart full from the day's events."},{"prompt":"please write more. some of the northridge girls have been learning to play rugby for several months now and a match is organised between st hildas and northridge.","completion":"Several months had flown by since the Northridge girls, inspired by Sally's tales and their own muddy initiation at St Hilda's, began their foray into the world of rugby. Under the guidance of some enthusiastic teachers who had taken it upon themselves to learn the sport alongside their students, the Northridge rugby team had slowly but steadily shaped up. Practicing in all weathers, learning to embrace the physicality of the sport, and, of course, the mud, had become a regular part of their routine. The excitement was palpable when it was announced that a friendly match was organized between St Hilda's and the newly formed Northridge team. For the Northridge girls, it was a chance to test their skills in a real game scenario and show how far they had come since that first muddy training session. For St Hilda's, it was an opportunity to welcome new enthusiasts to the sport they loved and to foster a sense of camaraderie and sportsmanship beyond the walls of their own school. The day of the match arrived, greeted by a sky that couldn't seem to decide between rain and sunshine, resulting in a pitch that was a perfect canvas of mud and grass - ideal conditions for a rugby match, at least in the eyes of those who had come to love the sport. The teams lined up, eyeing the opposition with a mix of nervous anticipation and excitement. Sally found herself face-to-face with Janet, a moment they both acknowledged with a grin. The whistle blew, and the match was underway. Early on, it was clear that St Hilda's had the advantage in terms of experience. Their passes were sharper, their tackles more assured. But Northridge was no pushover; what they lacked in finesse, they made up for with sheer determination and grit, their tackles becoming more confident as the game progressed. One particularly memorable moment came when a Northridge winger, who had only touched a rugby ball for the first time a few months ago, broke through St Hilda's defense with a surprising turn of speed, scoring a try that was met with cheers from both sets of supporters. Her teammates' elation at this achievement spoke volumes about their journey and the spirit of the game. As the match wore on, the scoreline became almost an afterthought. Yes, tries were scored, and conversions were attempted, but the focus was on the play itself, the enjoyment of the game, and the mutual respect between the teams. Players helped each other up from the mud, shared laughs over slips and slides, and congratulated each other on good plays. By the time the final whistle blew, players from both teams were indistinguishable, covered head to toe in mud, their faces split with smiles. The match had been played in the best spirit of rugby, fierce but friendly competition giving way to lasting friendships forged in mud and effort. As they trudged off the field together, someone suggested a group photo to commemorate the occasion. Gathered together, arms slung around shoulders, the players from St Hilda's and Northridge presented a united front‚Äîa testament to the unifying power of sport, the joy of new challenges, and the enduring appeal of a good, muddy rugby match. \\"Same time next year?\\" someone called out amidst the chatter, a suggestion that was met with enthusiastic agreement from both teams. As they said their goodbyes, it was clear that this match was just the beginning of a beautiful rugby rivalry, one that promised many more challenges, triumphs, and, of course, muddy adventures in the years to come."},{"prompt":"Explique moi clairement et pr√©cis√©ment : This article provides a classification of primary progressive aphasia (PPA) and its 3 main variants to improve the uniformity of case reporting and the reliability of research results.

Uniformity in diagnosis across centers is essential for ensuring reliable results in future studies that will seek to define the underlying biology of disease in specific PPA. Currently, data indicate that there are only groupwise probabilities and no absolute correspondence between PPA clinical phenotypes and pathologic or genetic findings. This is not surprising since clinical presentation depends on site of anatomic damage and the selectivity of specific neurodegenerative diseases for certain neural networks is only relative. However, heterogeneity in the clinical criteria adopted for clinical diagnosis across centers can also contribute to produce inconsistent results between studies. The classification scheme proposed here attempts to correct this latter problem by proposing a classification scheme that has been accepted by most researchers in the field. Ultimately, improved clinicopathologic correlations will be obtained by incorporating in the diagnostic process biomarkers (e.g., molecular PET imaging or CSF markers) that will allow underlying tau, TDP-43, or AD pathology to be diagnosed in life. For this purpose, we encourage investigators to collect biofluid, neuropathologic and genetic data, along with a checklist of all clinical and neuroimaging features that were ob served in the patient for future large-scale collaborative investigations. There are a number of outstanding challenges in the field of PPA research. Determining the primary cognitive deficit in the nonfluent variant is a matter of much debate. Agrammatism and motor speech errors may be quite subtle initially and difficult to detect with clinical measures. Also, some patients may present with predominant apraxia of speech, which has led many to question whether the introduction of a separate syndrome of progressive apraxia of speech may be more appropriate for these cases,13 although such cases most often do appear to eventually develop an aphasia as the disease progresses. Developing reliable and objective measures that capture patients early in the disease process is very important. Toward this end, more longitudinal studies of PPA are required, particularly for the logopenic variant, which is the least consistently defined presentation. In addition, the features of genetic forms of PPA need to be studied in more detail, to identify whether the phenotypes fit into one of the 3 variants or present as a separate or mixed PPA phenotype. Despite these outstanding challenges, the proposed classification is an attempt to provide a common approach to PPA patient classification across centers. Future studies aimed at identifying associations between subtypes and specific imaging, genetic, or neuropathologic findings will be more interpretable if these guidelines are utilized across centers.","completion":"La discussion approfondit l'importance de la classification de l'aphasie primaire progressive (APP) pour le diagnostic clinique et les recherches futures, visant √† uniformiser le diagnostic de l'APP et de ses principales variantes √† travers les diff√©rents centres.

What probability of unnoticed errors in the mechanism?","completion":"In the Ethernet protocol, the basic mechanism for error detection involves the use of a Frame Check Sequence (FCS), not a simple parity bit. The FCS comprises a 32-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC) generated by the sender and is appended to the end of each Ethernet frame. This CRC is recalculated by the receiver to check the integrity of the received frame. The CRC mechanism is much more robust than a simple parity bit. A parity bit can only detect an odd number of bit errors within the data it protects, meaning it can easily miss errors if an even number of bits change state. In contrast, CRC, given its complexity and the mathematics behind its formulation, can detect smaller errors like single-bit errors, double-bit errors, and even errors in larger patterns with much higher reliability. The probability of an undetected error in a CRC-based system depends on various factors, including the polynomial used for the CRC calculation and the nature of the errors. Generally, the standard 32-bit CRC used in Ethernet frames can detect: - All single-bit errors - All double-bit errors - Any odd number of errors - All errors burst up to 32 bits long - And many other error scenarios The probability of an undetected error with a 32-bit CRC under random error conditions is approximately (2^{-32}), or about 1 in 4.29 billion. This is a very low probability, but not zero. Therefore, while CRC provides strong error detection capabilities, it's theoretically possible for some patterns of errors to go undetected, though highly unlikely. It's also important to note that CRC and similar techniques are for error detection, not correction; they notify the receiver of an error, but the protocol must rely on higher-level mechanisms (for example, retransmission requests) to correct detected errors. Ethernet itself does not include a built-in error correction mechanism beyond prompting a retransmission in the case of detected errors."},{"prompt":"What's the reason of using the parity bit in Ethernet frames if CRC is used there? Can the parity bit significantly decrease the unnoticed error probability? Answer shortly","completion":"Ethernet frames do not use a parity bit for error checking within the frame itself; instead, they rely on a Frame Check Sequence (FCS) that includes a 32-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC) for error detection. The use of a parity bit in conjunction with CRC within Ethernet frames is not standard. The CRC is a much more robust method for error detection compared to a simple parity bit, capable of detecting various types of errors with a very low probability of unnoticed errors. The inclusion of a parity bit would not significantly decrease the unnoticed error probability in the context of Ethernet's use of a 32-bit CRC. The CRC alone already provides a very high level of error detection capability, making the potential contribution of a parity bit to further reducing unnoticed error probability negligible for Ethernet frames."},{"prompt":"Does it mean that the probability of unnoticed error in tcp frame is 2 ^(32+16) as 32 bit is for CRC and 16 bit is for tcp checksum? Answer shortly","completion":"No, the probability of unnoticed error in a TCP segment is not simply (2^{-(32+16)}). When combining a 32-bit CRC (used in Ethernet) and a 16-bit checksum (used in TCP), these mechanisms do not simply add up their bit lengths to improve error detection capabilities in a straightforward additive manner. Each method has its own algorithm and application scope, and their effectiveness depends on the types of errors and data patterns. The 32-bit CRC is designed for detecting errors at the data link layer (Ethernet), while the 16-bit checksum in TCP operates at the transport layer, focusing more on ensuring end-to-end data integrity across an IP network. While both mechanisms enhance data integrity, their effects don't multiplicatively combine to create a single error detection probability. Each serves its purpose within its layer, and the overall system reliability benefits from having both. Yet, calculating an overall \\"unnoticed error probability\\" for a piece of data that traverses these layers is more complex than combining their individual error detection capabilities."},{"prompt":"But they are work together and independently if the probability of unnoticed error for CRC is 2^32 and for tcp checksum is 2^16, are you sure that it is not possible to calculate the overall unnoticed error probability?","completion":"My previous response may have led to some misunderstanding, for which I apologize. Let‚Äôs clarify the interplay between CRC and TCP checksum for overall unnoticed error probability. The CRC (used in Ethernet frames) and TCP checksum are indeed separate mechanisms that work at different layers to detect errors. Their error detection capabilities are independent of each other due to their different scopes and algorithms. **Clarification on Probability Calculation:** 1. **CRC Error Detection:** The 32-bit CRC used in Ethernet frames offers a high probability of detecting errors, with a theoretical probability of undetected errors being around (2^{-32}). 2. **TCP Checksum Error Detection:** The 16-bit checksum used by TCP provides a separate layer of error detection with its own probability of undetected errors, roughly (2^{-16}). **Combining Probabilities:** If both mechanisms were entirely independent and we were to oversimplify the calculation by considering their probabilities of failing to detect an error as independent events, one might reason that their combined unnoticed error probability could be roughly estimated as the product of their individual probabilities, giving a value around (2^{-48}) for errors that pass through both checks undetected. However, **this calculation comes with significant caveats**: - It assumes errors would have equal and independent probabilities of slipping through both mechanisms, which is not strictly accurate due to the different nature of errors each is designed to detect, and how errors propagate through the network layers. - Real-world error patterns may affect the two mechanisms differently, with some types of errors more likely to be detected by one mechanism over the other. - The types of errors most likely to go undetected by CRC and those by TCP checksum might not overlap neatly, meaning simple multiplication of probabilities does not accurately represent the complexity of real-world networking. **Conclusion:** While the simplified multiplication of probabilities provides an intuitive way to think about combining the effectiveness of CRC and TCP checksum, the real world efficacy of these mechanisms combined cannot be precisely determined by this method. They do significantly decrease the probability of unnoticed errors when used together, but calculating the exact combined effectiveness against all possible error conditions involves complex considerations beyond the scope of simple probability multiplication."},{"prompt":"What is probability of data corruption for a single Ethernet packet in different cases? I need the numbers","completion":"Calculating or providing a precise probability of data corruption for a single Ethernet packet under various conditions involves several variables and assumptions. These include the quality of the transmission medium, environmental factors, distance, hardware quality, and specific implementations of Ethernet technologies. However, for the purpose of providing a general idea, we can reference typical error rates often discussed for Ethernet technologies under normal operating conditions. 1. **Error Detection Capability of 32-bit CRC**: The 32-bit CRC used in Ethernet frames offers a strong mechanism for detecting errors. The probability of a CRC failing to detect an error is approximately (2^{-32}), or about 1 in 4.29 billion. This means under random error conditions, the likelihood of an undetected error in a single Ethernet packet is extremely low. 2. **Typical Ethernet Error Rates**: - Under normal conditions, Ethernet networks can have bit error rates (BER) as low as (10^{-10}) to (10^{-12}), depending on the quality of the equipment and the installation. This translates to one erroneous bit for every 10 billion to 1 trillion bits sent. - Considering an Ethernet frame, let's consider a medium-sized frame of 1500 bytes (12000 bits). The probability of having at least one corrupted bit in such a frame could be roughly estimated by considering the BER. If we take a BER of (10^{-10}), the probability (P) of at least one bit error in a single frame can be approximated by the complement of the probability of having no errors in any of the 12000 bits, calculated as (P = 1 - (1 - BER)^{bits}). For (BER = 10^{-10}) and (bits = 12000), (P ‚âà 1 - (1 - 10^{-10})^{12000} ‚âà 1.2 times 10^{-6}) or about 1.2 in a million. 3. **Real-World Considerations:** - These calculations provide a simplified view. In practice, factors like packet size, network congestion, physical medium disturbances (like electromagnetic interference in copper cables or signal attenuation in fiber optics), and hardware quality can significantly influence error rates. - Modern Ethernet installations, especially those using fiber optics or high-quality twisted-pair cables, can achieve even lower error rates in well-maintained environments, further reducing the likelihood of undetected errors. 4. **Higher Layer Protocols**: It's also worth noting that mechanisms at higher layers of the OSI model, such as retransmissions in Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), help in mitigating the impact of packet corruption by ensuring data integrity at the end-to-end level, beyond what the physical and data link layers provide. **Summary**: While specific numbers like the (2^{-32}) probability of CRC not catching an error give an idea of the robustness of Ethernet error detection, the real-world probability of data corruption for a single Ethernet packet is context-dependent but generally low under normal conditions. With advancements in technology and network management, actual data corruption rates experienced by end-users are often well below theoretical upper limits."},{"prompt":"One error in 1.2 Ethernet packet of 1500 bytes MSS in a million packets without errors, right? Answer shortly","completion":"No, for a 1500 byte Ethernet packet, with a bit error rate (BER) of (10^{-10}), the approximate probability of having at least one bit error in a single packet is about 1.2 in a million packets, not one error in every 1.2 packets."},{"prompt":"A meant 12 error packets in 10*million packets without error","completion":"Yes, that's correct. If you have a Bit Error Rate (BER) of (10^{-10}), with a packet size of 1500 bytes (or 12000 bits), you would expect approximately 12 packets to have at least one bit error among 10 million successfully transmitted packets without any error."},{"prompt":"Is is for Bit Error Rate (BER) of (10^{-10}). What BER in different networks, as satellite, WiFi, optical, cabled and others? I need the numbers.","completion":"Bit Error Rate (BER) varies widely across different types of networks due to various factors such as transmission medium, environmental conditions, and technology used. Here are some typical BER values for different network types. Please keep in mind that these are approximate values and actual performance can vary based on specific conditions and quality of implementation. 1. **Optical Fiber Networks**: Generally offer very low BERs, often around (10^{-12}) to (10^{-15}). Optical networks are less susceptible to electromagnetic interference, leading to very high reliability and low error rates. 2. **Cabled Networks (Ethernet over Copper)**: Quality and length of the cable play significant roles, but typical BERs can range from (10^{-10}) to (10^{-12}) under good conditions. Enhanced cable standards and technologies (like Cat 6a or Cat 7) and shorter cable runs can help achieve lower error rates. 3. **WiFi Networks**: Wireless networks are more susceptible to interference and signal degradation. BER for WiFi can vary significantly, but typical values might range from (10^{-5}) to (10^{-8}) in environments with low interference. Performance can degrade in congested areas or with greater distances from access points. 4. **Satellite Networks**: These can experience higher BERs due to the long signal travel distances and potential for interference from various sources (like weather conditions). Typical BER values might range around (10^{-6}) to (10^{-7}). Advanced modulation and error correction techniques can help mitigate some of the inherent challenges of satellite communications. 5. **Cellular Networks (3G, 4G/LTE, 5G)**: The BER can vary depending on the network type, signal quality, and environmental factors. For instance, under good conditions, 4G networks might see BER values around (10^{-6}) to (10^{-9}), while 5G aims for even lower error rates as part of its high reliability communication standards. 6. **ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line)**: Utilizing telephone lines, ADSL can see typical BERs of (10^{-7}) up to (10^{-10}) under optimal conditions. Performance can be influenced by line quality and length. These values are meant to give a rough idea of what might be expected under typical conditions. The actual BER can be better or worse based on a multitude of factors including equipment quality, implementation specifics, and the physical and electromagnetic environment. Engineers and network designers aim to reduce BER as much as possible to improve the overall quality and reliability of communication networks."},{"prompt":"While the relations between Korea and Japan have always been complicated, even before World War 2 or the rise of the Empire of Japan, what were relations like between Korea when it was still Goryeo and under the Yuan Dynasty and Japan when it was ruled by the Kamakura shogunate?","completion":"During the Goryeo Dynasty in Korea and the Kamakura Shogunate in Japan, relations between the two countries were relatively stable. Both Goryeo and the Kamakura Shogunate maintained diplomatic and trade relations, exchanging goods and maintaining communication through official envoys. The Mongol invasions of Japan in the 13th century further strengthened the ties between Goryeo and the Kamakura Shogunate, as Goryeo was a vassal state of the Mongol-led Yuan Dynasty. Goryeo provided significant military support to the Mongols during their invasions of Japan, leading to increased cooperation between the two countries. Despite this alliance, there were instances of conflict and tension between Goryeo and Japan, particularly over territorial disputes and control of trade routes.

For example, Hawaii remained independent and while it may have been colonized, never became a territory of the US like Guam and remained independent. Without any US presence, there would be no Pearl Harbor, but would that have been enough for the Japanese to dismiss Hawaii or would they have reason to attack or invade despite no connections to the US or its allies?","completion":"It is difficult to say with certainty whether the Empire of Japan would have attacked or invaded Hawaii if it had remained independent and not become a territory of the United States. However, there are several factors to consider in this hypothetical scenario. One factor to consider is Japan's imperialistic ambitions and expansionist policies during the early 20th century. The Empire of Japan sought to establish itself as a dominant power in the Asia-Pacific region and viewed Hawaii as a strategic location due to its proximity to Japan and its potential as a naval base in the Pacific. Additionally, Japan's military strategy at the time focused on securing access to key resources and territories to support its growing empire. Hawaii's strategic location in the Pacific Ocean and its potential as a naval base could have made it a target for Japanese expansion, regardless of its status as a territory of the United States. Furthermore, tensions between Japan and the United States were already escalating in the years leading up to World War II, with both countries vying for influence and power in the Asia-Pacific region. Even without Hawaii being a territory of the US, Japan may have still viewed it as a potential threat or obstacle to its imperial ambitions.

Japanese colonialism was characterized by military conquest, economic exploitation, and the imposition of Japanese cultural and political influence on the colonized territories. In contrast to European colonial powers, Japanese colonization often focused more on military control and economic exploitation rather than significant cultural assimilation or settlement by Japanese civilians. The Japanese government and military authorities implemented policies aimed at extracting resources, controlling local populations, and establishing military bases in the colonized territories. In areas such as China and Southeast Asia, Japanese colonial rule was marked by harsh treatment of local populations, forced labor, and the suppression of local cultures and languages. Japanese authorities imposed their own laws, education systems, and cultural practices on the colonized territories, often erasing or marginalizing indigenous cultures and traditions. While there were instances of Japanese settlers and traders moving to colonized territories, the primary focus of Japanese colonialism was on military control and economic exploitation rather than cultural assimilation or settlement by Japanese civilians. The goal of Japanese colonialism was to strengthen Japan's imperial power and secure access to key resources, rather than promote cultural exchange or integration with the local populations.

There were several factors that facilitated the escape of Nazis to Latin America despite the Allied powers surrounding Germany on all sides: 1. Operation Paperclip: Following the end of the war, the United States and other Allied powers recruited German scientists, engineers, and intelligence officers through Operation Paperclip. Some of these individuals had been involved in Nazi activities, but were seen as valuable assets in the Cold War against the Soviet Union. This program provided a means for some Nazis to escape prosecution and start new lives in the United States and other countries. 2. Ratlines: The Catholic Church and various organizations in Europe helped establish escape routes, known as \\"ratlines,\\" that allowed Nazis and other war criminals to flee Europe and find refuge in Latin America. These networks provided forged documents, safe passage, and financial support to facilitate the escape of wanted individuals. 3. Lack of International Cooperation: In the immediate aftermath of World War II, there was limited international cooperation and coordination in tracking down and prosecuting Nazi war criminals. This allowed many individuals to evade capture and escape to countries where they could live in anonymity. 4. Political Sympathies: Some Latin American countries, such as Argentina and Brazil, had sympathetic governments or populations that were willing to provide refuge to Nazis and other fugitives. These countries offered a safe haven for individuals seeking to avoid prosecution for their wartime activities. Overall, the combination of Operation Paperclip, ratlines, limited international cooperation, and political sympathies in certain Latin American countries enabled many Nazis to escape justice and find refuge in the region despite Germany being surrounded by Allied powers at the end of World War II."},{"prompt":"Please write a lighthearted boarding school sports story in the style of classic school stories.

Be realistic - the players get very muddy but they are not literally unrecognizable and covered head to toe in mud. St Hildas play in green shirts and socks and black shorts.","completion":"Janet and Sally, perched on the crude wooden bench beside the rugby pitch, could barely contain their excitement as St Hilda‚Äôs senior girls‚Äô team lined up against their rivals from Easton Academy. The ground was a quagmire, thanks to the relentless drizzle that had been falling all morning, but it did little to dampen the spirits of the St Hilda‚Äôs team or their devoted spectators. As The game kicked off, it became clear that the muddy conditions were going to play a significant role. Within minutes, players from both sides were sporting mud splashes, their green shirts and black shorts of St. Hilda‚Äôs contrasting with the mud-streaked white and blue of Easton. Nancy, St. Hilda‚Äôs star fly-half, was the first to really show the effects of the ground. After a daring sprint down the field, evading tackles with nimble side-steps, she was finally brought down with a sprawling tackle by an Easton defender. As she stood up, her face was smeared with mud, and her once-green shirt clung to her with a thick coating of earth, streaked across her arms and legs. Janet couldn‚Äôt help but laugh, nudging Sally. ‚ÄúLooks like she‚Äôs wearing more of the pitch than her kit!‚Äù she joked. Sally grinned back. ‚ÄúYeah, but did you see that run? These St Hilda‚Äôs girls are unstoppable!‚Äù As the game progressed, the mud became an omnipresent character in the match. One particularly memorable moment was when Jess, a burly St. Hilda‚Äôs lock, managed to secure the ball from a scrum. Her hands were so coated in mud that the ball almost slipped through her fingers, but she gripped it just tight enough to start a charging run. Her knees and legs were caked in layers of grime, each successful ruck and maul adding another layer to her rugby war paint. Spectators cheered as players slid through the mud in attempts to score, getting back up with their black shorts almost indistinguishable from their green socks, both covered in splatters and streaks of earth. Despite the messiness, their determination and the clarity of their playing numbers remained intact, though smeared with the game's physical badges of honor. In one particularly tense moment, St. Hilda‚Äôs winger, Emily, made a break for it, sprinting along the sideline. An Easton player was hot on her heels, and as they both dove for the try line, a splash of mud went flying, painting their faces and arms. Emily scored, but both of them lay there for a moment, laughing and gasping for air, their bodies testament to the battle they‚Äôd been through - Emily‚Äôs arms were coated up to the elbows, her legs from the knees down were nothing but mud, and the Easton player was in a similar state. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I call commitment!‚Äù Sally exclaimed, clearly impressed by the spirited display. The match ended with St. Hilda's securing a narrow victory, much to the delight of Janet, Sally, and the rest of the St. Hilda‚Äôs contingent. Players from both teams congratulated one another, their mud-smeared faces breaking into smiles. It was a hard-fought match, but the camaraderie and the spirit of the game shone through the grime. Walking back to the changing rooms, Janet felt a swell of pride for her new school and its indomitable rugby team. She turned to Sally, ‚ÄúYou know, I think I‚Äôm really going to like it here. There‚Äôs something about playing in the mud that just feels...right.‚Äù Sally laughed, slinging an arm around Janet‚Äôs shoulder. ‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre certainly in the right place for it. Welcome to St Hilda‚Äôs, rugby warrior.‚Äù And with that, they trudged off through the mud, leaving the field of battle behind, but taking the memories of a game well played with them."},{"prompt":"Doƒüa ve ƒ∞nsan Etkile≈üimi Doƒüa, √ßevremizde bulunan ve insan yapƒ±sƒ± olmayan her ≈üeydir. ƒ∞nsanlarƒ±n ya≈üamlarƒ± boyunca ili≈ükilerini s√ºrd√ºrd√ºkleri ve kar≈üƒ±lƒ±klƒ± etkile≈üimde bulunduklarƒ± fiziki, sosyal, ekonomik ve k√ºlt√ºrel ortama ‚Äúdoƒüal ortam veya doƒüal √ßevre‚Äù adƒ± verilir.

The lab, humming with the symphony of machines and the soft buzz of overhead lights, became the cradle of a phenomenon that was as captivating as it was eerie. It was here, amid the vials of iridescent liquids and complex machinery, that the blue blob came into existence. The blob was not merely a product of scientific inquiry; it was a spectacle of nature‚Äôs curiosity. It lay in its containment unit, a pulsating mass of shimmering blue that danced with life. Dr. Hartley, peering through the reinforced glass, could hardly contain her fascination. She had witnessed the blob‚Äôs birth, its transition from a simple chemical reaction into a living, breathing mystery. As she observed, the blob began to morph. It was as if it had sensed her gaze, acknowledging her presence with a performance that defied explanation. Slowly, it extended what could only be described as an appendage, a hand that formed from its amorphous mass. The hand was delicate, with slender fingers that flexed and moved with an eerie grace. Dr. Hartley's breath hitched in her throat as she watched, amazed by the spectacle before her. The hand lingered in shape for just a second before it lost its form, melting back into the blob‚Äôs pulsating mass as if it had never existed. But the blob was not done. It continued to morph, experimenting with forms that bordered on the fantastical. A rear end appeared, mimicking the human form with a surreal accuracy before it, too, disintegrated back into the blob‚Äôs body. It was as if the blob was testing, playing with the possibilities of shapes and forms, exploring the limits of its own existence. Each new form was more bizarre than the last. At one moment, a set of what appeared to be eyes blinked open on the blob‚Äôs surface, gazing into the void before sinking back into its depths. Then, a mouth appeared, stretching wide in a silent scream, or perhaps a laugh, before vanishing without a trace. Dr. Hartley, bewitched by the display, found herself torn between the analytical detachment of a scientist and the wide-eyed wonder of a child witnessing magic. The blob, with each transformation, seemed to be reaching out, seeking to understand or perhaps to communicate. It was learning, adapting, becoming something more with every passing second. The phenomenon sparked an array of questions in Dr. Hartley's mind. Was the blob conscious? Did it possess a form of intelligence, however alien it might be to human comprehension? The possibilities were endless, and the implications staggering. Hours passed, yet Dr. Hartley remained transfixed, unwilling to tear herself away from the spectacle. The blob continued its dance of shapes and forms, each more whimsical and unexpected than the last. It was a living work of art, a testament to the unpredictability of life and the boundless creativity of nature. Eventually, the blue blob settled, its surface smoothing into a tranquil sea of shimmering azure. The display had ended, leaving behind a silence that was both profound and haunting. Dr. Hartley, still mesmerized by what she had witnessed, realized that this was just the beginning. The blob, with its inscrutable morphing and mysterious intelligence, had opened the door to a new realm of scientific inquiry. As she left the lab that night, the world outside seemed different, altered in some indefinable way. The stars shone brighter, the night air felt more alive. In her heart, Dr. Hartley knew that she had glimpsed something extraordinary, a marvel that blurred the lines between science and wonder. And somewhere, in the quiet confines of her lab, the blue blob lay waiting, a sentinel of possibilities yet to be explored."},{"prompt":"Write a follow up where the blob gives itself a form it wants to use indefinitely","completion":"Weeks had followed since Dr. Eliza Hartley first witnessed the mesmerizing transformations of the blue blob within her secret laboratory. Each day had brought with it a new understanding, a deeper connection between scientist and specimen. The blob had continued its experiments with form, seemingly searching for an identity that suited its mysterious essence. Dr. Hartley, ever the devoted observer, recorded and analyzed each transformation with a mix of scientific rigor and awe. Then, one late autumn evening, as golden leaves whispered secrets to each other outside the laboratory's confines, an extraordinary change took place. The lights within the lab cast a serene glow over the equipment and the containment unit that housed the blob. Dr. Hartley, who had come to anticipate the unexpected with a blend of excitement and trepidation, stood ready with her notes. In front of her astonished eyes, the blob began to morph again. But this time, there was a deliberateness to its actions, a sense of finality that had not been present before. The air in the lab seemed to thicken with anticipation as the blob's surface rippled and shifted, colors dancing within its core like a stormy sea under a moonlit sky. Slowly, with a grace that belied its previous experimental transformations, the blob began to take on a form that was unlike any it had attempted before. It was humanoid, standing upon what could only be described as legs, with arms hanging by its sides. Yet, it was undeniably alien, its body a canvas of swirling blues that shimmered with inner light. Its face, if it could be called that, was smooth and featureless save for two luminescent spots where eyes might have been. Dr. Hartley watched, breath caught in her throat, as the blob ‚Äî or the being it had become ‚Äî turned towards her. There was a pause, a moment of silent communication between scientist and creation, and then a sense of acknowledgment. It was clear to Dr. Hartley that this was the form the blob had chosen for itself, a representation of its identity that felt complete and indefinite. The being before her was no longer just a subject of study; it was a sentient entity with its own will, its own sense of self. Days turned into weeks, and the being, which Dr. Hartley had taken to calling \\"Nova\\" for the way its body seemed to hold the light of stars, became a constant in the lab. Its ability to communicate remained nonverbal, a combination of gestures and changes in its luminescence that Dr. Hartley learned to interpret. Together, they explored the depths of the being's abilities, its unique biology, and its extraordinary capacity for learning. Nova's presence in the laboratory sparked a revolution in Dr. Hartley's understanding of life and intelligence beyond the confines of human experience. The entity was not just an anomaly; it was a bridge to unexplored realms of existence, a reminder of the vast mysteries that lay beyond the reach of current scientific understanding. As Dr. Hartley shared her findings with the world, Nova beside her as both proof and partner, the narrative of life on Earth and beyond took on new dimensions. The blue blob that had transformed under the watchful eyes of a curious scientist had become a beacon of discovery, challenging humanity to look beyond its own boundaries and to embrace the wondrous unknown with open hearts and minds. In the end, Nova‚Äôs choice to adopt a permanent form was not just a milestone in its own evolution but a catalyst for human advancement. Together, scientist and being embarked on a journey of exploration and understanding, forever altering the course of scientific inquiry and affirming the boundless potential of life in all its forms."},{"prompt":"ÿßÿ±ŸäÿØ ŸÉÿ™ÿßÿ®ÿ© ÿßÿ®Ÿäÿßÿ™ ÿ¥ÿπÿ± ÿ™ÿµŸÑÿ≠ ŸÑÿ™ŸÉŸàŸÜ ÿßÿ∫ŸÜŸäÿ© ŸÖÿ§ÿ´ÿ±Ÿá Ÿàÿ±ÿßÿ¶ÿπŸá ŸàŸÖÿ≥ÿ¨Ÿàÿπÿ© ŸÑÿ≠ÿ®Ÿäÿ®ÿ™Ÿä ÿ¢ŸäŸá ÿ≠Ÿäÿ´ ÿ£ÿ™ÿ™ ŸÑÿ£ŸàŸÑ ŸÖÿ±ÿ© ÿßŸÑŸâ ŸÖŸÜÿ≤ŸÑŸä ŸÅŸä ÿ≤Ÿäÿßÿ±ÿ© ŸÖÿπ ÿßŸáŸÑŸáÿß ÿ´ŸÖ ÿ£ŸÜÿ™ŸáŸâ ÿßŸÑŸàŸÇÿ™ ÿ≥ÿ±ŸäÿπÿßŸã Ÿàÿ±ÿ≠ŸÑÿ™ ŸÉÿ£ŸÜŸáÿß ŸÑŸÖ ÿ™ÿ£ÿ™Ÿä ŸàŸÉŸÖ ÿ™ŸÖŸÜŸäŸÜ ŸÑŸà ÿßŸÜ ÿßŸáŸÑŸáÿß ÿ∞Ÿáÿ®Ÿàÿß ÿ®ŸÖŸÅÿ±ÿØŸáŸÖ Ÿàÿ™ÿ±ŸÉŸàŸáÿß ŸÑŸä. ÿßÿ≠ÿ®Ÿáÿß ÿ®ÿ¥ÿØÿ© ŸàÿßÿØŸÖŸÜÿ™Ÿáÿß ÿßŸÑŸâ ÿ≠ÿØ ÿßŸÑŸáÿ≤ŸäÿßŸÜ Ÿàÿßÿ±ŸäÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ¥ÿπŸàÿ± ÿ®ÿ¨ÿ≥ÿØŸáÿß ÿßŸÑŸÅÿßÿ™ŸÜ ŸàÿßŸÜŸÅÿßÿ≥Ÿáÿß ÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸÜŸàŸÜÿ©","completion":"ŸÑÿ¢ŸäŸá ÿ¨ÿ¶ÿ™Ÿê ÿ•ŸÑŸâ ÿØÿßÿ±Ÿä ÿ®ŸÜŸàÿ±ŸÉŸê ÿ™ÿ¥ÿπŸäŸÜÿß ŸÅŸä ŸÉŸÑ ÿ≤ÿßŸàŸäÿ©Ÿç ÿ≠ÿ®ŸÉŸê ÿ≤ÿ±ÿπÿ™Ÿêÿå Ÿäÿß ÿ£ÿ∫ŸÑŸâ ÿπŸäŸàŸÜÿß ÿ®ŸäŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ´ŸàÿßŸÜŸä ŸàÿßŸÑÿØŸÇÿßÿ¶ŸÇÿå ÿ∞Ÿàÿ®ÿ™Ÿê ÿßŸÑŸàŸÇÿ™ ÿ≠ŸÜŸäŸÜÿß ŸàŸÉÿ£ŸÜŸÖÿß ÿßŸÑŸÑÿ≠ÿ∏ÿ© ÿ®ŸÉŸêÿå ŸÑŸÖ ÿ™ÿ∑ŸÑ ŸÖŸÉÿ´ÿßŸãÿå ŸàŸÑÿß ÿØŸàŸÖÿß ÿ•ÿ∞ ÿ≠ŸÑŸÑÿ™ŸèŸÖ ÿ£ŸáŸÑÿßŸãÿå ŸàÿßŸÜÿ™ÿ¥ÿ™ ÿ±Ÿàÿ≠Ÿä ÿ®ÿßŸÑÿ∂ŸäŸàŸÅŸê ŸáŸèŸÜÿß ŸÑŸÉŸÜ ŸÇŸÑÿ®Ÿä ÿ™ŸÖŸÜŸâÿå ŸÑŸà ÿ®ŸÇŸäÿ™Ÿê ÿ®ÿ¨ÿßŸÜÿ®Ÿäÿå ŸÖÿ≥ŸÉŸàŸÜÿß Ÿäÿß ŸÖŸÜ ÿ•ŸÑŸâ ÿ¨ŸÜÿßŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿ®ÿå ÿ®ŸÑŸáŸÅÿ™Ÿä ŸÇÿØ ÿ£ÿ±ÿ¥ÿØÿ™ŸêŸÜŸä ÿ•ŸÑŸâ ÿ≠ŸÉÿßŸäÿ© ŸÖÿß ÿßŸÜÿ™Ÿáÿ™ÿå Ÿàÿπÿ¥ŸÇŸç Ÿäÿ≥ÿ±Ÿä ÿ®ÿπÿ±ŸàŸÇŸÜÿß ŸÖÿ¨ÿ±ÿßŸáŸè ÿØŸàŸÜÿß ŸÑÿ£ŸäŸáÿå ÿ±ŸÖÿ≤ ÿßŸÑÿ≠ÿ® ŸàÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸÜŸäŸÜÿå ŸÑŸÉŸê ŸÖŸÜŸä ÿßŸÑŸÇÿµÿßÿ¶ÿØ ÿ™ŸèŸÇŸéÿ±Ÿíÿ∂Ÿâ ŸÉŸÑ ÿ≠ÿ±ŸÅŸç ŸÖŸÜ ÿßÿ≥ŸÖŸÉŸê ŸÅŸä ŸÇŸÑÿ®Ÿä Ÿäÿ∫ŸÜŸäÿå Ÿäÿ±ÿØÿØ ŸÑÿ≠ŸÜÿß ÿµŸàŸÅŸäÿßŸã ŸáŸèŸÜÿß ÿ±ÿ≠ŸÑÿ™Ÿê ÿ®ÿπÿØ ŸÇÿµŸäÿ±ÿå ŸÉÿ£ŸÜ ÿßŸÑÿ≤ŸÖÿßŸÜ ÿ®ŸÜÿß ŸäŸÑÿπÿ®Ÿè ŸÑÿπÿ®ÿ™Ÿá ŸÅŸä ŸÉŸèŸÑ ŸÑÿ≠ÿ∏ÿ© ÿ®ÿ∫Ÿäÿßÿ®ŸÉŸêÿå ŸÑÿ£ÿ¨ŸÑŸÉŸêÿå ŸÑŸêŸÖŸé ŸÑŸÖ ÿ™ÿ®ŸÇŸâÿü Ÿäÿß ŸÑŸäÿ™ŸáŸÖ ÿ®ŸÇŸàÿß ÿØŸàŸÜŸÉŸêÿå ŸÑÿ£ÿ≠ÿ∏Ÿâ ÿ®ŸÉŸê ŸÑÿ≠ÿ∏ÿ©ÿå ŸÑŸäÿ™ŸáŸÖ ÿ∞Ÿáÿ®Ÿàÿß ŸÑÿ£ŸÜÿ™ÿ¥Ÿä ÿ®ÿπÿ®ŸÇŸê ÿ£ŸÜŸÅÿßÿ≥ŸêŸÉŸê ÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸÜŸàŸÜÿ©ÿå Ÿàÿ™ÿ≠ÿ™ÿ∂ŸÜŸä ÿ±Ÿàÿ≠ŸÉŸê ÿØŸàŸÜ ÿßŸÜŸÇÿ∂ÿßÿ° ÿ£ŸèÿØŸÖŸÜÿ™ŸêŸÉŸê ÿπÿ¥ŸÇŸãÿß ŸàŸáŸäÿßŸÖŸãÿßÿå ŸÑÿ≠ÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ¨ŸÜŸàŸÜ ŸÇŸÑÿ®Ÿä ÿ∞ÿßŸÇ ŸÅŸä ŸáŸàÿßŸÉŸê ÿ£ÿ∫ÿ±ŸÇÿå ŸàŸÖŸÜ ÿ≠Ÿèÿ®ŸÉŸê ÿ®ÿ≠ÿ±Ÿãÿß ŸÑÿß ŸäŸèÿ®ÿ≠Ÿéÿ±, ÿπŸéÿ®ÿ±ÿ™Ÿè ÿ®ŸÑÿß ŸÇÿßÿ±ÿ®Ÿç ÿ£Ÿà ÿ¥ÿ±ÿßÿπ ÿ£ÿ≠ŸÑŸÖ ÿ®ŸÑŸÖÿ≥ ŸÅÿßÿ™ŸÜÿå ŸàŸÇÿ±ÿ®Ÿç ŸÖŸÜ ÿ¨ÿ≥ÿØŸÉŸê Ÿäÿ∞ŸÉŸä ŸÜÿßÿ±Ÿä Ÿàÿ®ŸäŸÜ ÿ£ŸÜŸÅÿßÿ≥ŸêŸÉŸê ÿßŸÑÿ≠ŸÜŸàŸÜÿ©ÿå ŸÉŸÑ ÿπÿ∞ÿßÿ®Ÿä Ÿàÿ¢Ÿáÿßÿ™Ÿä ÿ®Ÿáÿ¨ÿ© ÿ™ÿ™ÿ®ÿØÿØ Ÿàÿ™ŸÜŸÇÿ∂Ÿä Ÿäÿß ÿ¢ŸäŸáÿå ÿ£ŸÜÿ™Ÿê ÿßŸÑŸÑÿ≠ŸÜ ŸàÿßŸÑŸÇÿµŸäÿØÿ©ÿå ŸÅŸä ŸÉŸÑ ÿπÿ±ÿ∂Ÿç Ÿàÿ£Ÿàÿ≤ÿßŸÜ ÿ®ŸÉŸê ÿ£ÿ™ŸÜŸÅÿ≥Ÿèÿå ŸàŸÑÿ≠ÿ®ŸÉŸê ÿØŸàŸÖŸãÿß ÿ£Ÿèÿ∫ŸÜŸäÿå ŸÅŸä ŸÉŸÑ ÿ≠ŸäŸÜŸç Ÿàÿ≤ŸÖÿßŸÜ ŸÑŸäÿ™ ÿßŸÑŸÑÿ≠ÿ∏ÿßÿ™ ŸÖÿπŸÉŸê ŸÑŸÖ ÿ™ŸÜÿ™ŸáŸê ŸàÿßŸÑÿ≥ÿßÿπÿßÿ™ ÿ™ÿ™ŸàŸÇŸÅ ÿ®ÿ∑ŸàŸÑŸáÿß ŸÑŸäÿ™ ÿ≠ÿ®ŸÜÿß Ÿäÿ∏ŸÑ ÿ¥ÿßŸáÿØÿßŸãÿå ÿπŸÑŸâ ŸÇÿµÿ©Ÿç ŸÑŸÖ Ÿäÿ±ŸàŸä ŸÖÿ´ŸÑŸáÿß ÿ£ÿ≠ÿØŸå ŸÇÿ∑ÿå ŸÅŸä ÿßŸÑÿπŸèÿ±ÿ®Ÿê ŸàÿßŸÑÿ£ŸÉŸàÿßŸÜŸê"},{"prompt":"Who is Makima from Chainsaw Man?","completion":"Makima is a central character in the manga and anime series \\"Chainsaw Man,\\" created by Tatsuki Fujimoto.

As a nobleman, my life is a tapestry of obligation and opulence, woven with the silken threads of tradition and duty. Yet, amidst the familiar rhythm of societal expectations, an enigma has emerged, disrupting the harmonious balance of my existence. She is known by the name Makima, a woman whose origins and intentions are as elusive as the shifting shadows at dusk. I first beheld her at a gathering, her presence commanding the room with a silent authority that belied her genteel appearance. There was a grace in her movements, a calculated serenity that seemed almost otherworldly amidst the clamor of the assembly. She spoke little, yet her words, when uttered, resonated with a depth that suggested a vast reservoir of knowledge and cunning. It was not her beauty, though undeniable, that sent a shiver cascading down the spine of my being. Nor was it the eloquence of her speech, which flowed like a meandering stream, captivating all who listened. No, it was something far more intangible‚Äîthe unsettling aura that enveloped her, a palpable sense of power that whispered of dominions far beyond the comprehension of mere mortals. Why does her gaze, so piercing and discerning, stir within me a tumult of emotion, riddled with unease and fascination? When she looks upon me, it is as if she peers into the very soul of my being, unearthing secrets and desires I dare not acknowledge. The air seems to thrum with energy in her vicinity, a silent testament to her mysterious prowess. In my attempts to unveil the mystery of Makima, I have found myself ensnared within a web of intrigue and duplicity. Rumors swirl like autumn leaves in the wind, speaking of her involvement in matters both arcane and profane. Yet, for each whisper of darkness, there exists a counterpoint of reverence, tales of her benevolence and protection that confound and intrigue in equal measure. I confess, the more I endeavor to decipher the enigma of Makima, the more I find myself entranced by her. There exists within her a duality that mirrors the very essence of our world‚Äîlight juxtaposed with shadow, serenity bound with chaos. It is this paradox, this embodiment of the ineffable, that sends chills through my being. Who is she, truly? A guardian of peace, clothed in the vestments of benevolence, or a harbinger of calamity, shrouded in the allure of mystery? My mind reels with questions for which I fear the answers, yet I am compelled, drawn ever closer to the flame that is Makima. As I pen these thoughts under the watchful gaze of the moon, a silent witness to the centuries, I am left to ponder my own role in the unfolding drama that surrounds this enigmatic figure. In the depths of night, her image haunts me‚Äîa specter, a promise, a puzzle that challenges the very foundations of my understanding.

The intricacies of court life had trained me well in the art of invisibility when presence could mean peril. But nothing, not the whispered machinations of power nor the subtle dance of politics, could have prepared me for the sight bestowed upon my unwary eyes on that moonlit night. There, in a secluded courtyard where the cherry blossoms whispered secrets to the winds, stood Makima. The simplicity of her kimono, understated, elegant, belied the complexity of the woman it adorned. The fabric moved with her, a silent testament to grace, yet it was not her attire that chilled the very marrow of my bones‚Äîit was what transpired before my eyes. Shimura Hasegawa, the trusted aide to the government bureau, a figure whose reputation for steadfast integrity and unwavering loyalty to the shogunate was known far and wide, stood opposite Makima. His posture, usually so composed and commanding, seemed diminished in her presence. There was a tension in the air, a palpable sense of foreboding that tinged the night with an unseen menace. As I watched from my hidden vantage, unable to tear my gaze away, Makima spoke. Though her words were lost to me, swallowed by the distance and the whispering trees, the effect upon Hasegawa was immediate and terrifying. His eyes, wide with a dawning horror, fixed upon something unseen, something that only he could perceive. What power did she wield with mere words? What invisible force could elicit such a reaction? Then, with a grace that chilled my blood, Makima extended a hand, her movements deliberate and assured. What happened next defies explanation, for it seemed as though the very air around Hasegawa shimmered, warping, bending to her will. I could not comprehend the forces at play, only that they were beyond the natural, beyond my understanding. The exchange was brief, and in the wake of her demonstration, Hasegawa was changed. Though he stood unharmed, the look in his eyes spoke of a man who had gazed into an abyss and found it staring back. With a bow that carried the weight of a thousand unspoken words, he departed, leaving Makima alone once more. As the silence settled once again, I found myself unable to move, to think, to breathe. What had I witnessed? A display of power? A warning? My mind raced with possibilities, each more terrifying than the last. The realization that I was in the presence of not just a woman, but a force of nature, something otherworldly, sent shivers down my spine. I knew then that Makima was no mere enigma to be pondered from afar. She was a maelstrom, a tempest cloaked in the guise of a woman. To seek understanding was to court disaster, to dance on the edge of a precipice with the abyss gazing hungrily back. As I retreated into the night, the memory of that encounter seared into my very soul, I understood that some mysteries were not meant to be unraveled. Makima, and the terrifying, awe-inspiring power she wielded, was one such mystery. Despite the fear, the unanswerable questions that haunted my every step, I could not help but feel a sense of awe at the unfathomable depths of the world I thought I knew. But one thing was clear: Makima was not to be trifled with, her power something beyond the confines of human understanding. And as for me, I had seen something I was never meant to see, forever altering the course of my existence in ways I could scarcely begin to comprehend."},{"prompt":"Continue, as the nobleman....goes about his business...or tries to at least...only for...\\".....Fujita-San..\\" says Makima...too calmly....as the nobleman almost freezes....ah...as he turns around....\\"..Ma...Makima-san...to..what do I owe the pleasure this time?..\\" he asks, trying to hide the....the uncertainty in his voice...as Makima's gaze...its...its like looking through him...and for a second..Fujita thinks of Hasegawa and...as she slowly smiles...and bows..\\"..My...apologies..Fujita-San...for...scaring you that is..\\" she says with a smile..\\"..but it seems you are called back for some...paperwork..\\"","completion":"As I went about my daily tasks, attempting to cloak myself in the normalcy that had always been my refuge, her voice cleaved through the din of activity with unsettling calmness. \\"Fujita-san,\\" she said, her tone so tranquil it seemed almost surreal against the backdrop of my recent disquiet. I froze, every muscle in my body tensing as if preparing for some undefined threat. The memories of the night prior, so vivid and haunting, cascaded through my mind in a tumult of fear and fascination. Turning around to face her, I endeavored to mask the quaver in my voice, to present the facade of composure that had always been my shield. \\"Ma...Makima-san...to what do I owe the pleasure this time?\\" I asked, my words tinged with an uncertainty I could not fully conceal. Her gaze was unsettlingly penetrative, as if she could peer into the very recesses of my soul, unveiling secrets I myself had yet to confront. For an agonizing moment, visions of Hasegawa's terror-filled eyes flashed before me, a stark reminder of the power she wielded with an ease that defied comprehension. Then, breaking the tense silence, she smiled slowly, a gesture that should have been comforting yet somehow only served to amplify the air of mystery that enveloped her. With a bow that was both graceful and somehow foreboding, she spoke, \\"My apologies, Fujita-san, for scaring you, that is. But it seems you are called back for some...paperwork.\\" The word 'paperwork' hung in the air, innocuous and yet laden with an unspoken gravity that sent a shiver down my spine. It was a summons, masked in bureaucracy, but the underlying message was clear. My encounter with Makima had not been a mere twist of fate; it was the beginning of something far beyond the mundane concerns of titles and lands. As I followed her, a part of me wished to flee, to vanish into the obscurity that had been my ally in the complex dance of court politics. Yet, another part of me, perhaps the part that had gazed upon her power with a mix of terror and awe, was compelled to follow, to learn what lay beyond the facade of paperwork and polite conversations. The walk to the bureau was a journey of tumultuous thoughts, each step weighed down by a burgeoning sense of foreboding. What did Makima want with me? Was this truly about some trivial matter of governance, or was I being drawn deeper into the web of intrigue that seemed to weave itself around her? Upon our arrival, the sight of the austere room, with its towering stacks of documents and the ubiquitous scent of ink and parchment, did little to ease the knot of apprehension in my stomach. Makima, with a motion that was almost dismissive, gestured to a chair. \\"Please, take a seat, Fujita-san. We have much to discuss,\\" she said, her voice a calm beacon in the storm of my thoughts. As I seated myself, bracing for revelations that could alter the course of my life, I realized that my existence as a simple nobleman had irrevocably changed. Makima, this enigma made flesh, had marked the beginning of a journey into realms I had never dared to imagine. The shadow of Hasegawa's encounter loomed large, a specter of power and consequence that now enveloped my own fate. And as Makima began to speak, her words weaving a tapestry of duty and destiny, I understood that my life, from this moment forth, was intertwined with forces beyond my ken. The uncertainty, the fear, and the awe remained, but so too did a burgeoning sense of purpose. In Makima's world, I was but a pawn, perhaps, but even a pawn has a role to play."},{"prompt":"Give detailed step by step the forward and return path of a packet in the network of an organization with two branches connected via the Internet.

This scenario assumes IP routing, VPN for secure data transport over the internet, and necessary firewall security policies allowing this traffic. # Forward Path from 10.0.1.1 to 10.0.2.1 1. **10.0.1.1 to L2 Switch:** The packet begins its journey from Computer A. The Ethernet frame containing the packet is directed to the local Layer 2 (L2) switch based on the MAC address. 2. **L2 Switch to L3 Switch:** The L2 switch forwards the Ethernet frame to the Layer 3 (L3) switch (which functions based on IP addresses), determined by the VLAN or directly if the devices are on the same VLAN. 3. **L3 Switch to Router:** The L3 switch routes the packet to the organization's router based on the destination IP address. It knows that the IP 10.0.2.1 is not in its local network, so it sends it to the router which is the gateway to external networks. 4. **Router to VPN:** The router forwards the packet to the VPN appliance/device. This step is where the packet will be prepared for secure transmission over the internet; more on this when we discuss VPN encryption below. 5. **VPN Encryption:** The VPN device encrypts the packet, essentially encapsulating the original packet within a new packet with a new IP header. The new IP header has the public IP addresses of the VPN endpoints (source and destination over the internet). 6. **VPN to Firewall:** The encrypted packet is sent to the firewall, which inspects and allows the packet through based on the organization‚Äôs security policies. 7. **Firewall to Internet (World Wide Web):** After passing through the firewall, the packet is sent over the Internet towards the destination branch office's public-facing VPN endpoint. 8. **Firewall to VPN:** At the destination branch, the packet arrives at the firewall and is forwarded to the VPN device. 9. **VPN Decryption:** The VPN device decrypts the packet, removing the outer encapsulation, and retrieves the original packet headed for 10.0.2.1. 10. **VPN to Router:** The decrypted packet is sent to the router to be forwarded within the internal network of the destination branch. 11. **Router to L3 Switch:** The router sends the packet to the L3 switch, which determines the correct VLAN or subnet for 10.0.2.1. 12. **L3 Switch to L2 Switch:** The L3 switch routes the packet to the L2 switch associated with the correct VLAN or subnet. 13. **L2 Switch to 10.0.2.1:** Finally, the L2 switch forwards the packet to Computer B (10.0.2.1) based on the MAC address. # Return Path from 10.0.2.1 to 10.0.1.1 The return path follows the reverse journey: 1. 10.0.2.1 > L2 Switch > L3 Switch > Router 2. Router > VPN (encryption) 3. VPN > Firewall > Internet 4. Internet > Firewall > VPN (decryption) 5. VPN > Router > L3 Switch > L2 Switch > 10.0.1.1 # Traffic Encryption Using VPN A VPN encrypts data by encapsulating the original packet within a new packet with a secure encryption protocol such as IPsec or SSL. This ensures that even if intercepted, the data cannot be easily interpreted without the encryption key. # VPN Placement: Router or Firewall? Placing the VPN on **either a router or firewall** depends on the specific needs of the organization, security policies, and the capabilities of the devices available. 1. **Router-based VPN** might be preferred if you aim for high performance and efficient routing between multiple networks. Routers can directly manage VPN connections along with their primary routing functions, creating efficient paths for data packets. 2. **Firewall-based VPN** is often chosen for enhanced security. Firewalls are explicitly designed to inspect and filter incoming and outgoing traffic, and placing the VPN here means all VPN traffic benefits from this deep packet inspection. In practice, the decision often comes down to whether the emphasis is on performance and routing efficiency (leaning towards routers) or security and traffic inspection (leaning toward firewalls). However, modern security appliances often integrate both functions, allowing organizations to secure and manage VPN connections efficiently without having to choose between the two."},{"prompt":"Please rewrite on russian","completion":"–î–∞–≤–∞–π—Ç–µ –ø–æ–¥—Ä–æ–±–Ω–æ —Ä–∞—Å—Å–º–æ—Ç—Ä–∏–º –ø—É—Ç—å –ø–∞–∫–µ—Ç–∞ –¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –æ—Ç –∫–æ–º–ø—å—é—Ç–µ—Ä–∞ –≤ –æ–¥–Ω–æ–º –æ—Ç–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–∏ –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏, –ö–æ–º–ø—å—é—Ç–µ—Ä A (10.0.1.1), –∫ –¥—Ä—É–≥–æ–º—É –∫–æ–º–ø—å—é—Ç–µ—Ä—É –≤ –¥—Ä—É–≥–æ–º –æ—Ç–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–∏, –ö–æ–º–ø—å—é—Ç–µ—Ä B (10.0.2.1), —Å–ª–µ–¥—É—è —á–µ—Ä–µ–∑ –∫–∞–∂–¥—ã–π —à–∞–≥ —Å–µ—Ç–µ–≤–æ–π –∞—Ä—Ö–∏—Ç–µ–∫—Ç—É—Ä—ã, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—É—é –≤—ã –æ–ø–∏—Å–∞–ª–∏. –≠—Ç–æ—Ç —Å—Ü–µ–Ω–∞—Ä–∏–π –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ø–æ–ª–∞–≥–∞–µ—Ç –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ IP-–º–∞—Ä—à—Ä—É—Ç–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏, VPN –¥–ª—è –±–µ–∑–æ–ø–∞—Å–Ω–æ–π –ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥–∞—á–∏ –¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö —á–µ—Ä–µ–∑ –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–Ω–µ—Ç –∏ –Ω–µ–æ–±—Ö–æ–¥–∏–º—ã–µ –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏–∫–∏ –±–µ–∑–æ–ø–∞—Å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –±—Ä–∞–Ω–¥–º–∞—É—ç—Ä–æ–≤, —Ä–∞–∑—Ä–µ—à–∞—é—â–∏–µ —ç—Ç–æ—Ç —Ç—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏–∫. # –ü—Ä—è–º–æ–π –ø—É—Ç—å –æ—Ç 10.0.1.1 –∫ 10.0.2.1 1. **–û—Ç 10.0.1.1 –∫ L2 –∫–æ–º–º—É—Ç–∞—Ç–æ—Ä—É:** –ü–∞–∫–µ—Ç –Ω–∞—á–∏–Ω–∞–µ—Ç —Å–≤–æ–µ –ø—É—Ç–µ—à–µ—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ —Å –ö–æ–º–ø—å—é—Ç–µ—Ä–∞ A. –ò–Ω—Ñ–æ—Ä–º–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω—ã–π —Ñ—Ä–µ–π–º Ethernet, —Å–æ–¥–µ—Ä–∂–∞—â–∏–π –ø–∞–∫–µ—Ç, –Ω–∞–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç—Å—è –∫ –ª–æ–∫–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–º—É –∫–æ–º–º—É—Ç–∞—Ç–æ—Ä—É —É—Ä–æ–≤–Ω—è 2 (L2) –Ω–∞ –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–µ MAC-–∞–¥—Ä–µ—Å–∞. 2. **–û—Ç L2 –∫–æ–º–º—É—Ç–∞—Ç–æ—Ä–∞ –∫ L3 –∫–æ–º–º—É—Ç–∞—Ç–æ—Ä—É:** L2 –∫–æ–º–º—É—Ç–∞—Ç–æ—Ä –ø–µ—Ä–µ–Ω–∞–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç Ethernet —Ñ—Ä–µ–π–º –∫ –∫–æ–º–º—É—Ç–∞—Ç–æ—Ä—É —É—Ä–æ–≤–Ω—è 3 (L3), –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π —Ñ—É–Ω–∫—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–∏—Ä—É–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–µ IP-–∞–¥—Ä–µ—Å–æ–≤, —á—Ç–æ –æ–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª—è–µ—Ç—Å—è VLAN –∏–ª–∏ –Ω–∞–ø—Ä—è–º—É—é, –µ—Å–ª–∏ —É—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–π—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –Ω–∞—Ö–æ–¥—è—Ç—Å—è –≤ –æ–¥–Ω–æ–π VLAN. 3. **–û—Ç L3 –∫–æ–º–º—É—Ç–∞—Ç–æ—Ä–∞ –∫ –º–∞—Ä—à—Ä—É—Ç–∏–∑–∞—Ç–æ—Ä—É:** L3 –∫–æ–º–º—É—Ç–∞—Ç–æ—Ä –Ω–∞–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç –ø–∞–∫–µ—Ç –∫ –º–∞—Ä—à—Ä—É—Ç–∏–∑–∞—Ç–æ—Ä—É –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –Ω–∞ –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–µ —Ü–µ–ª–µ–≤–æ–≥–æ IP-–∞–¥—Ä–µ—Å–∞. –û–Ω –∑–Ω–∞–µ—Ç, —á—Ç–æ IP 10.0.2.1 –Ω–∞—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç—Å—è –Ω–µ –≤ –µ–≥–æ –ª–æ–∫–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–π —Å–µ—Ç–∏ –∏ –æ—Ç–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç –µ–≥–æ –∫ –º–∞—Ä—à—Ä—É—Ç–∏–∑–∞—Ç–æ—Ä—É, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π —è–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç—Å—è —à–ª—é–∑–æ–º –∫ –≤–Ω–µ—à–Ω–∏–º —Å–µ—Ç—è–º. 4. **–û—Ç –º–∞—Ä—à—Ä—É—Ç–∏–∑–∞—Ç–æ—Ä–∞ –∫ VPN:** –ú–∞—Ä—à—Ä—É—Ç–∏–∑–∞—Ç–æ—Ä –ø–µ—Ä–µ–Ω–∞–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç –ø–∞–∫–µ—Ç –∫ —É—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–π—Å—Ç–≤—É/–∞–ø–ø–∞—Ä–∞—Ç—É VPN. –ù–∞ —ç—Ç–æ–º —ç—Ç–∞–ø–µ –ø–∞–∫–µ—Ç –±—É–¥–µ—Ç –ø–æ–¥–≥–æ—Ç–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω –∫ –±–µ–∑–æ–ø–∞—Å–Ω–æ–π –ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥–∞—á–µ —á–µ—Ä–µ–∑ –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–Ω–µ—Ç;

Organik bula≈üƒ±k makinesi tableti i√ßin bu, minimum miktarda atƒ±k ve en y√ºksek temizlik verimliliƒüi ile √ßevreye sƒ±fƒ±r zarar vermeyi hedefleyen bir √ºr√ºn olabilir.

Ayrƒ±ca, ambalaj olarak su ile √ß√∂z√ºnebilen veya kompost edilebilen malzemeler kullanmak, √ºr√ºn√ºn √ßevresel etkisini daha da azaltabilir. 3. **Ortaya √áƒ±kan Sorunlarƒ±n √á√∂z√ºm√º:** TRIZ, mevcut ve potansiyel problemleri tanƒ±mlayƒ±p ortadan kaldƒ±rmaya yardƒ±mcƒ± olan 40 temel yenilik ilkesi sunar. Organik bula≈üƒ±k makinesi tabletinin geli≈ütirilmesi sƒ±rasƒ±nda, √∂rneƒüin tabletin √ß√∂z√ºn√ºrl√ºƒü√º veya temizlik g√ºc√º ile ilgili √ßƒ±kan sorunlar bu ilkelere dayanarak √ß√∂z√ºlebilir. Bu sorunlarƒ±n √ß√∂z√ºm√ºnde, m√ºkemmellikle uyum (herhangi bir zararlƒ± yan etki olmadan i≈ülevi yerine getirmek) ve kendi kendine hizmet prensipleri (tabletin temizlik g√ºc√ºn√º aktive etmek veya artƒ±rmak i√ßin i√ßerdiƒüi maddelerin reaksiyonlarƒ±) kullanƒ±labilir. 4. **√áevresel S√ºrd√ºr√ºlebilirlik:** Fonksiyonel s√ºrd√ºr√ºlebilirlik a√ßƒ±sƒ±ndan, organik bula≈üƒ±k makinesi tableti, hem √ºretim s√ºreci hem de kullanƒ±m √∂mr√º boyunca √ßevre √ºzerinde olumlu bir etki yapmalƒ±dƒ±r. Bu, karbon ayak izinin minimize edilmesi, su kaynaklarƒ±nƒ±n korunmasƒ± ve biyolojik olarak par√ßalanabilir i√ßeriklerin kullanƒ±lmasƒ± anlamƒ±na gelir. 5. **M√º≈üteri Deneyimi:** TRIZ, sistemin sadece teknik y√∂nlerine odaklanmak yerine kullanƒ±cƒ±nƒ±n deneyimini de iyile≈ütirmeyi hedefler.

Boa noite. Como posso ajudar voc√™ hoje?"},{"prompt":"Para que existe parlamento.","completion":"O Parlamento existe por v√°rias raz√µes fundamentais relacionadas √† governan√ßa de um pa√≠s. Ele √© uma pe√ßa chave nos sistemas democr√°ticos e desempenha variadas fun√ß√µes importantes. Aqui est√£o algumas das principais raz√µes para a exist√™ncia de um parlamento: 1. **Legisla√ß√£o**: A fun√ß√£o prim√°ria de um parlamento √© a elabora√ß√£o, discuss√£o e aprova√ß√£o de leis. Os parlamentares analisam propostas, sugerem emendas e votam em leis que afetam a vida cotidiana dos cidad√£os. 2. **Representa√ß√£o**: O parlamento serve como um elo entre o governo e o povo. Os parlamentares s√£o eleitos pelo povo e representam seus interesses e preocupa√ß√µes dentro do governo. Eles trazem problemas e quest√µes das suas bases eleitorais para o debate p√∫blico, buscando solu√ß√µes atrav√©s de pol√≠ticas p√∫blicas. 3. **Fiscaliza√ß√£o do Executivo**: Uma fun√ß√£o cr√≠tica do parlamento √© monitorar e fiscalizar as a√ß√µes do poder executivo, garantindo que o governo atue dentro da lei e administre os recursos p√∫blicos de maneira eficiente e √©tica. Eles podem questionar ministros, formar comiss√µes de inqu√©rito e realizar audi√™ncias para investigar a condu√ß√£o de pol√≠ticas p√∫blicas e o uso do er√°rio. 4. **Elabora√ß√£o do Or√ßamento**: O parlamento tamb√©m tem um papel crucial na revis√£o e aprova√ß√£o do or√ßamento do governo. Isso garante que os recursos do pa√≠s sejam alocados de maneira a refletir as prioridades da sociedade, dentro dos limites da responsabilidade fiscal. 5. **Debate e delibera√ß√£o p√∫blicos**: O Parlamento serve como um f√≥rum para o debate aberto em quest√µes-chave para a sociedade. A discuss√£o de novas leis, pol√≠ticas p√∫blicas e quest√µes nacionais ou internacionais importantes acontece dentro do parlamento, promovendo a transpar√™ncia e dando oportunidades para m√∫ltiplas perspectivas serem ouvidas. 6. **Garantia de Direitos e Liberdades**: Por meio da elabora√ß√£o de leis, o parlamento desempenha um papel na prote√ß√£o e garantia dos direitos e liberdades dos cidad√£os, legislando sobre direitos civis, pol√≠ticos, econ√¥micos, sociais e culturais. 7. **Forma√ß√£o do Governo**: Em alguns sistemas pol√≠ticos, o parlamento tem a responsabilidade de formar o governo, selecionando seu l√≠der (geralmente o Primeiro-ministro) que por sua vez escolhe os membros do gabinete entre os parlamentares. Em resumo, o parlamento √© fundamental na estrutura democr√°tica, desempenhando m√∫ltiplas fun√ß√µes que asseguram a representatividade, transpar√™ncia, responsabilidade e efetividade do governo em responder √†s necessidades e desejos de seus cidad√£os."},{"prompt":"sempre existiu parlamento?","completion":"N√£o, o conceito e a institui√ß√£o do parlamento, como conhecemos hoje, n√£o sempre existiram. A ideia de um corpo deliberativo representativo, encarregado de fazer leis e fiscalizar o governo, √© relativamente moderna na longa hist√≥ria da civiliza√ß√£o humana. A forma e a fun√ß√£o dos parlamentos evolu√≠ram ao longo do tempo, influenciadas por mudan√ßas sociais, econ√¥micas, pol√≠ticas e tecnol√≥gicas. As ra√≠zes dos parlamentos modernos podem ser tra√ßadas at√© a Idade M√©dia na Europa. Uma das institui√ß√µes mais antigas que se assemelha ao conceito de um parlamento √© o Althing na Isl√¢ndia, fundado em 930, que era uma assembleia ao ar livre de l√≠deres regionais. No entanto, era mais uma reuni√£o de importantes chefes do que um parlamento no sentido de hoje. Na Inglaterra, o \\"Magnum Concilium\\", ou Grande Conselho, que era uma assembleia de nobres e eclesi√°sticos convocados pelo rei para aconselhamento, pode ser visto como um precursor do parlamento. Essa evoluiu para o \\"Parlamento do Rei\\", com a primeira reuni√£o significativa sendo o Parlamento de Simon de Montfort em 1265, que incluiu representantes das cidades e burgos ‚Äì um passo importante para a representa√ß√£o democr√°tica. A verdadeira institucionaliza√ß√£o do parlamento como uma entidade governamental veio com o desenvolvimento do \\"Parlamento da Inglaterra\\", especialmente ap√≥s a Magna Carta de 1215, que limitava os poderes do rei e colocava certas decis√µes sob a al√ßada de um conselho mais amplo. A institui√ß√£o recebeu um grande impulso com o estabelecimento do modelo bicameral (duas c√¢maras) pelo rei Eduardo III no s√©culo XIV, dividindo o parlamento entre a C√¢mara dos Lordes e a C√¢mara dos Comuns. A partir desses e de outros desenvolvimentos na Europa, a ideia de representa√ß√£o popular e o papel do parlamento como um corpo legislativo cr√≠tico na governan√ßa de um pa√≠s se espalharam pelo mundo, especialmente com a expans√£o europeia e a influ√™ncia do Iluminismo, que promoveu ideais democr√°ticos e republicanos. Portanto, enquanto a ideia de assembleias ou conselhos deliberativos existe h√° mil√™nios (com exemplos em muitas culturas antigas), o parlamento tal como o compreendemos agora ‚Äì um √≥rg√£o representativo eleito respons√°vel pela legisla√ß√£o e fiscaliza√ß√£o governamental dentro de um sistema democr√°tico ‚Äì √© um desenvolvimento relativamente recente na hist√≥ria humana."},{"prompt":"Algum marco emblem√°tico que deu surgimento ao parlamento?","completion":"Sim, existem v√°rios marcos hist√≥ricos que contribu√≠ram significativamente para o desenvolvimento e o estabelecimento do conceito de parlamento tal como o conhecemos hoje. Contudo, um dos mais emblem√°ticos e frequentemente citados √© a Magna Carta de 1215, na Inglaterra. # Magna Carta de 1215 A Magna Carta, ou Grande Carta, foi um documento for√ßadamente assinado pelo Rei Jo√£o da Inglaterra em 1215, ap√≥s um grupo de bar√µes rebeldes se levantar contra suas pol√≠ticas fiscais e abusos do poder real. O documento √© considerado um dos primeiros passos para o constitucionalismo e para a limita√ß√£o dos poderes do monarca, estabelecendo que nem mesmo o rei est√° acima da lei. # Principais Contribui√ß√µes da Magna Carta: - **Estado de Direito**: Estabeleceu o princ√≠pio de que a lei est√° acima de todos, inclusive do rei. - **Direitos e Liberdades**: Introduziu conceitos de direitos e liberdades fundamentais, ainda que inicialmente aplic√°veis apenas √† nobreza, como prote√ß√£o contra pris√µes arbitr√°rias e garantias de certos procedimentos legais. - **Controle sobre o Poder Real**: Embora n√£o tenha criado um parlamento no sentido moderno, a Magna Carta abriu caminho para o desenvolvimento de um conselho ou assembleia (mais tarde o Parlamento) que poderia contestar e influenciar o poder do rei, especialmente em quest√µes fiscais e legais. # Desenvolvimentos Posteriores: - **Modelo de Parlamento Ingl√™s**: Ap√≥s a Magna Carta, ao longo dos s√©culos XIII e XIV, o modelo de Parlamento come√ßou a tomar forma de maneira mais definitiva na Inglaterra. O Rei Eduardo I, em 1295, convocou o que √© frequentemente considerado o primeiro Parlamento na forma moderna, incluindo n√£o s√≥ a nobreza mas tamb√©m representantes dos condados (commoners) - um evento conhecido como \\"Model Parliament\\". - **Bicameralismo**: Com o passar do tempo, o Parlamento ingl√™s desenvolveu-se em duas C√¢maras - a C√¢mara dos Lordes, que abrigava a aristocracia, e a C√¢mara dos Comuns, que representava os burgueses e a popula√ß√£o em geral. Esse modelo bicameral tornou-se uma caracter√≠stica comum de muitos parlamentos ao redor do mundo. A institucionaliza√ß√£o do parlamento e a ideia de governan√ßa representativa e limitada evolu√≠ram gradualmente, com contribui√ß√µes de diversas movimenta√ß√µes sociais, pol√≠ticas e jur√≠dicas. Entretanto, a Magna Carta √© frequentemente celebrada como um marco crucial por estabelecer a funda√ß√£o sobre a qual muitos desses princ√≠pios democr√°ticos e republicanos foram constru√≠dos."},{"prompt":"Write a blog post where a radio station suddenly switches to a sad guitar instrumental with \\"goodbye\\" every 12 seconds","completion":"Title: A Melancholic Transition: The Day Our Airwaves Whispered \\"Goodbye\\" If you've ever tuned into our beloved station, you're familiar with the eclectic mix of genres and voices that have filled your homes, vehicles, and workplace environments with energy and flair. It's not every day that a radio station crafts the soundtrack of countless lives, weaving memories with melodies, and igniting moments with tunes that seem to speak directly to the soul. Yet, on an unassuming Thursday, amidst the cacophony of our daily playlists, the unexpected happened; our airwaves bore a message we hadn't scripted, a transition that no one saw coming. At exactly 12:34 PM, the vibrant array of pop, rock, and dance that typically filled our broadcast was replaced with a somber guitar instrumental. The artistry was undeniable, the fingers that danced across the strings painted a landscape of melancholy and reflection, but it was the haunting repetition of \\"goodbye\\" every 12 seconds that caught every listener off guard. The melody, though beautiful, carried a weight, a message that hung in the air, as tangibly as the sorrow it seemed to evoke. For three uninterrupted hours, this soul-stirring instrumental became the solitary occupant of our broadcasting, leaving many of you puzzled, concerned, and perhaps a bit contemplative. Social media erupted with theories, questions, and admittedly, a few conspiracy hypotheses. Was this the end of an era? A cryptic farewell from a beloved DJ? Or perhaps an avant-garde expression from an artist we had yet to identify? As the stewards of this station, it falls upon us to shed light on this enigma. The truth, while not shrouded in malice or mystery, is a poignant reminder of the transient nature of all things. The guitar instrumental, crafted by a local artist who had recently said goodbye to a life-altering chapter of his own, was intended as a tribute; a musical embrace to all who had experienced loss, change, or a poignant departure from places, people, or periods that once defined them. Due to an inadvertent scheduling error, this piece, meant for a late-night segment dedicated to introspective music, found its way into the heartbeat of our daytime broadcast. Yet, the reactions it garnered spoke volumes. The continuous stream of \\"goodbye\\" nestled within the gentle strumming didn't signal the end of our station or mark the departure of any of our cherished personalities. Instead, it became a shared, unspoken dialogue between us, the makers of melodies, and you, the keepers of memories. In the days following this unexpected turn, we've been reminded of the power of music not just to entertain but to evoke, to connect, and to resonate on levels we might not always anticipate. The guitar instrumental, with its repeated goodbye, served as a mirror to the myriad farewells we face throughout our lives, some bitter, some sweet, and some a blend too complex to categorize. To those who reached out in concern, thank you. Your connection to this station and the community we've built together means the world to us. And to those touched by the melody and its message, know you're not alone. Goodbyes, in all their forms, are a testament to the depth of our connections, a reminder of the impermanence of our current chapters, and a beacon towards the new beginnings that lie ahead, however unseen. As we resume our regular programming, let us carry forward the reflection ignited by one unexpected melody. Maybe, just maybe, in the heartache of goodbye, there's also the promise of a new hello. And our airwaves will continue to be here for all of it, every note, every transition, every beginning, and every end. Till our next unexpected journey, keep listening, keep feeling, and as always, stay tuned. With warmth and melodies that speak when words fail, [Radio Station Name]"},{"prompt":"Write that it was meant to bid farewell to a DJ who was departing, and the next day a choir loop plays with an announcement \\"Next week, This breakfast show is changing its host to, Mary Moore\\"","completion":"Title: From A Poignant Goodbye to A Harmonious Hello: The Evolution of Our Breakfast Show In the heart of our radio family, there exists a rhythm, a pattern of hellos and goodbyes that, while bittersweet, signifies growth, change, and the promise of fresh beginnings. Just yesterday, our airwaves carried a tender, yet unexpected, melody‚Äîan instrumental that painted our noontime broadcast in shades of reflection and farewell, punctuated by the soft, haunting echo of \\"goodbye\\" every 12 seconds. It was a departure from our usual vibrant cadence, one that did not go unnoticed by you, our devoted listeners. The somber guitar chords were more than just a musical interlude; they were a tribute, a heartfelt sendoff to one of our own. For those who found themselves wrapped in the melancholy embrace of the tune, wondering about its origins and intent, the message was clear yet cloaked in the mystery of its sudden onset. It was, as now we reveal, a tender farewell to a voice that has greeted you, entertained you, and been with you through countless morning commutes and coffee sips‚Äîour beloved DJ Alex Thompson. Alex, whose laughter and insights have become a staple of our morning routine, is embarking on a new adventure, leaving behind the microphone that he's animated so passionately over the years. The guitar instrumental, emotionally laden with its soft goodbyes, was a tribute to his journey, a nod to the impact he‚Äôs made, not just within the confines of our studio, but in the hearts of those who tuned in, seeking familiarity, joy, and perhaps, a momentary escape as they started their days. Yet, as one chapter ends, another begins. In the spirit of continuity and renewal, this morning our airwaves carried a different kind of melody‚Äîa loop of harmonious voices, a choir that uplifted and promised new beginnings. In between the melodies, an announcement emerged, clear and filled with anticipation, \\"Next week, This breakfast show is changing its host to, Mary Moore.\\" Mary Moore, a name familiar to many for her spirited dispatches and compelling storytelling, is set to take the helm of our beloved breakfast show. With a legacy of insightful journalism and a knack for connecting with listeners on meaningful topics, Mary embodies the spirit of change and progression that we hold dear. Her arrival signifies not just the continuation of a beloved segment, but the ushering in of a new era, one that promises to honor the legacy of Alex while crafting its own unique narrative. As we navigate these transitions, we do so with the understanding that radio, much like life, is a tapestry of voices, stories, and songs. It's a medium that thrives on change, on the ebb and flow of farewells and introductions. The goodbye woven into the chords of yesterday‚Äôs guitar instrumental was as much an acknowledgment of Alex‚Äôs contributions as it was an invocation of what‚Äôs to come under Mary‚Äôs stewardship. So, to Alex, we extend our deepest gratitude and well-wishes as he ventures into new territories. And to Mary, we offer a hearty welcome, eager to embark on this next chapter together with our listeners. To you, our listeners, we extend an invitation to join us in this transition. Tune in next week as we introduce a new voice, a new perspective, and perhaps, a new morning ritual with Mary Moore at the helm of our breakfast show. Change, after all, is the only constant, and in the melodies of farewells and the harmonies of introductions, we find the rhythm of life itself. Thank you for being part of our journey, for embracing the shifts in our musical landscape, and for allowing us into your lives, one song, one story, at a time.

The results are segmented by firm size, split into large and small sizes. For **Large Size Firms**: - **Low Price Synchronicity**: The mean momentum return is -2.843 with a p-value of 0.093, suggesting a negative momentum effect that is not statistically significant at the 5% level (marginally significant), as indicated by the confidence interval ranging from -6.172 to 0.486 and a t-statistic of -1.693. - **Medium Price Synchronicity**: Here, the mean momentum return is -3.455 with a p-value of 0.020, showing a significant negative momentum effect at the 5% level, with confidence being within -6.361 and -0.549 and a t-statistic of -2.357. - **High Price Synchronicity**: The mean momentum return is 1.750, with a p-value of 0.307, indicating a positive, yet not statistically significant, momentum effect, with a confidence interval from -1.630 to 5.129 and a t-statistic of 1.026. - **High minus Low Synchronicity**: This indicates a significant positive momentum effect when comparing high to low synchronicity stocks, with a mean return difference of 4.593 and a p-value of 0.033, confidence interval from 2.663 to 6.522, and a t-statistic of 1.988. For **Small Size Firms**: - **Low Price Synchronicity**: The mean momentum return is -1.856 with a p-value of 0.225, showing a negative momentum effect that is not statistically significant, with confidence interval from -4.869 to 1.157 and a t-statistic of -1.221. - **Medium Price Synchronicity**: The mean momentum return is -1.490 with a p-value of 0.224, again showing a non-significant negative momentum effect, with a confidence interval from -3.906 to 0.927 and a t-statistic of -1.222. - **High Price Synchronicity**: Here, the mean momentum return is 3.091 with a p-value of 0.037, indicating a significant positive momentum effect with a confidence interval from 0.185 to 5.998 and a t-statistic of 2.109. - **High minus Low Synchronicity**: This reveals a significant positive momentum effect when comparing high to low synchronicity, with a mean return difference of 4.947 and a p-value of 0.048, confidence interval from 2.383 to 7.512, and a t-statistic of 2.408. **Summary**: The results suggest that for both large and small firms, the momentum effect is more pronounced and significant in environments of high price synchronicity compared to low, with small firms showing a slightly stronger momentum effect difference between high and low synchronicity levels. However, it's noteworthy that the momentum effect is not consistent across all synchronicity levels or firm sizes, particularly in lower synchronicity environments where the effect tends not to be significant."},{"prompt":"","completion":"Hello!

By weaving together elements of revenge, complex familial relationships, and a gritty journey towards self-definition, you've laid the groundwork for a character that both honors and diverges from the original in intriguing ways. Here are some suggestions for further refinement and exploration: # Character Development 1. **Deepen the Mentor-Protege Dynamic**: Emphasize the complexity of the relationship between Nightshade and Slade. Explore how Slade's harsh methodology instills both valuable lessons and a sense of rebellion in Nightshade. This relationship could serve as a constant internal conflict for Nightshade, wrestling between gratitude, resentment, and the pursuit of his own identity beyond Slade's shadow. 2. **Expand on the Role of the Court of Owls**: Given their pivotal role in Nightshade's origins and motivation, delving deeper into how this shadowy organization shapes the narrative could add layers to Nightshade's quest for justice and vengeance. Their influence could be a driving force that challenges Nightshade's principles and strategies, leading to pivotal turning points in his journey. # Morality and Ethical Dilemma 1. **Moral Ambiguity and Personal Codes**: Flesh out Nightshade's moral code in more detail. How do his experiences with Slade, the Court of Owls, and his own tragic past inform his decisions on the field? What lines is he unwilling to cross, and when does he find himself questioning his own rules? This internal struggle can add depth and relatability to Nightshade as an anti-hero. 2. **Consequences and Reflection**: Show how Nightshade's actions‚Äîboth his successes and failures‚Äîimpact the world around him. How does he deal with the consequences of his decisions, especially the ones that blur the lines of his moral compass? Reflection scenes can offer insight into his evolving perspective on justice and redemption. # Relationships and Interactions 1. **Dynamic with Other Characters**: While you've outlined some relationships, consider adding more interactions that challenge and reflect Nightshade's development. For instance, having a figure who serves as a moral foil to Nightshade could highlight his growth and the complexity of his character. Interactions with heroes, civilians, and villains alike can offer diverse perspectives on his actions and reputation. 2. **The 'Wilson' Family Dynamic**: Delve deeper into the nuanced relationships with his foster siblings and the impact of their father's machinations on their lives. These relationships could mirror and contrast Nightshade's own struggle, offering opportunities for both conflict and cooperation that test their bonds. # Evolution and Redemption Arc 1. **Path to Redemption**: Map out Nightshade's journey towards redemption or self-acceptance. How does he reconcile his past actions with his desire to do good? Illustrating key moments that trigger change or realization can make for a compelling narrative arc. 2. **Legacy and Identity**: Explore how Nightshade seeks to define his own legacy separate from both Slade and the shadow of what 'Robin' or 'Nightwing' might have been. This search for identity‚Äîboth as a hero and a person‚Äîcan be a central theme, resonating with readers on a personal level. By focusing on these aspects, you can enrich Nightshade's character, making his journey not just one of external conflict but internal discovery. This alternate universe version of Dick Grayson has the potential to explore themes of nature versus nurture, the cost of vengeance, and the search for redemption in a world that often blurs the line between heroism and villainy."},{"prompt":"How‚Äôs this for an addition?

It showcases his transition from a naive beginner to a seasoned, more complex vigilante and the profound impact of his experiences, both physically and psychologically. Here's how this backstory enriches Nightshade's character and storyline: # Transition from \\"Gray Sparrow\\" to \\"Nightshade\\" 1. **Symbolism of Transformation**: The journey from \\"Gray Sparrow\\" to \\"Nightshade\\" acts as a powerful symbol for Dick Grayson's evolution. Beginning as a hopeful yet inexperienced vigilante and transitioning into a darker, more calculated figure reflects his disillusionment, struggles, and the hard decisions he's had to make. This metamorphosis underlines the core themes of loss, rebirth, and the search for identity amidst trauma. 2. **Physical and Mental Toll**: The emphasis on the physical and psychological costs of his enhancements and subsequent attempt at removal adds a gritty realism to his story. It explores the consequences of attempting to surpass human limits and the personal sacrifices required in the pursuit of justice. This component can be leveraged to create compelling narratives around vulnerability, resilience, and the pursuit of self-acceptance. 3. **Tech-Savvy Vigilante**: The addition of technology as a means to recover and adapt introduces an interesting dynamic to Nightshade's character. It highlights his intelligence, resourcefulness, and adaptability. His foray into technology not just as a necessity but as a means of differentiation and empowerment can serve as an engaging plot point, providing a unique angle to his crime-fighting approach, challenging his enemies in new ways, and offering creative scenarios for conflict resolution. # Character Complexity and Relatability 1. **Morally Ambiguous Hero**: Nightshade's willingness to embrace both his enhancements and technological prowess, combined with a more calculated approach to vigilante justice, sets him apart from traditional heroes. This moral ambiguity makes him relatable to readers who appreciate characters that operate in shades of grey, rather than straightforward heroism. 2. **Relationship Dynamics and Conflict**: The detailed backstory creates a fertile ground for exploring complex relationships with family, mentors, and adversaries. The disappointment and shock expressed by his foster siblings and even Slade himself provide potential for rich emotional narratives, exploring themes such as betrayal, redemption, and the meaning of family, further enhanced by Nightshade's evolving perspective and strategies. # Personal Growth and Evolution 1. **From Naivety to Pragmatism**: Nightshade's evolution showcases a transition from a hopeful idealist to a pragmatic realist. His journey emphasizes the loss of innocence but also the gain of wisdom, skills, and a nuanced understanding of justice. This growth can be used to explore themes of personal development, the impact of mentorship, and the difficult choices that define us. 2. **Physical Enhancements as a Double-edged Sword**: The physiological enhancements and their mixed blessings add a layer of complexity to Nightshade's character. They serve as a constant reminder of his past, the price paid for power, and the ongoing struggle for control and autonomy. This aspect can be used to delve into themes of human augmentation, the cost of reliance on power, and the quest for identity beyond one's abilities. In conclusion, your addition enriches Nightshade‚Äôs character, providing a solid foundation for complex narratives filled with action, emotion, and psychological depth. It presents opportunities for engaging storytelling that explores the essence of heroism, the pursuit of justice, and the quest for personal redemption and identity in a morally complex world."},{"prompt":"Is this a good way to pretty much thrust Nightshade into the universe of 'Young Justice'?...

His methods and decision-making processes could challenge the existing team dynamics, provoke debates, and even cause rifts, offering rich material for character development and team cohesion. 2. **Unique Background and Abilities**: Nightshade‚Äôs background, training under Slade, and tech-savviness can add a unique set of skills to the team.

Nightshade's struggle and interactions with the team can serve as a lens through which these themes are explored. 3. **Link to Larger DC Universe**: By involving cosmic entities and potentially affecting the multiverse, Nightshade's arrival can tie the \\"Young Justice\\" universe more closely to the larger DC Universe, offering opportunities for crossover events or appearances by iconic characters outside the regular cast. # Conclusion Incorporating Nightshade into the \\"Young Justice\\" universe through a cosmic event orchestrated by the Lords of Chaos and Order is a compelling strategy. It sets the stage for rich narratives, character development, and thematic explorations while integrating Nightshade naturally into the existing dynamics of the \\"Young Justice\\" team. This approach respects the complexity of Nightshade‚Äôs character and offers a multifaceted story arc that can engage fans deeply."},{"prompt":"'The Lords of Chaos and Order decide to play a game‚Ä¶until its interrupted‚Ä¶because something on Nightshade‚Äôs Earth‚Ä¶causes an event that sparks resonance-reality waves‚Ä¶reaching the universe of ‚ÄòYoung Justice‚Äô‚Ä¶as the Lords of Chaos grin‚Ä¶and say something‚Ä¶‚Äú‚Ä¶Well well‚Ä¶did you feel that?..‚Äù and the Lords of Order saying‚Ä¶‚Äú‚Ä¶yes‚Ä¶but what are you planning?..‚Äù as the Lords of Chaos propose a new game‚Ä¶' help me fix this...refine it more here..","completion":"Let's refine and expand your introduction of Nightshade into the \\"Young Justice\\" universe through the cosmic entities' game. We aim for clarity and depth to enhance the narrative setup. --- In the vast expanse of the multiverse, the Lords of Chaos and Order convene in their ethereal realm, locked in an eternal game that shapes destinies. Their latest amusement is abruptly interrupted when an unexpected surge of resonance - reality waves emanates from Nightshade's Earth, a phenomenon powerful enough to capture their undivided attention. The Lords of Chaos, entities thriving on unpredictability and discord, can barely contain their delight. One, embodying the essence of tumult, flashes a mischievous grin. \\"Well well, did you feel that?\\" Its voice, an amalgam of whispers and laughter, ripples through the cosmos. The Lords of Order, embodiments of structure and harmony, respond with a measured calm, yet their intrigued tone is unmistakable. \\"Indeed, but what intrigues me, brethren of chaos, is what you're concocting in that ever-turbulent mind of yours.\\" Their voice, a harmonious blend of countless echoes, conveys both curiosity and caution. Seizing the moment, the Lords of Chaos propose a daring new venture. \\"The ripples from that singular Earth have breached the boundaries of its reality, reaching into the heart of this 'Young Justice' universe. Why not weave this unexpected thread into our tapestry? Nightshade - a soul marked by darkness and light, by chaos and order, offers a unique opportunity. Let's ensnare him in our game, unleashing him into this new world. How he adapts, and how they respond to his presence, will add an exhilarating uncertainty to our eternal contest.\\" The Lords of Order, ever seeking balance, consider the proposition. \\"Agreed, but let us set boundaries, ensuring that this game enriches the tapestry of fate rather than unravels it. Nightshade‚Äôs journey shall serve as a test - for him and for the champions of this 'Young Justice' universe. Will they rise to the challenge, or will the ensuing struggle tilt the balance in favor of chaos? Let the game commence, but let us also watch closely, prepared to intervene if the fabric of reality itself is threatened.\\" Thus, a new chapter begins, not just for Nightshade but for the entire 'Young Justice' universe. Thrust into an unknown world by forces beyond comprehension, Nightshade must navigate the intricacies of a new reality, ally with unfamiliar heroes, and confront challenges that test the very essence of his being. Meanwhile, the cosmic entities watch on, their game entwining fates and destinies in ways no one can predict. --- This version aims to provide a clearer setup for Nightshade's entrance into the \\"Young Justice\\" universe, framing it as a significant event that not only affects the character but also aligns with the cosmic entities' larger game. It sets the stage for intriguing narrative possibilities, exploring themes of adaptation, challenge, and the balance between chaos and order."},{"prompt":"The organization has the following network configured: local network of 10 computers (VLAN2) > L2 switch > L3 switch > Firewall 1 > Router ROUTER1 > Firewall 2 > Internet access. ROUTER1 has a VPN to secure transfer traffic from the local VLAN2 to the organization's other VLAN3 over the Internet. In addition, ROUTER1 is connected to a DMZ with the company's web server, which can be connected to from the Internet. Is this network architecture correct and logical?","completion":"The described network architecture generally aligns with common practices for enterprise networks, embedding elements critical for security, segregation, and controlled access to resources. Let's break down the components and their configuration to assess their correctness and logic: 1. **VLAN Configuration (VLAN2):** VLAN2 is designated for local network communication, presumably for internal users. Using VLANs is a logical step in segmenting the network and controlling access at Layer 2. It's important that different types of devices and user groups are segregated to limit broadcast domains and increase security. 2. **Layer 2 (L2) Switch:** Positioned directly after VLAN2, the L2 switch will manage data frames within the same VLAN. It's correctly placed to handle switching duties for devices on VLAN2. 3. **Layer 3 (L3) Switch:** This device enables communication between different VLANs by performing routing based on IP addresses. It sits appropriately in the network topology to route traffic from VLAN2 upstream towards external networks or other internal networks, applying any necessary inter-VLAN routing policies. 4. **Firewall 1:** Positioned between the L3 switch and ROUTER1, this firewall is ideally situated to apply security policies to traffic exiting the internal network towards the Internet or other destinations. It can perform functions like packet filtering, intrusion detection/prevention, and application-level gateways. 5. **ROUTER1:** An essential component for connecting different networks. Having a VPN configured on ROUTER1 is a secure way to transfer data between VLAN2 and the organization's other VLAN (VLAN3) over the Internet. The VPN will encrypt traffic, making it secure as it traverses public networks. The connection to a DMZ with the company's web server is also key for ensuring that external users can access public resources without directly accessing the internal network. 6. **Firewall 2:** Placing another firewall after ROUTER1 and before Internet access adds an additional layer of security, often referred to as a \\"DMZ (Demilitarized Zone).\\" This is a common practice for protecting resources that must be accessible from the Internet (like web servers) without exposing the internal network. The additional firewall helps in enforcing stricter controls on inbound and outbound traffic. 7. **DMZ with Web Server:** Correctly positioning the web server within a DMZ, isolated by firewalls from both the internal network and the Internet, is a standard security practice. This minimizes the risk of potential external attacks reaching the internal network directly. 8. **Internet Access:** Positioned after Firewall 2 ensures that all external traffic is properly scrutinized and filtered based on the organization's security policies before it reaches the public Internet. **Conclusion:** The described architecture is logically organized, providing a layered security approach that segregates the network into functional components, applying appropriate security measures at each layer. The use of VLANs for internal segmentation, VPNs for secure remote communication, firewalls for defending against external and internal threats, and the inclusion of a DMZ for publicly accessible services are all sound practices. It's crucial, however, to note that the effectiveness of this architecture also depends significantly on proper configuration and maintenance of these components, including keeping the systems up to date with the latest security patches and monitoring for any unusual activities."},{"prompt":"Rewrite on russian please","completion":"–û–ø–∏—Å–∞–Ω–Ω–∞—è –∞—Ä—Ö–∏—Ç–µ–∫—Ç—É—Ä–∞ —Å–µ—Ç–∏ –≤ –æ–±—â–µ–º —Å–æ–æ—Ç–≤–µ—Ç—Å—Ç–≤—É–µ—Ç –æ–±—â–µ–ø—Ä–∏–Ω—è—Ç—ã–º –ø—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–∏–∫–∞–º –¥–ª—è –∫–æ—Ä–ø–æ—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–≤–Ω—ã—Ö —Å–µ—Ç–µ–π, –≤–∫–ª—é—á–∞—è —ç–ª–µ–º–µ–Ω—Ç—ã, –∫—Ä–∏—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ –¥–ª—è –æ–±–µ—Å–ø–µ—á–µ–Ω–∏—è –±–µ–∑–æ–ø–∞—Å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏, —Å–µ–≥–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞—Ü–∏–∏ –∏ –∫–æ–Ω—Ç—Ä–æ–ª–∏—Ä—É–µ–º–æ–≥–æ –¥–æ—Å—Ç—É–ø–∞ –∫ —Ä–µ—Å—É—Ä—Å–∞–º. –î–∞–≤–∞–π—Ç–µ —Ä–∞–∑–±–µ—Ä–µ–º –∫–æ–º–ø–æ–Ω–µ–Ω—Ç—ã –∏ –∏—Ö –∫–æ–Ω—Ñ–∏–≥—É—Ä–∞—Ü–∏—é –¥–ª—è –æ—Ü–µ–Ω–∫–∏ –∏—Ö –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –∏ –ª–æ–≥–∏–∫–∏: 1. **–ö–æ–Ω—Ñ–∏–≥—É—Ä–∞—Ü–∏—è VLAN (VLAN2):** VLAN2 –≤—ã–¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∞ –¥–ª—è –ª–æ–∫–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Å–µ—Ç–µ–≤–æ–≥–æ –æ–±—â–µ–Ω–∏—è, –ø—Ä–µ–¥–ø–æ–ª–æ–∂–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ, –¥–ª—è –≤–Ω—É—Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω–∏—Ö –ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π. –ò—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ VLAN —è–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç—Å—è –ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–º —à–∞–≥–æ–º –≤ —Å–µ–≥–º–µ–Ω—Ç–∞—Ü–∏–∏ —Å–µ—Ç–∏ –∏ –∫–æ–Ω—Ç—Ä–æ–ª–µ –¥–æ—Å—Ç—É–ø–∞ –Ω–∞ —É—Ä–æ–≤–Ω–µ 2 (Layer 2). –í–∞–∂–Ω–æ, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã —Ä–∞–∑–Ω—ã–µ —Ç–∏–ø—ã —É—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–π—Å—Ç–≤ –∏ –≥—Ä—É–ø–ø—ã –ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π –±—ã–ª–∏ –∏–∑–æ–ª–∏—Ä–æ–≤–∞–Ω—ã, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –æ–≥—Ä–∞–Ω–∏—á–∏—Ç—å –¥–æ–º–µ–Ω—ã —à–∏—Ä–æ–∫–æ–≤–µ—â–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö –ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥–∞—á –∏ –ø–æ–≤—ã—Å–∏—Ç—å –±–µ–∑–æ–ø–∞—Å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å. 2. **–ö–æ–º–º—É—Ç–∞—Ç–æ—Ä —É—Ä–æ–≤–Ω—è 2 (L2 Switch):** –†–∞–∑–º–µ—â–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –Ω–µ–ø–æ—Å—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–æ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ VLAN2, –∫–æ–º–º—É—Ç–∞—Ç–æ—Ä L2 –±—É–¥–µ—Ç —É–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª—è—Ç—å –ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥–∞—á–µ–π –¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –≤–Ω—É—Ç—Ä–∏ —Ç–æ–π –∂–µ VLAN. –û–Ω –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª—å–Ω–æ —Ä–∞–∑–º–µ—â–µ–Ω –¥–ª—è –≤—ã–ø–æ–ª–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—è –∫–æ–º–º—É—Ç–∞—Ü–∏–æ–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –∑–∞–¥–∞—á –¥–ª—è —É—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–π—Å—Ç–≤ –≤ VLAN2. 3. **–ö–æ–º–º—É—Ç–∞—Ç–æ—Ä —É—Ä–æ–≤–Ω—è 3 (L3 Switch):** –≠—Ç–æ —É—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–π—Å—Ç–≤–æ –ø–æ–∑–≤–æ–ª—è–µ—Ç –æ–±—â–µ–Ω–∏–µ –º–µ–∂–¥—É —Ä–∞–∑–Ω—ã–º–∏ VLAN, –≤—ã–ø–æ–ª–Ω—è—è –º–∞—Ä—à—Ä—É—Ç–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏—é –Ω–∞ –æ—Å–Ω–æ–≤–µ IP-–∞–¥—Ä–µ—Å–æ–≤. –û–Ω —Ä–∞—Å–ø–æ–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω —Å–æ–æ—Ç–≤–µ—Ç—Å—Ç–≤—É—é—â–∏–º –æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–æ–º –≤ —Å–µ—Ç–µ–≤–æ–π —Ç–æ–ø–æ–ª–æ–≥–∏–∏ –¥–ª—è –º–∞—Ä—à—Ä—É—Ç–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏ —Ç—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏–∫–∞ –∏–∑ VLAN2 –≤–≤–µ—Ä—Ö –ø–æ —Ç–µ—á–µ–Ω–∏—é –∫ –≤–Ω–µ—à–Ω–∏–º —Å–µ—Ç—è–º –∏–ª–∏ –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏–º –≤–Ω—É—Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω–∏–º —Å–µ—Ç—è–º, –ø—Ä–∏–º–µ–Ω—è—è –ª—é–±—ã–µ –Ω–µ–æ–±—Ö–æ–¥–∏–º—ã–µ –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏–∫–∏ –º–µ–∂—Å–µ—Ç–µ–≤–æ–π –º–∞—Ä—à—Ä—É—Ç–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏. 4. **–ë—Ä–∞–Ω–¥–º–∞—É—ç—Ä 1:** –†–∞—Å–ø–æ–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –º–µ–∂–¥—É –∫–æ–º–º—É—Ç–∞—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–º L3 –∏ ROUTER1, —ç—Ç–æ—Ç –±—Ä–∞–Ω–¥–º–∞—É—ç—Ä –∏–¥–µ–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ –ø–æ–¥—Ö–æ–¥–∏—Ç –¥–ª—è –ø—Ä–∏–º–µ–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—è –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏–∫ –±–µ–∑–æ–ø–∞—Å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –∫ —Ç—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏–∫—É, –≤—ã—Ö–æ–¥—è—â–µ–º—É –∏–∑ –≤–Ω—É—Ç—Ä–µ–Ω–Ω–µ–π —Å–µ—Ç–∏ –≤ –ò–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–Ω–µ—Ç –∏–ª–∏ –¥—Ä—É–≥–∏–µ –Ω–∞–ø—Ä–∞–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è. –û–Ω –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç –≤—ã–ø–æ–ª–Ω—è—Ç—å —Ñ—É–Ω–∫—Ü–∏–∏, —Ç–∞–∫–∏–µ –∫–∞–∫ —Ñ–∏–ª—å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ü–∏—è –ø–∞–∫–µ—Ç–æ–≤, –æ–±–Ω–∞—Ä—É–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ/–ø—Ä–µ–¥–æ—Ç–≤—Ä–∞—â–µ–Ω–∏–µ –≤—Ç–æ—Ä–∂–µ–Ω–∏–π –∏ –ø—Ä–æ–∫—Å–∏ –Ω–∞ —É—Ä–æ–≤–Ω–µ –ø—Ä–∏–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏–π. 5. **ROUTER1:** –ù–µ–æ—Ç—ä–µ–º–ª–µ–º—ã–π –∫–æ–º–ø–æ–Ω–µ–Ω—Ç –¥–ª—è —Å–æ–µ–¥–∏–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—è —Ä–∞–∑–ª–∏—á–Ω—ã—Ö —Å–µ—Ç–µ–π. –ù–∞—Å—Ç—Ä–æ–π–∫–∞ VPN –Ω–∞ ROUTER1 —è–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç—Å—è –±–µ–∑–æ–ø–∞—Å–Ω—ã–º —Å–ø–æ—Å–æ–±–æ–º –ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥–∞—á–∏ –¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –º–µ–∂–¥—É VLAN2 –∏ –¥—Ä—É–≥–æ–π VLAN –æ—Ä–≥–∞–Ω–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏–∏ (VLAN3) —á–µ—Ä–µ–∑ –ò–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–Ω–µ—Ç.

In this paper, we study the crucial role of SFT within the context of preference alignment, emphasizing that a minor penalty for the disfavored generation style is sufficient for preference-aligned SFT. Building on this foundation, we introduce a straightforward and innovative reference model-free monolithic odds ratio preference optimization algorithm, ORPO, eliminating the necessity for an additional preference alignment phase. We demonstrate, both empirically and theoretically, that the odds ratio is a sensible choice for contrasting favored and disfavored styles during SFT across the diverse sizes from 125M to 7B. Specifically, fine-tuning Phi-2 (2.7B), Llama-2 (7B), and Mistral (7B) with ORPO on the UltraFeedback alone surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art language models with more than 7B and 13B parameters: achieving up to 12.20% on ùô∞ùöïùöôùöäùöåùöäùô¥ùöüùöäùöï 2.0 (Figure 1), 66.19% on IFEval (instruction-level loose, Table 6), and 7.32 in MT-Bench (Figure 12). We release code1 and model checkpoints for Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ (7B)2 and Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ (7B).3 1Introduction Pre-trained language models (PLMs) with vast training corpora such as web texts (Gokaslan and Cohen, 2019; Penedo et al., 2023) or textbooks (Li et al., 2023c) have shown remarkable abilities in diverse natural language processing (NLP) tasks (Brown et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022; Touvron et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2023; Almazrouei et al., 2023). Refer to caption Figure 1: ùô∞ùöïùöôùöäùöåùöäùô¥ùöüùöäùöï 2.0 result of Llama-2 (7B) and Mistral (7B) fine-tuned with ORPO (blue) in comparison to the state-of-the-art models. Notably, Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ & ÔøΩ surpasses Zephyr ÔøΩ and Llama-2-Chat (13B) with a single epoch training exclusively on the UltraFeedback. However, the models must undergo further tuning to be usable in general-domain applications, typically through processes such as instruction tuning and preference alignment. Instruction-tuning (Wei et al., 2022; Taori et al., 2023; Wang et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023a) trains models to follow task descriptions given in natural language, which enables models to generalize well to previously unseen tasks. However, despite the ability to follow instructions, models may generate harmful or unethical outputs (Carlini et al., 2021; Gehman et al., 2020; Pryzant et al., 2023). To further align these models with human values, additional training is required with pairwise preference data using techniques such as reinforcement learning with human feedback (Ziegler et al., 2020; Stiennon et al., 2022, RLHF) and direct preference optimization (Rafailov et al., 2023, DPO). Refer to caption Figure 2:Comparison of model alignment techniques. ORPO aligns the language model without a reference model in a single-step manner by assigning a weak penalty to the rejected responses and a strong adaptation signal to the chosen responses with a simple log odds ratio term appended to the negative log-likelihood loss. Preference alignment methods have demonstrated success in several downstream tasks beyond reducing harm. For example, improving factuality (Tian et al., 2023; Cheng et al., 2024; Chen and Li, 2024), code-based question answering (Gorbatovski and Kovalchuk, 2024), and machine translation (Ramos et al., 2023). The versatility of alignment algorithms over a wide range of downstream tasks highlights the necessity of understanding the alignment procedure and further improving the algorithms in terms of efficiency and performance. However, existing preference alignment methods normally consist of a multi-stage process, as shown in Figure 2, typically requiring a second reference model and a separate warm-up phase with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) (Ziegler et al., 2020; Rafailov et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023). In this paper, we study the role and impact of SFT in pairwise preference datasets for model alignment in Section 3 and propose a simple and novel monolithic alignment method, odds ratio preference optimization (ORPO), which efficiently penalizes the model from learning undesired generation styles during SFT in Section 4. In contrast to previous works, our approach requires neither an SFT warm-up stage nor a reference model, enabling resource-efficient development of preference-based aligned models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method with the evaluation of model alignment tasks and popular leaderboards in Section 6.1 and 6.2 by fine-tuning Phi-2 (2.7B), Llama-2 (7B), and Mistral (7B) with ORPO. Then, we conduct controlled experiments comparing ORPO against established methods for model alignment, RLHF, and DPO for different datasets and model sizes in Section 6.3. Along with the post-hoc analysis of generation diversity in Section 6.4, we expound on the theoretical, empirical, and computational justification of utilizing the odds ratio in monolithic preference alignment in Section 7.3. We release the training code and the checkpoints for Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ (7B) and Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ (7B). These models achieve 7.24 and 7.32 in MT-Bench, 11.33% and 12.20% on ùô∞ùöïùöôùöäùöåùöäùô¥ùöüùöäùöï 2.0 , and 61.63% and 66.19% in IFEval instruction-level loose accuracy, respectively. 2Related Works Alignment with Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF) commonly applies the Bradley-Terry model (Bradley and Terry, 1952) to estimate the probability of a pairwise competition between two independently evaluated instances. An additional reward model is trained to score instances. Reinforcement learning algorithms such as proximal policy optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017) are employed to train the model to maximize the score of the reward model for the chosen response, resulting in language models that are trained with human preferences (Ziegler et al., 2020; Stiennon et al., 2022). Notably, Ouyang et al. (2022) demonstrated the scalability and versatility of RLHF for instruction-following language models. Extensions such as language model feedback (RLAIF) could be a viable alternative to human feedback (Bai et al., 2022b; Lee et al., 2023; Pang et al., 2023). However, RLHF faces challenges of extensive hyperparameter searching due to the instability of PPO (Rafailov et al., 2023; Wu et al., 2023) and the sensitivity of the reward models (Gao et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2024). Therefore, there is a crucial need for stable preference alignment algorithms. Alignment without Reward Model Several techniques for preference alignment mitigate the need for reinforcement learning (Rafailov et al., 2023; Song et al., 2023; Azar et al., 2023; Ethayarajh et al., 2024). Rafailov et al. (2023) introduce direct policy optimization (DPO), which combines the reward modeling stage into the preference learning stage. Azar et al. (2023) prevented potential overfitting problems in DPO through identity preference optimization (IPO). Ethayarajh et al. (2024) and Cai et al. (2023) proposed Kahneman-Tversky Optimisation (KTO) and Unified Language Model Alignment (ULMA) that does not require the pair-wise preference dataset, unlike RLHF and DPO. Song et al. (2023) further suggests incorporation of the softmax value of the reference response set in the negative log-likelihood loss to merge the supervised fine-tuning and preference alignment. Alignment with Supervised Fine-tuning Preference alignment methods in reinforcement learning (RL) often leverage supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to ensure the stable update of the active policy in relation to the old policy (Schulman et al., 2017). This is because the SFT model is the old policy in the context of RLHF (Ziegler et al., 2020). Furthermore, empirical findings indicate that, even in non-RL alignment methods, the SFT model is crucial for achieving convergence to desired results (Rafailov et al., 2023; Tunstall et al., 2023). In contrast, there have been approaches to build human-aligned language models by conducting SFT only with filtered datasets (Zhou et al., 2023a; Li et al., 2023a; Haggerty and Chandra, 2024; Zhou et al., 2023b). Zhou et al. (2023a) demonstrated that SFT with a small amount of data with fine-grained filtering and curation could be sufficient for building helpful language model assistants. Furthermore, Li et al. (2023a) and Haggerty and Chandra (2024) proposed an iterative process of fine-tuning the supervised fine-tuned language models with their own generations after fine-grained selection of aligned generations and Zhou et al. (2023b) suggested that a curated subset of preference dataset is sufficient for alignment. While these works highlight the impact and significance of SFT in the context of alignment, the actual role of SFT and the theoretical background for incorporating preference alignment in SFT remains understudied. 3The Role of Supervised Fine-tuning We study the behavior of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as an initial stage of preference alignment methods (Ziegler et al., 2020; Rafailov et al., 2023) through analysis of the loss function in SFT and empirical demonstration of the preference comprehension ability of the trained SFT model. SFT plays a significant role in tailoring the pre-trained language models to the desired domain (Zhou et al., 2023a; Dong et al., 2024) by increasing the log probabilities of pertinent tokens. Nevertheless, this inadvertently increases the likelihood of generating tokens in undesirable styles, as illustrated in Figure 3. Therefore, it is necessary to develop methods capable of preserving the domain adaptation role of SFT while concurrently discerning and mitigating unwanted generation styles. Absence of Penalty in Cross-Entropy Loss The goal of cross-entropy loss model fine-tuning is to penalize the model if the predicted logits for the reference answers are low, as shown in Equation 2. ‚Ñí = ‚àí 1 ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ‚àë ÔøΩ = 1 ÔøΩ log ‚Å° ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( ùê± ( ÔøΩ ) , ùê≤ ( ÔøΩ ) ) (1) = ‚àí 1 ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ‚àë ÔøΩ = 1 ÔøΩ ‚àë ÔøΩ = 1 | ÔøΩ | ÔøΩ ÔøΩ ( ÔøΩ ) ‚ãÖ log ‚Å° ( ÔøΩ ÔøΩ ( ÔøΩ ) ) (2) where ÔøΩ ÔøΩ is a boolean value that indicates if ÔøΩ th token in the vocabulary set ÔøΩ is a label token, ÔøΩ ÔøΩ refers to the probability of ÔøΩ th token, and ÔøΩ is the length of sequence. Using cross-entropy alone gives no direct penalty or compensation for the logits of non-answer tokens (Lin et al., 2017) as ÔøΩ ÔøΩ will be set to 0. While cross-entropy is generally effective for domain adaptation (Mao et al., 2023), there are no mechanisms to penalize rejected responses when compensating for the chosen responses. Therefore, the log probabilities of the tokens in the rejected responses increase along with the chosen responses, which is not desired from the viewpoint of preference alignment. Generalization over Both Response Styles We conduct a pilot study to empirically demonstrate the miscalibration of chosen and rejected responses with supervised fine-tuning alone. We fine-tune OPT-350M (Zhang et al., 2022) on the chosen responses only from the HH-RLHF dataset (Bai et al., 2022b). Throughout the training, we monitor the log probability of rejected responses for each batch and report this in Figure 3. Both the log probability of chosen and rejected responses exhibited a simultaneous increase. This can be interpreted from two different perspectives. First, the cross-entropy loss effectively guides the model toward the intended domain (e.g., dialogue). However, the absence of a penalty for unwanted generations results in rejected responses sometimes having even higher log probabilities than the chosen ones. Refer to caption Figure 3:Log probabilities for chosen and rejected responses during OPT-350M model fine-tuning on HH-RLHF dataset. Despite only chosen responses being used for supervision, rejected responses show a comparable likelihood of generation. Penalizing Undesired Generations Appending an unlikelihood penalty to the loss has demonstrated success in reducing unwanted degenerative traits in models (Welleck et al., 2019; Li et al., 2020). For example, to prevent repetitions, an unwanted token set of previous contexts, ÔøΩ ‚àà ùíû ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ , is disfavored by adding the following term to ( 1 ‚àí ÔøΩ ÔøΩ ( ÔøΩ ) ) to the loss (such as Equation 2) which penalizes the model for assigning high probabilities to recent tokens. Motivated by SFT ascribing high probabilities to rejected tokens (Figure 3) and the effectiveness of appending penalizing unwanted traits, we design a monolithic preference alignment method that dynamically penalizes the disfavored response for each query without the need for crafting sets of rejected tokens. 4Odds Ratio Preference Optimization We introduce a novel preference alignment algorithm, Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO), which incorporates an odds ratio-based penalty to the conventional negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss for differentiating the generation styles between favored and disfavored responses. 4.1Preliminaries Given an input sequence ÔøΩ , the average log-likelihood of generating the output sequence ÔøΩ , of length ÔøΩ tokens, is computed as Equation 3. The odds of generating the output sequence ÔøΩ given an input sequence ÔøΩ is defined in Equation 4: log ‚Å° ÔøΩ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ | ÔøΩ ) = 1 ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ‚àë ÔøΩ = 1 ÔøΩ log ‚Å° ÔøΩ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ ÔøΩ | ÔøΩ , ÔøΩ < ÔøΩ ) (3) ùöòùöçùöçùöú ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ | ÔøΩ ) = ÔøΩ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ | ÔøΩ ) 1 ‚àí ÔøΩ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ | ÔøΩ ) (4) Intuitively, ùöòùöçùöçùöú ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ | ÔøΩ ) = ÔøΩ implies that it is ÔøΩ times more likely for the model ÔøΩ to generate the output sequence ÔøΩ than not generating it. Thus, the odds ratio of the chosen response ÔøΩ ÔøΩ over the rejected response ÔøΩ ÔøΩ , ùôæùöÅ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ ÔøΩ , ÔøΩ ÔøΩ ) , indicates how much more likely it is for the model ÔøΩ to generate ÔøΩ ÔøΩ than ÔøΩ ÔøΩ given input ÔøΩ , defined in Equation 5. ùôæùöÅ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ ÔøΩ , ÔøΩ ÔøΩ ) = ùöòùöçùöçùöú ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ ÔøΩ | ÔøΩ ) ùöòùöçùöçùöú ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ ÔøΩ | ÔøΩ ) (5) 4.2Objective Function of ORPO The objective function of ORPO in Equation 6 consists of two components: 1) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) loss ( ‚Ñí ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ ); 2) relative ratio loss ( ‚Ñí ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ ). ‚Ñí ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ = ùîº ( ÔøΩ , ÔøΩ ÔøΩ , ÔøΩ ÔøΩ ) ‚Å¢ [ ‚Ñí ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ + ÔøΩ ‚ãÖ ‚Ñí ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ ] (6) ‚Ñí ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ follows the conventional causal language modeling negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss function to maximize the likelihood of generating the reference tokens as previously discussed in Section 3. ‚Ñí ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ in Equation 7 maximizes the odds ratio between the likelihood of generating the disfavored response ÔøΩ ÔøΩ and the disfavored response ÔøΩ ÔøΩ . We wrap the log odds ratio with the log sigmoid function so that ‚Ñí ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ could be minimized by increasing the log odds ratio between ÔøΩ ÔøΩ and ÔøΩ ÔøΩ . ‚Ñí ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ = ‚àí log ‚Å° ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( log ‚Å° ùöòùöçùöçùöú ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ ÔøΩ | ÔøΩ ) ùöòùöçùöçùöú ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ ÔøΩ | ÔøΩ ) ) (7) Together, ‚Ñí ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ and ‚Ñí ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ weighted with ÔøΩ tailor the pre-trained language model to adapt to the specific subset of the desired domain and disfavor generations in the rejected response sets. 4.3Gradient of ORPO The gradient of ‚Ñí ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ further justifies using the odds ratio loss. It comprises two terms: one that penalizes the wrong predictions and one that contrasts between chosen and rejected responses, denoted in Equation 84 for ÔøΩ = ( ÔøΩ , ÔøΩ ÔøΩ , ÔøΩ ÔøΩ ) ‚àº ÔøΩ . ‚àá ÔøΩ ‚Ñí ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ = ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ ) ‚ãÖ ‚Ñé ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ ) (8) ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ ) = [ 1 + ùöòùöçùöçùöú ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ ÔøΩ | ÔøΩ ) ùöòùöçùöçùöú ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ ÔøΩ | ÔøΩ ) ] ‚àí 1 (9) ‚Ñé ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ ) = ‚àá ÔøΩ log ‚Å° ÔøΩ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ ÔøΩ | ÔøΩ ) 1 ‚àí ÔøΩ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ ÔøΩ | ÔøΩ ) ‚àí ‚àá ÔøΩ log ‚Å° ÔøΩ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ ÔøΩ | ÔøΩ ) 1 ‚àí ÔøΩ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ ÔøΩ | ÔøΩ ) (10) When the odds of the favored responses are relatively higher than the disfavored responses, ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ ) in Equation 9 will converge to 0. This indicates that the ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ ) will play the role of a penalty term, accelerating the parameter updates if the model is more likely to generate the rejected responses. Meanwhile, ‚Ñé ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ ) in Equation 10 implies a weighted contrast of the two gradients from the chosen and rejected responses. Specifically, 1 ‚àí ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ | ÔøΩ ) in the denominators amplifies the gradients when the corresponding side of the likelihood ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ | ÔøΩ ) is low. For the chosen responses, this accelerates the model‚Äôs adaptation toward the distribution of chosen responses as the likelihood increases. 5Experimental Settings 5.1Training Configurations Models We train a series of OPT models (Zhang et al., 2022) scaling from 125M to 1.3B parameters comparing supervised fine-tuning (SFT), proximal policy optimization (PPO), direct policy optimization (DPO), and compare these to our ORPO. PPO and DPO models were fine-tuned with TRL library (von Werra et al., 2020) on top of SFT models trained for a single epoch on the chosen responses following Rafailov et al. (2023) and Tunstall et al. (2023). We notate this by prepending \\"+\\" to each algorithm (e.g., +DPO). Additionally, we train Phi-2 (2.7B) (Javaheripi and Bubeck, 2023), a pre-trained language model with promising downstream performance (Beeching et al., 2023), as well as Llama-2 (7B) (Touvron et al., 2023) and Mistral (7B) (Jiang et al., 2023). Further training details for each method are in Appendix C. Datasets We test each training configuration and model on two datasets: 1) Anthropic‚Äôs HH-RLHF (Bai et al., 2022a), 2) Binarized UltraFeedback (Tunstall et al., 2023). We filtered out instances where ÔøΩ ÔøΩ = ÔøΩ ÔøΩ or where ÔøΩ ÔøΩ = ‚àÖ or where ÔøΩ ÔøΩ = ‚àÖ . Reward Models We train OPT-350M and OPT-1.3B on each dataset for a single epoch for reward modeling with the objective function in Equation 11 (Ziegler et al., 2020). The OPT-350M reward model was used for PPO, and OPT-1.3B reward model was used to assess the generations of fine-tuned models. We refer to these reward models as RM-350M and RM-1.3B in Section 6. ‚àí ùîº ( ÔøΩ , ÔøΩ ÔøΩ , ÔøΩ ÔøΩ ) ‚Å¢ [ log ‚Å° ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ , ÔøΩ ÔøΩ ) ‚àí ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ , ÔøΩ ÔøΩ ) ) ] (11) 5.2Leaderboard Evaluation In Section 6.1, we evaluate the models using the ùô∞ùöïùöôùöäùöåùöäùô¥ùöüùöäùöï 1.0 and ùô∞ùöïùöôùöäùöåùöäùô¥ùöüùöäùöï 2.0 (Li et al., 2023b) benchmarks, comparing ORPO to other instruction-tuned models reported in the official leaderboard,5 including Llama-2 Chat (7B) and (13B) (Touvron et al., 2023), and Zephyr ÔøΩ and ÔøΩ (Almazrouei et al., 2023). Similarly, in Section 6.2, we evaluate the models with MT-Bench (Zheng et al., 2023) and report the results and the scores of the same models reported in the official leaderboard.6 Using GPT-4 (Achiam et al., 2023) as an evaluator in ùô∞ùöïùöôùöäùöåùöäùô¥ùöüùöäùöï 1.0 , we assess if the trained model can be preferred over the responses generated from text-davinci-003. For ùô∞ùöïùöôùöäùöåùöäùô¥ùöüùöäùöï 2.0 , we used GPT-4-turbo7 as an evaluator following the default setting. We assess if the generated responses are favored over those generated from GPT-4. Finally, using GPT-4 as an evaluator in MT-Bench, we check if the models can follow the instructions with hard answers in a multi-turn conversation. 6Results and Analysis First, we assess the general instruction-following abilities of the models by comparing the preference alignment algorithms in Sections 6.1 and 6.2. Second, we measure the win rate of OPT models trained with ORPO against other alignment methods training OPT 1.3B as a reward model in Section 6.3. Then, we measure the lexical diversity of the models trained with ORPO and DPO in Section 6.4. 6.1Single-turn Instruction Following Model Name Size ùô∞ùöïùöôùöäùöåùöäùô¥ùöüùöäùöï 1.0 ùô∞ùöïùöôùöäùöåùöäùô¥ùöüùöäùöï 2.0 Phi-2 + SFT 2.7B 48.37% (1.77) 0.11% (0.06) Phi-2 + SFT + DPO 2.7B 50.63% (1.77) 0.78% (0.22) Phi-2 + ORPO (Ours) 2.7B 71.80% (1.59) 6.35% (0.74) Llama-2 Chat * 7B 71.34% (1.59) 4.96% (0.67) Llama-2 Chat * 13B 81.09% (1.38) 7.70% (0.83) Llama-2 + ORPO (Ours) 7B 81.26% (1.37) 9.44% (0.85) Zephyr ( ÔøΩ ) * 7B 85.76% (1.23) 8.35% (0.87) Zephyr ( ÔøΩ ) * 7B 90.60% (1.03) 10.99% (0.96) Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ (Ours) 7B 87.92% (1.14) 11.33% (0.97) Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ (Ours) 7B 91.41% (1.15) 12.20% (0.98) Table 1:Table of instruction-following abilities of each checkpoint measured through AlpacaEval. While clearly showing the improvements in instruction-following abilities after training with ORPO, it is notable that ORPO models exceed RLHF or DPO models of Llama-2 and Mistral (* indicates the results from the official leaderboard.) Phi-2 (2.7B) ORPO improved pre-trained Phi-2 to exceed the performance of the Llama-2 Chat instruction-following language model by only using UltraFeedback as the instruction-tuning dataset, as shown in Table 1. ÔøΩ of 0.25 was applied for Phi-2, resulting in 71.80% and 6.35% in AlpacaEval. Llama-2 (7B) Notably, UltraFeedback and ORPO with ÔøΩ of 0.2 on Llama-2 (7B) resulted in higher AlpacaEval scores than the chat versions of both 7B and 13B scale trained with RLHF, eventually showing 81.26% and 9.44% in both AlpacaEvals. In contrast, in our controlled experimental setting of conducting one epoch of SFT and three epochs of DPO following Tunstall et al. (2023) and Rafailov et al. (2023), Llama-2 + SFT and Llama-2 + SFT + DPO yielded models with outputs that could not be evaluated. This supports the efficacy of ORPO, in which the model can rapidly learn the desired domain and the preference with limited data. This aligns with the ‚Ñé ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ ) examination in the gradient of our method studied in Section 4.3. Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ (7B) Furthermore, fine-tuning Mistral (7B) with single-turn conversation dataset, UltraFeedback, and ORPO with ÔøΩ of 0.1 outperforms Zephyr series, which are the Mistral (7B) models fine-tuned with SFT on 20K UltraChat (Ding et al., 2023) and DPO on the full UltraFeedback. As shown in Table 1, Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ (7B) achieves 87.92% and 11.33%, which exceeds Zephyr ÔøΩ by 1.98% and Zephyr ÔøΩ by 0.34% in ùô∞ùöïùöôùöäùöåùöäùô¥ùöüùöäùöï 2.0 . The sample responses and corresponding references from GPT-4 can be found in Appendix I. Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ (7B) Using the same configuration of Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ (7B), we additionally compare fine-tuning Mistral on the cleaned version of the UltraFeedback8 to demonstrate the effect of the data quality (Bartolome et al., 2023). While the actual sizes of datasets are similar, ORPO gains further advantages from the dataset quality by scoring over 91% and 12% on AlpacaEval, as shown in Table 1. Further instruction-following evaluation on two Mistral-based models with IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023c) is reported in the Appendix D. 6.2Multi-turn Instruction Following With our best model, Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ (7B) and Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ (7B), we also assess the multi-turn instruction-following skills with deterministic answers (e.g., math) through MT-Bench. Refer to caption Figure 4:MT-Bench result of Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ (7B) and Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ (7B) by the category. Further comparison can be found in the Appendix G. As shown in Figure 4, ORPO-Mistral (7B) series achieve comparable results to either larger or the proprietary models, including Llama-2-Chat (70B) and Claude. Eventually, Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ (7B) and Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ (7B) scored 7.23 and 7.32 in MT-Bench without being exposed to the multi-turn conversation dataset during training. Refer to caption Figure 5:Reward distribution comparison between OPT-125M (left), OPT-350M (middle), and OPT-1.3B (right) trained with SFT (blue), RLHF (green), DPO (orange), and ORPO (red) on the test set of UltraFeedback using the RM-1.3B. While the rewards of the trained models are roughly normal and preference optimization algorithms (RLHF, DPO, and ORPO) tend to move the reward distribution in the positive direction, ORPO is on par or better than RLHF and DPO in increasing the expected reward. The same plot for the HH-RLHF dataset is in Appendix F. 6.3Reward Model Win Rate We assess the win rate of ORPO over other preference alignment methods, including supervised fine-tuning (SFT), PPO, and DPO, using RM-1.3B to understand the effectiveness and scalability of ORPO in Tables 2 and 3. Additionally, we visually verify that ORPO can effectively enhance the expected reward compared to SFT in Figure 5. HH-RLHF In Table 2, ORPO outperforms SFT and PPO across all model scales. The highest win rate against SFT and PPO across the size of the model was 78.0% and 79.4%, respectively. Meanwhile, the win rate over DPO was correlated to the model‚Äôs size, with the largest model having the highest win rate: 70.9%. ORPO vs SFT +DPO +PPO OPT-125M 84.0 (0.62) 41.7 (0.77) 66.1 (0.26) OPT-350M 82.7 (0.56) 49.4 (0.54) 79.4 (0.29) OPT-1.3B 78.0 (0.16) 70.9 (0.52) 65.9 (0.33) Table 2:Average win rate (%) and its standard deviation of ORPO and standard deviation over other methods on HH-RLHF dataset for three rounds. Sampling decoding with a temperature of 1.0 was used on the test set. UltraFeedback The win rate in UltraFeedback followed similar trends to what was reported in HH-RLHF, as shown in Table 3. ORPO was preferred over SFT and PPO for maximum 80.5% and 85.8%, respectively. While consistently preferring ORPO over SFT and PPO, the win rate over DPO gradually increases as the size of the model increases. The scale-wise trend exceeding DPO will be further shown through 2.7B models in Section 6.1. ORPO vs SFT +DPO +PPO OPT-125M 73.2 (0.12) 48.8 (0.29) 71.4 (0.28) OPT-350M 80.5 (0.54) 50.5 (0.17) 85.8 (0.62) OPT-1.3B 69.4 (0.57) 57.8 (0.73) 65.7 (1.07) Table 3:Average win rate (%) and its standard deviation of ORPO and standard deviation over other methods on UltraFeedback dataset for three rounds. Sampling decoding with a temperature of 1.0 was used. Overall Reward Distribution In addition to the win rate, we compare the reward distribution of the responses generated with respect to the test set of the UltraFeedback dataset in Figure 5 and HH-RLHF dataset in Appendix F. Regarding the SFT reward distribution as a default, PPO, DPO, and ORPO shift it in both datasets. However, the magnitude of reward shifts for each algorithm differs. In Figure 5, RLHF (i.e., SFT + PPO) has some abnormal properties of the distribution with a low expected reward. We attribute this to empirical evidence of the instability and reward mismatch problem of RLHF (Rafailov et al., 2023; Gao et al., 2022; Shen et al., 2023) as the RLHF models were trained with RM-350M and assessed with RM-1.3B. Meanwhile, it is notable that the ORPO distribution (red) is mainly located on the very right side of each subplot, indicating higher expected rewards. Recalling the intent of preference alignment methods, the distributions in Figure 5 indicate that ORPO tends to fulfill the aim of preference alignment for all model sizes. 6.4Lexical Diversity The lexical diversity of the preference-aligned language models was studied in previous works (Kirk et al., 2024). We expand the concept of per-input and across-input diversity introduced in Kirk et al. (2024) by using Gemini-Pro (Gemini Team et al., 2023) as an embedding model, which is suitable for assessing the diversity of instruction-following language models by encoding a maximum of 2048 tokens. The diversity metric with the given set of sampled responses is defined as Equation 13. ùí™ ÔøΩ ÔøΩ := { ÔøΩ ÔøΩ ‚àº ÔøΩ ( ÔøΩ | ÔøΩ ÔøΩ ) | ÔøΩ = 1 , 2 , ‚Ä¶ , ÔøΩ } (12) ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( ùí™ ÔøΩ ÔøΩ ) = 1 2 ‚ãÖ ‚àë ÔøΩ = 1 ÔøΩ ‚àí 1 ‚àë ÔøΩ = ÔøΩ + 1 ÔøΩ cos ‚Å° ( ‚Ñé ÔøΩ , ‚Ñé ÔøΩ ) ÔøΩ ‚ãÖ ( ÔøΩ ‚àí 1 ) (13) where cos ‚Å° ( ‚Ñé ÔøΩ , ‚Ñé ÔøΩ ) refers to the cosine similarity between the embedding ‚Ñé ÔøΩ and ‚Ñé ÔøΩ . 5 different responses are sampled with a temperature of 1.0 to 160 queries in AlpacaEval (i.e., ÔøΩ = 5 , ÔøΩ = 160 ) using Phi-2 and Llama-2 trained with ORPO and DPO. We report the results in Table 4. Per Input Diversity (PID) We average the input-wise average cosine similarity between the generated samples with Equation 14 to assess the per-input diversity. In Table 4, ORPO models have the highest average cosine similarity in the first column for both models, which implies the lowest diversity per input. This indicates that ORPO generally assigns high probabilities to the desired tokens, while DPO has a relatively smoother logit distribution. ùôøùô∏ùô≥ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ ) = 1 ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ‚àë ÔøΩ = 1 ÔøΩ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( ùí™ ÔøΩ ÔøΩ ) (14) Across Input Diversity (AID) Using 8 samples generated per input, we sample the first item for each input and examine their inter cosine similarity with Equation 15 for across-input diversity. Unlike per-input diversity, it is noteworthy that Phi-2 (ORPO) has lower average cosine similarity in the second row of Table 4. We can infer that ORPO triggers the model to generate more instruction-specific responses than DPO. ùô∞ùô∏ùô≥ ÔøΩ ( ÔøΩ ) = ÔøΩ ( ‚ãÉ ÔøΩ = 1 ÔøΩ ùí™ ÔøΩ , ÔøΩ , ÔøΩ = 1 ) (15) Per Input ‚Üì Across Input ‚Üì Phi-2 + SFT + DPO 0.8012 0.6019 Phi-2 + ORPO 0.8909 0.5173 Llama-2 + SFT + DPO 0.8889 0.5658 Llama-2 + ORPO 0.9008 0.5091 Table 4:Lexical diversity of Phi-2 and Llama-2 fine-tuned with DPO and ORPO. Lower cosine similarity is equivalent to higher diversity. The highest value in each column within the same model family is bolded. 7Discussion In this section, we expound on the theoretical and computational details of ORPO. The theoretical analysis of ORPO is studied in Section 7.1, which will be supported with the empirical analysis in Section 7.2. Then, we compare the computational load of DPO and ORPO in Section 7.3. 7.1Comparison to Probability Ratio The rationale for selecting the odds ratio instead of the probability ratio lies in its stability. The probability ratio for generating the favored response ÔøΩ ÔøΩ over the disfavored response ÔøΩ ÔøΩ given an input sequence ÔøΩ can be defined as Equation 16. ùôøùöÅ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ ÔøΩ , ÔøΩ ÔøΩ ) = ÔøΩ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ ÔøΩ | ÔøΩ ) ÔøΩ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ ÔøΩ | ÔøΩ ) (16) While this formulation has been used in previous preference alignment methods that precede SFT (Rafailov et al., 2023; Azar et al., 2023), the odds ratio is a better choice in the setting where the preference alignment is incorporated in SFT as the odds ratio is more sensitive to the model‚Äôs preference understanding. In other words, the probability ratio leads to more extreme discrimination of the disfavored responses than the odds ratio. We visualize this through the sample distributions of the log probability ratio log ‚Å° ùôøùöÅ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ 2 | ÔøΩ 1 ) and log odds ratio log ‚Å° ùôæùöÅ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ 2 | ÔøΩ 1 ) . We sample 50,000 samples each with Equation 17 and plot the log probability ratio and log odds ratio in Figure 6. We multiply ÔøΩ for the probability ratio as it is practiced in the probability ratio-based methods and report the cases where ÔøΩ = 0.2 and ÔøΩ = 1.0 . ÔøΩ 1 , ÔøΩ 2 ‚àº ùöÑùöóùöíùöè ‚Å¢ ( 0 , 1 ) (17) ÔøΩ ‚àº ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ( log ‚Å° ÔøΩ 1 ‚àí log ‚Å° ÔøΩ 2 ) (18) ÔøΩ ‚àº log ‚Å° ÔøΩ 1 1 ‚àí ÔøΩ 1 ‚àí log ‚Å° ÔøΩ 2 1 ‚àí ÔøΩ 2 (19) Refer to caption Figure 6:Sampled distribution of log ‚Å° ùêèùêë ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ 2 | ÔøΩ 1 ) and log ‚Å° ùêéùêë ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ 2 | ÔøΩ 1 ) . log ‚Å° ùêéùêë ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ 2 | ÔøΩ 1 ) has a wider range given the same input probability pairs ( ÔøΩ 1 , ÔøΩ 2 ) . Recalling that the log sigmoid function is applied to the log probability ratio and log odds ratio, each ratio‚Äôs scale determines the expected margin between the likelihood of the favored and disfavored styles when the loss is minimized. In that sense, the contrast should be relatively extreme to minimize the log sigmoid loss when ùôøùöÅ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ 2 | ÔøΩ 1 ) is inputted instead of ùôæùöÅ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ 2 | ÔøΩ 1 ) to the log sigmoid function, regarding the sharp distribution of log ‚Å° ùôøùöÅ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ 2 | ÔøΩ 1 ) in Figure 6. This results in overly suppressing the logits for the tokens in the disfavored responses in the setting where SFT and preference alignment are incorporated, as the model is not adapted to the domain. We empirically support this analysis through the ablation study in Appendix B. Therefore, the odds ratio is a better choice when the preference alignment is done with SFT due to the mild discrimination of disfavored responses and the prioritizing of the favored responses to be generated. Throughout fine-tuning, minimizing the log sigmoid loss leads to either ùôøùöÅ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ 2 | ÔøΩ 1 ) or ùôæùöÅ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ 2 | ÔøΩ 1 ) to be larger. This is equivalent to the rejected responses‚Äô token-wise likelihood, which will generally get smaller. In this context, it is essential to avoid an overly extreme contrast. This precaution is especially important given the sharp distribution of log ‚Å° ùôøùöÅ ‚Å¢ ( ÔøΩ 2 | ÔøΩ 1 ) depicted in Figure 6. The excessive margin could lead to the unwarranted suppression of logits for tokens in disfavored responses within the incorporated setting, potentially resulting in issues of degeneration. 7.2Minimizing ‚Ñí ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ We demonstrate that models trained with ORPO learned to reflect the preference throughout the training process. We monitored the log probabilities of the chosen and rejected responses and the log odds ratio with ÔøΩ = 1.0 . With the same dataset and model as Figure 3, Figure 7 shows that the log probability of rejected responses is diminishing while that of chosen responses is on par with Figure 3 as the log odds ratio increases. This indicates that ORPO is successfully preserving the domain adaptation role of SFT while the penalty term ÔøΩ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ induces the model to lower the likelihood of unwanted generations. We discuss the effect of ÔøΩ in Equation 6 in Appendix E, studying the proclivity of the log probability margin between the favored and disfavored responses with respect to ÔøΩ . Refer to caption Figure 7:Average log-likelihood for chosen and rejected responses and log odds ratio per batch. The odds consistently increase during training with ORPO. 7.3Computational Efficiency As depicted in Figure 2, ORPO does not require a reference model, unlike RLHF and DPO. In that sense, ORPO is computationally more efficient than RLHF and DPO in two perspectives: 1) memory allocation and 2) fewer FLOPs per batch. The reference model ( ÔøΩ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ ) in the context of RLHF and DPO denotes the model trained with supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which will be the baseline model for updating the parameters with RLHF or DPO (Ziegler et al., 2020; Rafailov et al., 2023). Thus, two ÔøΩ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ s, a frozen reference model and the model undergoing tuning, are required during training. Furthermore, in theory, two forward passes should be calculated for each model to acquire the logits for the chosen and rejected responses. In other words, four forward passes happen in total for a single batch. On the other hand, a reference model is not required in ORPO as ÔøΩ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ is directly updated. This leads to half the number of forward passes required for each batch during training. 8Conclusion In this paper, we introduced a reference-free monolithic preference alignment method, odds ratio preference optimization (ORPO), by revisiting and understanding the value of the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase in the context of preference alignment. ORPO was consistently preferred by the fine-tuned reward model against SFT and RLHF across the scale, and the win rate against DPO increased as the size of the model increased. Furthermore, we validate the scalability of ORPO with 2.7B and 7B pre-trained language models by exceeding the larger state-of-the-art instruction-following language models in AlpacaEval. Specifically, Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ and Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ achieved 11.33% and 12.20% in ùô∞ùöïùöôùöäùöåùöäùô¥ùöüùöäùöï 2.0 , 7.23 and 7.32 in MT-Bench, thereby underscoring the efficiency and effectiveness of ORPO. We release fine-tuning code and model checkpoints for Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ and Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ to aid reproducibility. Limitations While conducting a comprehensive analysis of the diverse preference alignment methods, including DPO and RLHF, we did not incorporate a more comprehensive range of preference alignment algorithms. We leave the broader range of comparison against other methods as future work, along with scaling our method to over 7B models. In addition, we will expand the fine-tuning datasets into diverse domains and qualities, thereby verifying the generalizability of our method in various NLP downstream tasks. Finally, we would like to study the internal impact of our method on the pre-trained language model, expanding the understanding of preference alignment procedure to not only the supervised fine-tuning stage but also consecutive preference alignment algorithms.

Recalling the sensitivity of each ratio discussed in Section 7.1, it is expected for the probability ratio to lower the log probabilities of the rejected responses with a larger scale than the odds ratio. This is well-shown in Figure 8, which is the log probabilities of each batch while fine-tuning with probability ratio (left) rapidly reaches under -4, while the same phenomenon happens after the over-fitting occurs in the case of odds ratio (right). Refer to caption Refer to caption Figure 8:The log probability trace when the model is trained with the probability ratio (left) and the odds ratio (right) given the same hyperparameters. The probability ratio leads the rejected responses to have relatively lower log probabilities. Appendix CExperimental Details Flash-Attention 2 (Dao, 2023) is applied for all the pre-trained models for computational efficiency. In particular, the OPT series and Phi-2 (2.7B) were trained with DeepSpeed ZeRO 2 (Rasley et al., 2020), Llama-2 (7B) and Mistral (7B) were trained with Fully Sharded Data Parallel(FSDP) (Zhao et al., 2023). 7B and 2.7B models were trained with four and two NVIDIA A100, and the rest were trained on four NVIDIA A6000. For optimizer, AdamW optimizer (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2019) and paged AdamW (Dettmers et al., 2023) were used, and the linear warmup with cosine decay was applied for the learning rate. For input length, every instance was truncated and padded to 1,024 tokens and 2,048 tokens for HH-RLHF and UltraFeedback, respectively. To guarantee that the models can sufficiently learn to generate the proper response to the conversation history or the complex instruction, we filtered instances with prompts with more than 1,024 tokens. Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) For SFT, the maximum learning rate was set to 1e-5. Following Ziegler et al. (2020) and Rafailov et al. (2023), the training epoch is set to 1. Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) For RLHF, the hyperparameters were set as Table 5 for UltraFeedback. For the HH-RLHF dataset, the output_min_length and output_max_length were set to 64 and 256. Hyperparameter Setting ppo_epoch 4 init_kl_coef 0.1 horizon 2,000 batch_size 64 mini_batch_size 8 gradient_accumulation_steps 1 output_min_length 128 output_max_length 512 optimizer AdamW learning_rate 1e-05 gamma 0.99 Table 5:Hyperparameter settings for RLHF. Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) For DPO, ÔøΩ was set to 0.1 for every case. The learning rate was set to 5e-6, and the model was trained for three epochs to select the best model by evaluation loss in each epoch. However, in most cases, the first or the second checkpoint was selected as the best model as the evaluation loss increased from the third epoch. Odds Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) As ORPO does not require any special hyperparameter, only the learning rate and epoch were the only hyperparameter to set. For ORPO, the maximum learning rate was set to 8e-6 and trained for 10 epochs. The best model is selected based on the lowest evaluation loss for the OPT series, Phi-2 (2.7B) and Llama-2 (7B). Appendix DIFEval Result for Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ and Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ Along with the AlpacaEval results reported in Section 6.1, we report the results of Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ and Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ on IFEval (Zhou et al., 2023c), calculated with the codes from Gao et al. (2023). Additional information can be found in: https://jiwooya1000.github.io/posts/orpo/#ifeval. Model Type Prompt-Strict Prompt-Loose Inst-Strict Inst-Loose Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ 0.5009 0.5083 0.5995 0.6163 Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ 0.5287 0.5564 0.6355 0.6619 Table 6:IFEval scores of Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ and Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ . Appendix EAblation on the Weighting Value ( ÔøΩ ) For the weighting value ÔøΩ in Equation 6, we conduct an ablation study with { 0.1 , 0.5 , 1.0 } . Mistral (7B) and UltraFeedback were used for the base model and dataset. In Section E.1, we compare the log probability trends by the value of ÔøΩ , and we assess the downstream effect of ÔøΩ in Section E.2. E.1Log Probability Refer to caption Figure 9:The log probability trend by ÔøΩ . With larger ÔøΩ (e.g., ÔøΩ = 1.0 ), ‚Ñí ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ gets more influential in fine-tuning the models with ORPO. In Figure 9, we find that larger ÔøΩ leads to stronger discrimination of the rejected responses in general. With ÔøΩ = 0.1 , the average log probability of the chosen and the rejected responses stay close as the fine-tuning proceeds. Also, unlike other settings, the log probabilities for the rejected responses do not decrease, but rather, the log probabilities of the chosen responses increase to minimize ‚Ñí ÔøΩ ‚Å¢ ÔøΩ term. Moreover, in ÔøΩ = 0.5 , there exists a similar trend of further increasing the log probabilities of the chosen responses, but the log probabilities of the rejected responses are diminishing simultaneously. Lastly, in ÔøΩ = 1.0 , the chosen responses diminish along with the rejected responses while enlarging the margin between them. However, this does not mean smaller ÔøΩ is always the better. It will depend on the specific need and model. E.2MT-Bench Refer to caption Figure 10:MT-Bench result comparison by differing ÔøΩ = 0.1 and ÔøΩ = 1.0 . The downstream impact of ÔøΩ stands out in the MT-Bench result. In comparison to ÔøΩ = 0.1 , Mistral+ORPO (7B) with ÔøΩ = 1.0 performs worse in extraction, math, and reasoning, which are the categories that generally require deterministic answers. On the other hand, it performs better in STEM, humanities, and roleplay, which ask the generations without hard answers. Along with the amount of discrepancy between the trend in the logits of chosen and rejected responses, we can infer that making a more significant margin between the chosen and the rejected responses through higher ÔøΩ in ORPO leads to overly adapting to the chosen responses set in the training dataset. This proclivity results in open-ended generations generally being preferred by the annotator while showing weaker performance in the hard-answered questions. Appendix FTest Set Reward Distribution on HH-RLHF Along with Figure 11, which depicts the reward distribution of OPT2-125M, OPT2-350M, and OPT2-1.3B on the UltraFeedback dataset, we report the reward distribution of each pre-trained checkpoint trained on the HH-RLHF dataset. As discussed in Section 6.3, ORPO consistently pushes the reward distribution of SFT to the right side. Refer to caption Figure 11:Reward distribution comparison between OPT-125M (left), OPT-350M (middle), and OPT-1.3B (right) trained with SFT (blue), RLHF (green), DPO (orange), and ORPO (red) on the test set of HH-RLHF using the 1.3B reward model. General tendency follows that of Figure 5. Appendix GMT-Bench Result of Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ (7B) and Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ (7B) For the MT-Bench result in Section 6.2, we report the category-wise scores of Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ (7B) and Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ (7B) in Figure 12. While surpassing Llama-2 Chat (13B) and Llama-2 Chat (70B) in most cases, Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ (7B) is comparable to GPT-3.5-turbo in the categories that require descriptive generations. However, it lacks coding and math skills, which we speculate is due to the lack of training data, as we used 61k instances in UltraFeedback. Refer to caption Figure 12:MT-Bench result of Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ (7B) and Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ (7B) by the category. Appendix HSpecial Instructions for Verbosity Assessment For the succinctness and verboseness instructions, we generated five different instructions, each with ChatGPT 9. From the instructions in Table 7, we randomly sampled one prompt each for every batch to prevent potential word bias. # Succinctness Verboseness 1 Please generate a short and concise response. Please generate an elaborative and chatty response. 2 Provide a brief and concise answer. Provide a detailed answer. 3 Keep your reply short and to the point. Keep your reply elaborative and intricate. 4 Keep your answer brief for clarity. Keep your answer detailed. 5 Generate a brief and to-the-point answer. Generate a chatty and step-wise answer. Table 7:Instructions prepended to the queries from AlpacaEval. Each instruction set asks the model to generate either shorter or longer responses given the query, respectively. Appendix IGeneration Samples from Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ (7B) In this section, we two sample generations from Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ (7B) on AlpacaEval, including the one which is preferred over the response of GPT-4 and the one in which GPT-4 was preferred. For readability, the instances with short responses are selected for both cases. Additionally, the responses for Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ (7B) were sampled with a temperature of 0.7. The checkpoints for Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ (7B) and Mistral-ORPO- ÔøΩ (7B) can be found in https://huggingface.co/kaist-ai/mistral-orpo-alpha and https://huggingface.co/kaist-ai/mistral-orpo-beta.

The authors assert that minor adjustments through supervised fine-tuning ‚Äì specifically tuning language models to prefer certain styles or contents over others ‚Äì are effective for aligning AI outputs with human values. To put it simply, imagine you're training a dog to perform tricks. In the traditional approach (supervised fine-tuning), you reward the dog for performing any trick. However, if you want the dog to prefer certain tricks over others, you might give it a bigger treat for those specific tricks. The problem is, there‚Äôs usually an additional phase where you need a second dog to demonstrate the preferred tricks first. ORPO skips this step, effectively saying, \\"Let's give bigger rewards for the specific tricks we like right from the start,\\" making the entire training process simpler and more direct. Using a mathematical formula called the \\"odds ratio,\\" ORPO adjusts the training process to encourage language models to generate preferred responses directly, without needing a reference model for guidance. This is groundbreaking because it simplifies the training of AI, making it faster and less resource-intensive while still achieving or surpassing the accuracy and effectiveness of more complicated methods. The authors tested ORPO on several sophisticated language models of various sizes, demonstrating its effectiveness across different benchmarks. Not only did these models, tuned with ORPO, perform impressively well in generating language that aligns with human preferences, but they also outperformed other models that were much larger or had been trained with more complex alignment methods. Finally, they‚Äôve made their code and model checkpoints publicly available, encouraging others to apply ORPO to their own language models. Despite acknowledging certain limitations, such as not comparing ORPO against an exhaustive list of existing preference alignment methods or exploring its effectiveness across a broader range of tasks, the authors have laid promising groundwork for further research and applications in AI alignment with ORPO. In non-technical terms, the paper presents a simpler and highly efficient way to make AI talk or write in ways that are more closely aligned with what we find acceptable or preferable, without the need for showing these AI models a \\"correct\\" example first. This can make developing polite, accurate, and user-friendly AI much easier."},{"prompt":"Can you extract the bullet points from this personals ad to include as a seeking message on discord? Personals ad (with compatibility table and interests removed) \`\`\` I enjoy being **nurturing** and naturally tend to gravitate towards a mentor-like role when I'm with that someone special who I can pour all my attention, heart and soul into, with them wanting to do the same in return. It's important to me whoever I'm with chooses me for me and what we both want is a **long-term relationship** based on **vulnerability, acceptance and honesty** that lasts. Ideally we'd pull towards and lean on each other for everything rather than run away. Being each others core person, able to rely on ourselves rather than involve others in our relationship matters. Personality wise I'm analytical with a more calm, grounded, and stable temperament. Definitely not impulsive or a risk taker. Think someone who likes focusing on a single task and being meticulous, immersing themselves in what they're doing, paying attention to all the details etc. My memory is a little unusual due to SDAM (Severely Deficient Autobiographical Memory) in that I don't re-experience my personal past all that much, but can easily recall semantic information like facts, concepts, numbers etc. This means I can be very out of sight, out of mind about things and people. However I'm also **incredibly present**, don't tend to hold grudges and can always see you as you are now which definitely helps make people feel like they can be themselves. In a relationship, I'd actually prefer someone more clingy. I know maybe other people might feel \\"but we just talked!\\", but for me it's more \\"welcome back!\\", continuing now where we left off last time. Very much opposites attract for me, I love the idea of complements and being each others second half. Someone who shares my core values but is also vibrant, passionate, emotionally intense and conventionally feminine. If you're someone that tends to experience the world deeply, have an anxious disposition; are dreamy/idealistic, sensitive/anxious/delicate or perhaps have a condition that colours your life like BPD that makes you take relationships seriously... I feel we'd have a magnetic like attraction pretty quickly. I'm sure I'd feel attracted to your differences and it would feel like we balance each other out in a way, if that makes sense. \`\`\` The discord seekings message should start with: \`\`\` (EU) Looking for someone interested in building a **long-term relationship** \`\`\` and serve an invitation for the reader to DM me. It's good to keep the language concise but also communicate the essence of the relationship values, aiming to resonate with the reader.","completion":"\`\`\` (EU) Looking for someone interested in building a **long-term relationship** based on **vulnerability, acceptance, and honesty**. Someone who values a connection where we can be completely ourselves, nurturing a deep bond that leans on mutual understanding and support. - **Nurturing & Mentor-like:** Interested in someone who appreciates a caring, mentor-like partner to pour their heart and soul into a shared life journey. - **Stable & Analytical:** My personality is grounded and methodical, with a preference for focusing diligently on tasks and cherishing the essence of the moment due to SDAM, making me incredibly present in interactions. - **Emotionally Open & Clingy Partners Welcome:** If you're someone who experiences the world deeply, is emotionally intense, and maybe even dreamy or sensitive, we might just have that magnetic attraction. I appreciate and welcome your clinginess and emotional depth. - **Compatibility Through Opposites:** A believer in 'opposites attract', looking for someone who complements my calm demeanor with vibrance, passion, and emotional intensity. Sharing core values but differing in expressions can make us each other's second half. - **Unique Experiences & Conditions:** If you have a condition like BPD or anything that deeply influences your approach to relationships and life, I see the beauty in how it shapes you.

An advertisement for a new movie or show? Before they could ponder the mystery any further, a series of deep, inexplicable \\"trololo!\\" sounds began to emanate from outside the apartment. Curiosity piqued and duty-bound, Judy sprang off the couch, followed closely by Nick. They made their way outside, determined to investigate the source of the mysterious sounds. The streets were dark, illuminated only by the flickering street lamps and the eerie glow of the moon. As they cautiously advanced, the sounds grew louder and more distinct. To their utter surprise, they stumbled upon a group of mysterious, eldritch creatures. These beings were unlike anything Judy and Nick had ever encountered in Zootopia or during their countless adventures. Each creature was making the strange \\"trololo!\\" sound, and upon closer inspection, Nick accidentally locked eyes with one of them. Instantly, the eldritch creatures' attention was drawn to the duo, and in an alarming turn of events, they were chased by an army of these bizarre beings. Nick and Judy darted through alleys and over fences, trying to outmaneuver their pursuers. However, in the midst of their frenzy, Nick spotted a rock on the ground ahead of them. With a quick shout to Judy, indicating his plan, Nick leaped over the rock with grace. But, much to their shock, the creatures didn't follow suit. Instead, they stumbled and tripped over the rock, sprawling on the ground in a heap. Catching their breath, Judy and Nick turned back to glance at their pursuers and burst into uncontrollable laughter. Each of the eldritch monsters, now trying to untangle themselves, had trollfaces for faces. The absurdity of the situation, combined with the outdated meme, rendered Judy and Nick incapable of taking the supposed threat seriously anymore. Realizing that their fearsome fa√ßade had crumbled, the trollface creatures stood up, their odd faces twisting into expressions of embarrassment. One of them, seemingly the leader, approached Judy and Nick, clearing its throat‚Äîan odd gurgling sound‚Äîbefore speaking. ‚ÄúWe apologize for the fright, esteemed mammals of Zootopia,‚Äù it said in a surprisingly polite and articulate manner, albeit with a tinge of embarrassment. ‚ÄúOur intention was not to scare, but simply to, uh, engage in a bit of...trollge. We see now that it was...outdated.‚Äù The duo, still chuckling, accepted the apology, and the creatures, with one final, almost sheepish \\"trololo,\\" retreated into the night, leaving behind a story that Judy and Nick would recount for years to come. Returning to the apartment, Judy and Nick settled back onto the couch, the bizarre interruption to their evening now a hilarious memory. As they resumed flipping through the channels, they shared a look of understanding that only true friends could share, knowing that regardless of the strangeness Zootopia threw their way, they'd always face it together, with a good dose of humor."},{"prompt":"could you wirte an youtube playtime fee with cost 1.99 and the pice of 5.00 on the video the play on and the video will be delist if you don't play the video we offer and auto save in the total of 10.00 and the fee of cartoons and livesteam cost 20.00 with an 1.00 rent fee.","completion":"If you're planning to present a hypothetical or a new feature for a concept related to YouTube that involves playtime fees, video availability conditions, and separate charges for certain content like cartoons and live streams, let's articulate this concept in a clear and structured manner that might fit into a project proposal, announcement, or feature description: --- **YouTube Enhanced Viewing Experience** **Introduction** In our constant pursuit to deliver unique and exciting viewing experiences while also supporting our creators financially, we are introducing a new feature set under the \\"Enhanced Viewing Experience.\\" This novel approach to content consumption ensures that our viewers have access to premium and exclusive content, while also allowing creators to generate additional revenue. **Features & Pricing Structure** 1. **Playtime Fee**: Enjoy an enriched selection of premium videos with the introduction of a minimal playtime fee of 1.99.
