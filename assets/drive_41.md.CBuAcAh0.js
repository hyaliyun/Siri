We need to evaluate ( v_{p}(mathrm{N}!) ), which represents the exponent of the prime ( p ) in the factorization of ( mathrm{N}! ). 2.

To derive ( sum_{i=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{N}{p^i} rightrfloor ), we use the following steps: - Write down the numbers from 1 to ( N ) in a list. - For every ( i ) from 1 to ( v_{p}(mathrm{N}) ), place a mark (point) at all multiples of ( p^i ). 4. The total number of points corresponds to the term ( sum_{i=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{N}{p^i} rightrfloor ), as every number ( k in [1, N] ) receives ( v_{p}(k) ) points. 5. Hence, the total number of points counts the sum and therefore satisfies the equality: [ sum_{i=1}^{infty} leftlfloor frac{N}{p^i} rightrfloor = v_{p}(N!) ] **Part (b):** 1. Using the property ( binom{N}{k} = frac{N!}{k!(N-k)!} ), we aim to find ( v_{p}left(binom{N}{k}right) ), which is the exponent of ( p ) in ( binom{N}{k} ). 2.

Given ( N = p^n ) and ( N geq k ), we use the previously established formula for ( v_{p}(N!) ): 4. For all ( i in [1, v_{p}(k)] ): [ leftlfloor frac{N}{p^i} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{k}{p^i} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{N-k}{p^i} rightrfloor ] 5.

Kenzo has 80 chairs with 5 legs each, so that's a total of: 80 chairs * 5 legs/chair = 400 legs from chairs He also has 20 tables with 3 legs each, so that's a total of: 20 tables * 3 legs/table = 60 legs from tables The total number of legs before any damage is: 400 legs from chairs + 60 legs from tables = 460 legs Now, we know that after the damage, Kenzo has 300 legs remaining. This means that the number of legs that were disposed of is: 460 original legs - 300 remaining legs = 160 legs disposed of Since each chair has 5 legs, we can find out how many chairs were disposed of by dividing the number of disposed legs by the number of legs per chair: 160 disposed legs / 5 legs/chair = 32 chairs disposed of Now, to find the percentage of chairs that were damaged and disposed of, we divide the number of disposed chairs by the original number of chairs and multiply by 100 to get the percentage: (32 disposed chairs / 80 original chairs) * 100 = 40% So, boxed{40%} of the chairs were damaged and disposed of."},{"prompt":"right triangle ABC, where ∠C = 90°, and the sides opposite angles A, B, and C are a, b, and c respectively, satisfy the condition a + b = cx.

This property will be essential in understanding how the values of f(x) compare to each other based on the input x. 2. **Monotonically decreasing on left[0,+infty right)**: Since f(x) is monotonically decreasing for x geq 0, it means that for any x_1 > x_2 geq 0, we have f(x_1) < f(x_2). Additionally, for negative inputs, due to the even nature of f(x), the function will be monotonically increasing on left(-infty, 0right]. 3. **Considering f(1)=0**: Given that f(1) = 0 and f(x) is monotonically decreasing on left[0,+infty right), any f(x) geq 0 must occur for x leq 1 due to monotonicity.

Since T's vertices A and B (which are part of mathcal{P}) are already colored, there are exactly two prohibited colors for X. - Choose the remaining color for X to ensure T meets the requirement of one vertex per color. 5. **Selecting the Guarding Set**: - Out of the n colored vertices, each color appears exactly n/3 times. - In case the division is not exact (since leftlfloorfrac{n}{3}rightrfloor is the floor function of the division), the color with the minimum count among blue, red, and yellow will still be at most leftlfloorfrac{n}{3}rightrfloor. 6. **Ensuring Guarding**: - Select all vertices of the least frequent color. These leftlfloorfrac{n}{3}rightrfloor vertices ensure that for any interior point X in a triangle, there is at least one vertex of the selected color such that the segment [CX] lies entirely within mathcal{P}.

Let (r(n)) denote the odd positive integer whose binary representation is the reverse of the binary representation of (n). Claim: If (a, b, c) are in an arithmetic progression and have the same number of digits in their binary representations, then (r(a), r(b), r(c)) cannot be in arithmetic progression in that order. Proof: 1. Consider (a, b, c) in arithmetic progression, meaning (b = frac{a + c}{2}). 2. Since (a, b, c) have the same number of binary digits, let’s denote the binary representations as (b_k b_{k-1} cdots b_1 b_0), where (b_i in {0, 1}). 3. Let’s focus on the least significant digit that differs among (a) and (b). This differing digit is significant when reversed. 4. When reversing the bits: - The least significant differing digit in (a) and (b) becomes the most significant digit in (r(a)) and (r(b)). 5. Without loss of generality, assume the differing significant digit is at position (i), thus: - (a) and (c) would have the same bit at position (i), but (b) would have a different bit. 6. Consequently, when reversed, (r(b)) will have the reverse order where this differing bit becomes a key difference that disrupts the potential arithmetic progression among (r(a), r(b), r(c)). Hence, (r(a), r(b), r(c)) cannot form an arithmetic progression in that order due to this reversal property. To conclude the solution, consider an eight-term arithmetic progression given by (a_1, a_1 + d, a_1 + 2d, ldots, a_1 + 7d). We now need to show that at least three of these terms (a_i) have the same number of binary digits. # Case Analysis: 1. **Case 1**: If (a_{1} + 3d < 2^k leq a_{1} + 4d). - Then (a_{1} + 4d, a_{1} + 5d, a_{1} + 6d) will have the same number of binary digits. 2. **Case 2**: If (a_{1} + 4d < 2^k leq a_{1} + 5d). - Then (a_{1} + 5d, a_{1} + 6d, a_{1} + 7d) will have the same number of binary digits. 3. **Case 3**: If neither of the above conditions hold (i.e., (a_{1} + 3d geq 2^k leq a_{1} + 5d)). - Then (a_{1} + 3d, a_{1} + 4d, a_{1} + 5d) will have the same number of binary digits. In all scenarios, we find three terms that share the same number of binary digits. By our claim and proof, the reverse of these terms cannot form an arithmetic progression. # Conclusion: Thus, there does not exist a strictly increasing eight-term arithmetic progression of odd positive integers such that (r(a_1), ldots, r(a_8)) form an arithmetic progression in that same order.

Reflecting the path between (A) and (B) over the line (AB) would result in a shape that strictly contains (P) with a potentially larger area.

The line segment BQ intersects the circle omega a second time at point K. On the minor arc BK of omega, a point L is marked such that angle LAK = angle CQB.

Thus: [ angle LAK = angle LBK ] 3. From the problem conditions, we know: [ angle LAK = angle CQB ] 4. To progress, notice that because PC = QC, the line through C perpendicular to the tangent PQ contains the diameter of circle omega and is therefore perpendicular to the chord BL. This implies that points B and L are symmetric with respect to the perpendicular line through C, making BL parallel PQ. 5. Since PQ is tangent to the circle at C, and BL parallel PQ, the perpendicular from C to PQ is also the perpendicular bisector of BL. It implies that: [ BL parallel PQ ] and [ BQ = CP ] 6.

We need to show ( |A| = 1 ) or ( |B| = 1 ). 6. **Forest and Tree Structure of ( G )**: Since ( G ) is bipartite and has no path of length 3, it implies ( G ) has no cycles and is a forest (a collection of trees). The number of trees in the forest ( G ) can be calculated as: [ # text{ vertices } - # text{ edges } = (|A| + |B|) - (|A| + |B| - 1) = 1 ] Hence, ( G ) is a single tree. 7. **Tree Structure and Star Graph**: If ( G ) is a single tree and has no path of length 3, then ( G ) must be a star graph. In a bipartite star graph, the central vertex must be in one class and all the leaves in the other class, implying either ( |A| = 1 ) or ( |B| = 1 ). 8. **Conclusion**: Therefore, if there are no paths of length 3, then ( |A| = 1 ) or ( |B| = 1 ). Hence, assuming ( |A| geq 2 ) and ( |B| geq 2 ), the graph ( G ) must have a path of length 3, and thus there exist distinct ( x, y, z in S ) such that ( x mid yz ).

Each of these boxes needs 1 piece of tape as long as L and 2 pieces as long as S. So, for each box, Brian uses L + 2S inches of tape. Since there are 5 such boxes, the total tape used for these boxes is 5(L + 2S). The 2 boxes that are 40 inches square need 3 pieces of tape each, all 40 inches long. So, for each of these boxes, Brian uses 3 * 40 inches of tape. Since there are 2 such boxes, the total tape used for these boxes is 2 * 3 * 40 = 240 inches. We know that Brian needs 540 inches of tape in total. So, the tape used for the 5 boxes and the 2 square boxes together is 540 inches.

The product of consecutive even integers from 2 to 134 is: 2 * 4 * 6 * 8 * ... * 132 * 134 This product is essentially the product of all even numbers up to 134. Since every even number is divisible by 2, we can factor out a 2 from each term: 2^(67) * (1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * ... * 66 * 67) Now, the product inside the parentheses is the factorial of 67, denoted as 67!. So the product is: 2^(67) * 67! The number that the product must be divisible by is the smallest number that divides this product without a remainder. Since the product includes a factorial, it will be divisible by every number up to 67. Additionally, because we have 67 factors of 2, the product will also be divisible by any power of 2 up to 2^(67). Therefore, the smallest number that the product must be divisible by is 1, as any number is divisible by 1. However, if we are looking for the smallest non-trivial divisor (greater than 1), it would be 2, since the product is guaranteed to be even due to the presence of multiple factors of 2.

Therefore, proposition A is correct. --- **For B:** Let's evaluate this proposition with a specific example. - Choosing alpha =frac{π}{12}. - Calculate cos2α = cos(2 times frac{π}{12}) = cos(frac{π}{6}). - Knowing cos(frac{π}{6}) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, which is greater than 0. Hence, proposition B is correct since there exists at least one alpha for which cos 2alpha gt 0. --- **For C:** We will evaluate the trigonometric identity involved. - Given sin alpha =frac{3}{5}. - Using the Pythagorean identity, sin^2 alpha + cos^2 alpha = 1. - Substituting sin alpha =frac{3}{5}, we get (frac{3}{5})^2 + cos^2 alpha = 1. - Simplifying, cos^2 alpha = 1 - (frac{3}{5})^2 = 1 - frac{9}{25} = frac{16}{25}. - Thus, cos alpha = pm frac{4}{5}.

However, the correct calculation of the area should involve the formula for the sector's area without directly substituting the arc length for the radius in the formula. The correct approach should involve calculating the area based on the central angle and the radius directly derived from the relationship between the arc length and the central angle, leading to a different result.

Let this base number be 1 student for simplicity. Therefore, there are 3 times 1 = 3 students in the sixth grade and 4 times 1 = 4 students in the seventh grade. The difference in the number of students between seventh and sixth grades can be found by subtracting the number of sixth-grade students from the number of seventh-grade students, which is 4 - 3 = 1. However, since the ratio represents more than a single student difference, we must consider the ratio itself to determine the actual difference. The sixth grade has fewer students than the seventh grade by the difference between 4 times the base number and 3 times the base number.

We start with the given ratio of angle A:angle B=7:2. This means that for every 7 parts that angle A has, angle B has 2 parts. 2. In a quadrilateral, the sum of the angles is always 360^{circ}. However, the solution seems to imply a misunderstanding by stating angle A + angle B = 180^{circ}. This is not correct for the sum of angles in a quadrilateral but rather applies to the sum of angles in a triangle or the supplementary nature of angles in a cyclic quadrilateral. The correct approach, assuming the intent was to discuss angles on a straight line or supplementary angles (which might be the case in a cyclic quadrilateral or when considering opposite angles), would be to clarify the context. However, sticking closely to the provided solution and correcting the misunderstanding: - Since angle A and angle B are not directly given to sum to 180^{circ} in a general quadrilateral, we'll proceed under the assumption that there's a specific condition (like ABCD being a cyclic quadrilateral) making angle A + angle B = 180^{circ} valid. This would mean angle A and angle B are supplementary if they are consecutive angles or equal if they are opposite angles in such a special quadrilateral case. 3. Given the ratio angle A:angle B = 7:2, and assuming they sum to 180^{circ} based on the provided solution, we can express angle A and angle B as follows: - Let the common ratio be x. Then, angle A = 7x and angle B = 2x. - Therefore, 7x + 2x = 180^{circ}, simplifying to 9x = 180^{circ}, which gives x = 20^{circ}. - Thus, angle A = 7x = 7(20^{circ}) = 140^{circ}. 4. The solution directly states that angle C = angle A. This implies a special property of the quadrilateral (like it being a parallelogram, rectangle, or another specific type where opposite angles are equal), which wasn't specified in the problem but is assumed based on the solution provided. 5. Therefore, following the solution's logic, angle C = 140^{circ}. Putting it all together in a step-by-step manner and correcting the initial misunderstanding about the sum of angles in a quadrilateral: angle A = 140^{circ} Since angle C = angle A (assuming a specific condition of the quadrilateral that makes this true), angle C = 140^{circ}.

Therefore, {frac{1}{a_{n} - 1}} is an arithmetic sequence with a first term of 1 and a common difference of 1.

Step 1: Understanding the Box-Addition Operations 1. Initially, Gavrila places 7 smaller boxes into a large box. 2. Glafira then fills some (but not necessarily all) of these 7 boxes with 7 even smaller boxes, and leaves others empty. 3. Gavrila then repeats this operation for the boxes that are still empty, again filling some empty boxes with 7 smaller boxes, and leaving some empty. Step 2: Determining the Effect of Each Operation Each time a box is filled with 7 smaller boxes: - The number of non-empty boxes increases by 1 because one previously empty box gets filled. - The number of empty boxes increases by 6 because each filled box now contains 7 smaller boxes, all of which start out empty (7 new empty boxes - 1 previously empty box turned non-empty). Step 3: Formulating Equations Let ( n ) be the number of iterations or the number of boxes that have been filled. After ( n ) operations: - The number of non-empty boxes = ( n ) - The number of empty boxes = ( -1 + 6n ) We start with the original empty box that eventually became non-empty. Hence, for non-empty boxes: [ text{Non-empty boxes} = n ] For empty boxes: [ text{Empty boxes} = -1 + 6n ] Step 4: Solving for ( n ) We are given that at some point, there are 34 non-empty boxes.

This function is indeed odd and meets the problem's conditions. 4. **Proving Monotonicity:** To prove f(x) is monotonically increasing on (-2,2), consider two points x_1 and x_2 such that -2 < x_1 < x_2 < 2.

Let's break down the analysis step by step. 1. **Determining the expression of f(x) based on the sign of x**: For x geq 0, we have |x|=x, leading to: f(x) = frac{x}{1+x} = 1 - frac{1}{x+1} For x < 0, we have |x|=-x, yielding: f(x) = frac{x}{1-x} = -1 - frac{1}{x-1} Thus, we can express f(x) as: f(x) = begin{cases} 1 - frac{1}{x+1} & text{for } x geq 0 -1 - frac{1}{x-1} & text{for } x < 0 end{cases} 2. **Checking if f(x) is an odd function**: Considering f(-x) = frac{-x}{1+|-x|} = -frac{x}{1+|x|} = -f(x), it's evident that f(x) is an odd function. 3. **Analyzing the behavior of f(x) for x geq 0**: When x geq 0, f(x) = 1 - frac{1}{x+1} < 1. Since the function 1 - frac{1}{x+1} is strictly increasing (as the derivative of -frac{1}{(x+1)^2} is negative), f(x) is strictly increasing on [0, +infty). 4. **Examining the behavior of f(x) for x < 0**: Since f(x) is an odd function, its behavior on (-infty, 0) mirrors its behavior on (0, +infty). Thus, f(x) is strictly increasing on (-infty, 0) as well. 5. **Checking the range of f(x)**: For x geq 0, f(x) < 1, and for x < 0, f(x) > -1. Hence, the range of f(x) is (-1, 1), confirming conclusion ① is correct. 6. **Conclusion ②**: Since f(x) is strictly increasing on mathbb{R}, for any x_1, x_2 in mathbb{R} with x_1 neq x_2, frac{f(x_1) - f(x_2)}{x_1 - x_2} > 0. Thus, conclusion ② is correct. 7. **Testing conclusion ③ with specific values**: Taking x_1 = 0 and x_2 = 1, we get f(x_1) = 0 and f(x_2) = frac{1}{2}, leading to f(frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}) = f(frac{1}{2}) = frac{1}{3}, and frac{f(x_1) + f(x_2)}{2} = frac{1}{4} < frac{1}{3}. This disproves conclusion ③. 8. **Analyzing conclusion ④ through recursion**: Given the recursive definition of f_n(x), we can derive that f_{10}(x) = frac{x}{10|x| + 1}. Substituting x = frac{1}{2}, we find f_{10}(frac{1}{2}) = frac{1}{12}, confirming conclusion ④ is correct. Therefore, the correct conclusions are ①, ②, and ④.

After including today's production, the average daily production increases to 62 units, and the total number of days considered becomes n + 1 (which is 14 + 1 = 15 days). The new total production is P + T, and the new average is: (P + T) / (n + 1) = 62 Substituting the known values, we get: (840 + T) / 15 = 62 Now, we solve for T: 840 + T = 62 * 15 840 + T = 930 T = 930 - 840 T = 90 Therefore, boxed{90} units were produced today."},{"prompt":"A goat named Bella is tethered to the corner of a rectangular 4 m by 6 m barn with a 5 m leash.

The leash extends to 5 m, and she is tethered at a corner of a 4 m by 6 m rectangular barn. **Step 1: Calculate the area Bella can graze:** Since she's tethered to the corner, the full leash length is available unless obstructed by the barn. She can move in a 270-degree arc around the barn's corner. **Step 2: Compute the area of the sector:** The area of a circle with radius 5 m is ( pi(5^2) = 25pi ) square meters.

We need to show that this AP also contains the sixth power of an integer. Let the first term of the AP be (a) and the common difference be (d). Suppose there exist integers (i) and (j) such that (a + id = x^2) and (a + jd = y^3), where (x) and (y) are integers. This implies: [ x^2 equiv y^3 equiv a pmod{d} ] Let (gcd(a, d) = m). Then we can write (a = mr) and (d = ms) where (gcd(r, s) = 1). We will prove the conclusion by induction on (d). # Base Case: (d = 1) If (d = 1), the sequence contains all integers (geq a). Since it contains all integers, it will certainly contain the sixth power of an integer. This case is trivial. # Inductive Step Assume the statement is true for all (d' < d). We need to show it is true for (d). 1. **Case 1: (gcd(m, s) = 1)** - Since (gcd(m, s) = 1), we have (gcd(a, s) = 1). This implies (gcd(x, s) = 1) and (gcd(y, s) = 1). - There exists an integer (n) such that (ny equiv x pmod{s}). Therefore: [ n^6 y^6 equiv x^6 pmod{s} ] - Since (x^6 equiv a pmod{s}) and (gcd(a, s) = 1), we get: [ n^6 equiv a pmod{s} ] - Also, since (gcd(m, s) = 1), there exists an integer (k) such that: [ ks equiv -n pmod{m} ] - Then: [ (n + ks)^6 equiv 0 equiv a pmod{m} ] [ (n + ks)^6 equiv n^6 equiv a pmod{s} ] - Since (gcd(m, s) = 1) and (d = ms), we get: [ (n + ks)^6 equiv a pmod{d} ] - We can increase (k) by a large multiple of (m) to make (n + ks > a). Therefore, ((n + ks)^6) is in the sequence. 2. **Case 2: (gcd(m, s) > 1)** - Let (p) be a common prime factor of (m) and (s). Since (a = mr), (d = ms), and (gcd(r, s) = 1), the exponent (beta) of (p) in the prime factorization of (d) is greater than the exponent (alpha) of (p) in the prime factorization of (a), i.e., (beta > alpha geq 1). - Then (p^{alpha} mid a) and (p^{beta} mid d). Now (alpha < beta) implies every term is divisible by (p^{alpha}), but not by (p^{alpha+1}). - In particular, (p^{alpha} parallel x^2, y^3) implies (alpha) is a multiple of (6).

Also, log_9 b = frac{1}{2}log_3 b because log_b a = frac{1}{log_a b} and 9 = 3^2. Therefore, the given equation becomes: [ -log_3 a + frac{1}{2}log_3 b = 0 ] Rearranging, we get: [ log_3 b = 2log_3 a = log_3 a^2 ] This implies that b = a^2 given that a, b > 0.

(ii) ( G ) contains a normal subgroup of order ( m ). We are given that ( G ) contains an element of order ( 2^n ). # Proof for (i) ( G ) is not simple: 1. **Existence of a Composition Series:** Since ( G ) is a finite group, it has a composition series: [ G_0 triangleleft G_1 triangleleft cdots triangleleft G_n = G ] where each ( G_{i+1}/G_i ) is a simple group. Given the order of ( G ) is ( 2^n m ), we can construct a series where ( |G_0| = m ) and ( G_{i+1}/G_i cong mathbb{Z}_2 ). 2. **Induction Hypothesis:** We will use induction to show that ( G_0 triangleleft G_k implies G_0 triangleleft G_{k+1} ). Assume ( G_0 ) is the only subgroup of order ( m ) in ( G_k ). 3. **Conjugation Argument:** Since ( G_k triangleleft G_{k+1} ), conjugation of ( G_0 ) by an element of ( G_{k+1} ) would bring ( G_0 ) to a subgroup of order ( m ) in ( G_k ). By the induction hypothesis, ( G_0 ) is the only subgroup of order ( m ), so ( G_0 ) must be normal in ( G_{k+1} ). 4. **Uniqueness of Subgroup of Order ( m ):** To show ( G_0 ) is the only subgroup of order ( m ) in ( G_k ), we mimic the proof of Sylow's theorems. Let ( H ) be a subgroup of ( G_k ) of order ( m ). ( H ) acts on ( G_k/G_0 ) by left multiplication. The stabilizers are of the form ( H cap H_0 ) where ( H_0 ) is a conjugate of ( G_0 ). Since ( G_0 ) is normal in ( G_k ), ( H_0 = G_0 ), so the stabilizer is ( H cap G_0 ), which is constant. 5. **Orbit-Stabilizer Theorem:** By the orbit-stabilizer theorem, the size of the orbits must all be the same and must divide ( m ). Since ( m ) is odd and does not divide ( 2^n ), the size of the orbits must be 1. Hence, ( H = G_0 ), and ( G_0 ) is the only subgroup of order ( m ) in ( G_k ). 6. **Conclusion for Simplicity:** Since ( G ) has a normal subgroup ( G_0 ) of order ( m ), ( G ) cannot be simple. # Proof for (ii) ( G ) contains a normal subgroup of order ( m ): 1. **Normal Subgroup of Order ( m ):** From the above argument, we have shown that ( G_0 ) is a normal subgroup of ( G ) and ( |G_0| = m ). 2. **Conclusion:** Therefore, ( G ) contains a normal subgroup of order ( m ).

Here, the function of n is linear in nature because the formula can be simplified to: [ a_n = a_1 + d cdot n - d = d cdot n + (a_1 - d) ] This is a linear equation in n. 2. **Geometric Progression (GP)**: The n-th term of a geometric progression is given by the formula: [ a_n = a_1 cdot r^{(n-1)} ] where a_1 is the first term and r is the common ratio. Here, the function of n is exponential in nature because we have r raised to the power of (n-1). This can be written as: [ a_n = a_1 cdot r cdot r^{(n-2)} = (a_1 cdot r) cdot r^{(n-2)} ] and thus, we recognize it as an exponential function with the base r. In conclusion: - The n-th term of an arithmetic progression is described by a linear function of n. - The n-th term of a geometric progression is described by an exponential function of n.

Then the speed from the grocery to the gym is ( 2v ) meters per second, since it's double the initial speed.

So, the time from home to the grocery, ( t_1 ), is given by: [ t_1 = frac{1200}{v} ] The time from the grocery to the gym, ( t_2 ), is given by: [ t_2 = frac{480}{2v} ] Since she spent 40 seconds less on her way from the grocery to the gym, we can write: [ t_1 - t_2 = 40 ] Substituting the expressions for ( t_1 ) and ( t_2 ) into the equation, we get: [ frac{1200}{v} - frac{480}{2v} = 40 ] To solve for ( v ), we first simplify the equation by finding a common denominator, which is ( 2v ): [ frac{2400}{2v} - frac{480}{2v} = 40 ] Now, subtract the fractions: [ frac{2400 - 480}{2v} = 40 ] Simplify the numerator: [ frac{1920}{2v} = 40 ] Multiply both sides by ( 2v ) to get rid of the denominator: [ 1920 = 80v ] Now, divide both sides by 80 to solve for ( v ): [ v = frac{1920}{80} ] [ v = 24 ] So, Angelina's speed from home to the grocery was 24 meters per second.

Hamster has grown tired of losing every time, so he decides to cheat. He looks at the piles beforehand and rearranges the k cards in each pile as he pleases. When can Hamster perform this procedure such that he will win the game? *Brian Hamrick.*","completion":"1. **Lemma**: A directed multiedged graph mathfrak{G} is called *shifu* if it has the following properties: - For each vertex u in V_{mathfrak{G}}, we have text{Indegree}[u] = text{Outdegree}[u]. - There are no edges from u to itself. (Though there might be multiple edges from u to v, where u neq v). Then mathfrak{G} contains an Eulerian Circuit if and only if it is connected (in the sense that if you now treat mathfrak{G} as undirected, then you can go from any vertex to another commuting through edges). 2. **Proof of Lemma**: This is well known. One implication is trivial - if it's not connected, then it clearly doesn't have any Eulerian Circuit. We prove the other implication, that if it's connected then it has a circuit. We proceed by induction on the number of edges, base case |E_{mathfrak{G}}| = 2 is trivial. Now pick any vertex u in mathfrak{G} then pick two vertices v, w such that vec{vu} and vec{uw} exist. Consider the graph mathfrak{G'} obtained by taking mathfrak{G}, deleting vec{vu} and vec{uw} and adding vec{vw}. (Now if in mathfrak{G'}, the vertex u is disconnected, then change mathfrak{G'} to mathfrak{G'} - u, otherwise do nothing). In either way, mathfrak{G'} is now *shifu*, and has one edge less than mathfrak{G}, so by induction it has an Eulerian circuit mathfrak{C'}. Now create mathfrak{C} from mathfrak{C'} by changing the cdots rightarrow vec{vw} rightarrow cdots in mathfrak{C'} to cdots vec{vu} rightarrow vec{uw} rightarrow cdots. Clearly, mathfrak{C} is an Eulerian circuit in mathfrak{G}, so we're done. 3. **Claim**: The configuration is winnable if and only if it's irreducible. 4. **Proof of Claim**: Firstly in this distribution, for each 1 leq i leq n call a card appearing on i-th pile *useless* if it has the value *i* on it, and suppose i-th pile has 0 leq m_i leq k useless cards. If on any rearrangement, if we operate on any useless card on a pile, we operate on that pile again, so taking away all the useless cards from each pile doesn't change the outcome of the game. So we remove all the useless cards. 5. Now after removing, note that for each i, [ text{Number of cards on i-th pile} = k - m_i = text{Total number of cards marked i on other piles}. ] So we create a directed graph mathfrak{G} with n vertices v_1, cdots, v_n, with the number of vec{v_iv_j} edges equal to the number of cards marked with the number j on i-th pile. 6. Then [ text{Indegree}[v_i] = text{Total number of cards marked i on other piles} = k - m_i = text{Number of cards in i-th pile} = text{Outdegree}[v_i], ] so mathfrak{G} is shifu! 7. Now note two things: mathfrak{G} is connected (in the sense mentioned in the lemma) if and only if the distribution is irreducible, and if the distribution is reducible, then we can't clearly win (because we then can never operate on any card in some piles). So suppose the configuration is irreducible, i.e., mathfrak{G} is connected. Then by **Lemma**, it has an Eulerian Circuit mathfrak{C}. Since it's a circuit which starts and ends at the same vertex, we can WLOG choose that vertex to be v_1, so the circuit is like vec{v_1v_i} rightarrow vec{v_iv_j} rightarrow cdots vec{v_1v_m} cdots vec{v_pv_q} rightarrow vec{v_qv_1}. 8. Now we construct the desired permutation from the circuit. Initially, all the piles are empty. Now first add a card marked 1 to q-th pile, then add a card marked p to q-th pile, and commute the circuit backward like this and when you encounter v_kv_l add a card marked l to k-th pile on top of what is already there. Then add all the useless cards back. By the properties of the circuit, it's easy to see this construction works. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given a sequence {a_n}, for any k in mathbb{N}^*, when n = 3k, a_n = a_{frac{n}{3}}; when n neq 3k, a_n = n.

To work with these values, we search for natural numbers ( m ) and ( n ) that satisfy the equations [ p = frac{m+n}{m} quad text{and} quad q = frac{m+n}{n}. ] We can verify: [ frac{1}{p} = frac{m}{m+n} quad text{and} quad frac{1}{q} = frac{n}{m+n}. ] Adding these, [ frac{m}{m+n} + frac{n}{m+n} = frac{m+n}{m+n} = 1, ] confirming the initial condition. 3. Next, perform the substitutions ( alpha = a^{1/m} ) and ( beta = b^{1/n} ). The desired inequality [ ab leq frac{a^p}{p} + frac{b^q}{q} ] transforms into [ frac{m alpha^{m+n} + n beta^{m+n}}{m+n} geq alpha^m beta^n. ] 4. We employ the arithmetic-mean geometric-mean inequality (AM-GM inequality), which states: [ frac{x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_r}{r} geq sqrt[r]{x_1 x_2 cdots x_r}. ] Applying this to our case, let ( x_1 = m alpha^{m+n} ) and ( x_2 = n beta^{m+n} ), we get: [ frac{m alpha^{m+n} + n beta^{m+n}}{m+n} geq sqrt[m+n]{left( m alpha^{m+n} right)^{frac{m+n}{m+n}} left( n beta^{m+n} right)^{frac{m+n}{m+n}}}. ] Simplifying the right-hand side, [ sqrt[m+n]{(m alpha^{m+n})(n beta^{m+n})} = sqrt[m+n]{m alpha^{m+n} cdot n beta^{m+n}} = sqrt[m+n]{m cdot n cdot alpha^{m+n} cdot beta^{m+n}}. ] Simplifying further, [ sqrt[m+n]{mn (alpha beta)^{m+n}} = sqrt[m+n]{mn} cdot (alpha beta)^{ (m+n)/(m+n) } = mn cdot alpha^{m} beta^{n}. ] 5. Noting that the presence of (m) and (n) in the above step overestimates the proof, a correct use of the AM-GM inequality simplifies to: [ sqrt[m+n]{left(alpha^{m+n}right)^m left(beta^{m+n}right)^n} = alpha^{m} beta^{n}. ] Conclusion: Thus, we have shown that [ frac{m alpha^{m+n} + n beta^{m+n}}{m+n} geq alpha^{m} beta^{n}, ] which is equivalent to [ ab leq frac{a^p}{p} + frac{b^q}{q}. ] Therefore, the inequality holds as given.

The perimeter P of a rectangle is given by the formula: P = 2L + 2W We are given that P = 46 cm, so we can write: 2L + 2W = 46 Divide both sides by 2 to simplify: L + W = 23 Now, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to relate the length, width, and diagonal of the rectangle, since the diagonal forms a right triangle with the length and width. The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. In this case, the hypotenuse is the diagonal of the rectangle, which is 17 cm.

We start by rewriting the given expression in a more convenient form. Suppose ( a ) and ( b ) are positive integers. We need to show that [ left( a + frac{1}{2} right)^n + left( b + frac{1}{2} right)^n ] is an integer for only finitely many positive integers ( n ). 2. Consider the expression: [ left( a + frac{1}{2} right)^n + left( b + frac{1}{2} right)^n = frac{(2a + 1)^n + (2b + 1)^n}{2^n} ] Let ( A = 2a + 1 ) and ( B = 2b + 1 ). Then the expression becomes: [ frac{A^n + B^n}{2^n} ] We need to determine when this expression is an integer. 3. For the expression (frac{A^n + B^n}{2^n}) to be an integer, ( A^n + B^n ) must be divisible by ( 2^n ). 4. Consider the parity of ( A ) and ( B ). Since ( A = 2a + 1 ) and ( B = 2b + 1 ), both ( A ) and ( B ) are odd integers. 5. If ( n geq 2 ), we need to analyze the divisibility of ( A^n + B^n ) by ( 2^n ). 6. First, consider the case when ( n ) is even. If ( n ) is even, say ( n = 2k ), then: [ A^n + B^n = A^{2k} + B^{2k} ] Since ( A ) and ( B ) are odd, ( A equiv 1 pmod{2} ) and ( B equiv 1 pmod{2} ). Therefore: [ A^{2k} equiv 1 pmod{4} quad text{and} quad B^{2k} equiv 1 pmod{4} ] Thus: [ A^{2k} + B^{2k} equiv 1 + 1 = 2 pmod{4} ] This implies that ( A^{2k} + B^{2k} ) is not divisible by ( 4 ), and hence not divisible by ( 2^n ) for ( n geq 2 ). Therefore, ( frac{A^n + B^n}{2^n} ) is not an integer when ( n ) is even and ( n geq 2 ). 7. Now consider the case when ( n ) is odd. If ( n ) is odd, say ( n = 2k + 1 ), then: [ A^n + B^n = A^{2k+1} + B^{2k+1} ] We can factorize ( A^n + B^n ) as: [ A^{2k+1} + B^{2k+1} = (A + B)(A^{2k} - A^{2k-1}B + A^{2k-2}B^2 - cdots + B^{2k}) ] Since ( A ) and ( B ) are odd, ( A + B ) is even. Let ( A + B = 2m ) for some integer ( m ). Then: [ A^{2k+1} + B^{2k+1} = 2m cdot (A^{2k} - A^{2k-1}B + A^{2k-2}B^2 - cdots + B^{2k}) ] The term ( (A^{2k} - A^{2k-1}B + A^{2k-2}B^2 - cdots + B^{2k}) ) is a sum of odd terms, hence it is odd. Therefore, ( A^{2k+1} + B^{2k+1} ) is divisible by ( 2 ) but not necessarily by ( 2^n ). 8. For ( frac{A^n + B^n}{2^n} ) to be an integer, ( A^n + B^n ) must be divisible by ( 2^n ).

How many candies do we have if the number of possible different distributions in this way is exactly one more than the number of candies?","completion":"The problem is rephrased into mathematical language as follows: we need to partition the integer ( n ) into three distinct positive integers. We need to determine for which ( n ) the number of such partitions is exactly one greater than ( n ). To better understand the solution, let's examine it in a structured manner: 1. **Partition ( n ) into Three Distinct Positive Integers**: We translate the given condition into: - ( n = a + b + c ) where ( a, b, c ) are distinct positive integers (( a < b < c )). 2. **Number of Partitions Formula**: The number of ways to partition ( n ) into three distinct parts is given by: [ binom{n-1}{2} = frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} ] This represents choosing 2 positions out of ( n-1 ) for the dividers in a lineup of ( n ) candies. 3. **Number of Redundant Partitions**: We need to subtract the cases where two parts are equal (which we shouldn't count): - If two parts ( k ) are identical, then: [ (k, k, n-2k) quad text{or}quad (k, n-2k, k) quad text{or} quad (n-2k, k, k) ] These count as 3 duplicate cases. Additionally, if ( n = 3k ), there's a case where all parts are equal: [ (k, k, k) ] 4. **Equation Setup**: We need the count of valid partitions to be ( n+1 ). Thus, we subtract out the invalid (duplicate/multiplicative) cases and set the proper equation for each condition. # Cases: Case 1: ( n ) is even and not divisible by 3: - Total partitions: [ binom{n-1}{2} = frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} ] - Subtracting duplicate counts (two parts repeated, ( leq frac{n}{2}-1 ) such pairs): [ 3 left( frac{n}{2} - 1 right) ] - Final equation to solve: [ frac{frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} - 3left(frac{n}{2}-1right)}{6} = n+1 ] Simplifying, we get: [ n^2 - 18n - 4 = 0 ] This gives no integer solution. Case 2: ( n ) is even and divisible by 3: - Similar is done, but account for the extra condition when ( n = 3k ): [ frac{frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} - 3left(frac{n}{2}-2right) - 1}{6} = n+1 ] Simplifying, we get: [ n^2 - 18n = 0 ] This equation provides: [ n = 18 ] Case 3: ( n ) is odd and not divisible by 3: - Total: [ frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} ] - Subtracting figures: [ 3 left( frac{n-1}{2} right) ] - Equation becomes: [ frac{frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} - 3left(frac{n-1}{2}right)}{6} = n+1 ] Simplifies to: [ n^2 - 18n - 7 = 0 ] No integer solutions.

Since ( P(x) ) is a polynomial with integer coefficients, we can write: [ P(x) = Q(x) (x - a) + b ] for some polynomial ( Q(x) ) with integer coefficients. 3. **Evaluate at ( x = b )**: Substitute ( x = b ) in the polynomial: [ P(b) = Q(b) (b - a) + b ] Given that ( P(b) = c ), we have: [ c = Q(b) (b - a) + b ] Rearranging this, we get: [ c - b = Q(b) (b - a) ] 4. **Consider ( P(b) - c )**: Similarly, we know ( P(b) - c = 0 ), hence we can write: [ P(x) = R(x) (x - b) + c ] for some polynomial ( R(x) ) with integer coefficients. 5. **Evaluate at ( x = c )**: Substitute ( x = c ) in the polynomial: [ P(c) = R(c) (c - b) + c ] Given that ( P(c) = a ), we have: [ a = R(c) (c - b) + c ] Rearranging this, we get: [ a - c = R(c) (c - b) ] 6. **Consider ( P(c) - a )**: Similarly, we know ( P(c) - a = 0 ), hence we can write: [ P(x) = S(x) (x - c) + a ] for some polynomial ( S(x) ) with integer coefficients. 7. **Evaluate at ( x = a )**: Substitute ( x = a ) in the polynomial: [ P(a) = S(a) (a - c) + a ] Given that ( P(a) = b ), we have: [ b = S(a) (a - c) + a ] Rearranging this, we get: [ b - a = S(a) (a - c) ] 8. **Analyze Contradiction**: From the steps above, we have the following equalities: [ c - b = Q(b) (b - a) ] [ a - c = R(c) (c - b) ] [ b - a = S(a) (a - c) ] Notice that the products on the right-hand sides are (Q(b) (b - a)), (R(c) (c - b)), and (S(a) (a - c)), each of which must be an integer because (Q(b)), (R(c)), and (S(a)) are integers. But the sums on the left-hand sides (c - b), (a - c), and (b - a), if taken in cycle, lead to an inconsistency. Specifically, adding the left-hand sides yields (0): [ (c - b) + (a - c) + (b - a) = 0 ] Meanwhile, the right-hand sides are polynomials multiplied by non-zero differences of (a, b,) and (c). If these factors (b-a), (c-b), (a-c) are distinct non-zero integers, then the product of these differences cannot balance the equation (0). This logical inconsistency implies that our initial assumption, that there exists a polynomial ( P(x) ) with integer coefficients satisfying these conditions, must be false. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{There does not exist a polynomial } P text{ with integer coefficients such that } P(a) = b, P(b) = c, text{ and } P(c) = a text{ for distinct integers } a, b, text{ and } c.} ]"},{"prompt":"You have a certain number of gold coins that you intend to distribute equally among your 12 best friends.

It turned out that any two numbers differing by 3 are in cells adjacent by side. Is it true that there will necessarily be two corner cells such that the difference of the numbers in those cells is divisible by 6? (O. Podlipskiy)","completion":"1. **Define the Problem and Setup:** Consider a ( 9 times 9 ) table with natural numbers from 1 to 81 such that each number appears exactly once and any two numbers differing by 3 are placed in adjacent cells. We need to determine if necessarily there exist two corner cells such that the difference of the numbers in these cells is divisible by 6. 2. **Use the Pigeonhole Principle:** Examine the remainders of the numbers in the four corner cells when divided by 3. Let these corner numbers be (a), (b), (c), and (d). By the Pigeonhole Principle, among numbers (1) to (81), there are only 3 possible remainders upon division by 3 (0, 1, and 2). Thus, at least two of these corner numbers must have the same remainder when divided by 3. Suppose (a) and (b) have the same remainder. Then, (a equiv b pmod{3}) implies (a - b) is divisible by 3. 3. **Chessboard Coloring Argument:** Color the (9 times 9) grid in a chessboard pattern so that the four corners are black cells. This means that any two adjacent cells (which must differ by 3) are of different colors (one black and one white). If we consider any subset of numbers ({x, x+3, x+6, ldots, y-3, y}), all numbers in this sequence must alternate colors. 4. **Identify Evenness:** Notice that in the chessboard coloring, the numbers in black cells and white cells alternate. Therefore, any number differing by 3 (and thus always next to another) spread throughout the table will be alternating between black and white cells. Since (x) and (y) are corners and both are black (w.l.o.g), the path between (x) and (y) must be of even length. Similarly, shifting by 3 (going down one row or to the next column) alternates color, hence ({x, x+3, x+6, ... , y-3, y}) primarily depends on evenness or oddness in step size. 5. **Conclusion on Evenness in Difference:** Given that (y) and (x) are in black cells, and cells alternate in increments of 1 step horizontal/vertical changes which are steps of 3. The setup ensures any path from one corner to another consists of an even number of steps. That ensures (y-x) will be an even number. Since both share a common modulo (3), (y-x) modulo both (3) and (2) implies it is divisible by (6). # Final Conclusion: Thus, there will necessarily be two corner cells in the (9 times 9) table such that the difference of the numbers in these cells is divisible by 6.

The distance from a point (x_0, y_0) to the line Ax + By + C = 0 is given by: frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}} Using the point (1, 1) and the line 2x - y + 4 = 0, we can calculate the radius as follows: r = frac{|2 cdot 1 - 1 + 4|}{sqrt{2^2 + (-1)^2}} r = frac{|2 - 1 + 4|}{sqrt{4 + 1}} r = frac{5}{sqrt{5}} r = sqrt{5} Thus, the standard equation of the circle with center (1, 1) and radius sqrt{5} is: (x - 1)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = (sqrt{5})^2 (x - 1)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 5 Therefore, the correct answer is: boxed{(x - 1)^2 + (y - 1)^2 = 5} Selection: A.

For the line (m+1)x+y-2=0, the slope is given by rearranging the equation in the form of y=mx+b. From here, the slope k_1 is the coefficient of x when y is isolated, which yields: y = - (m+1) x + 2 implies k_1 = - (m + 1) For the line mx+(2m+2)y+1=0, similarly finding the slope k_2 requires rearranging to solve for y: (2m+2)y = -mx - 1 implies y = -frac{mx}{2m+2} - frac{1}{2m+2} k_2 = -frac{m}{2m+2} = -frac{1}{2} For the lines to be perpendicular, their slopes must satisfy k_1 cdot k_2 = -1. Substituting k_1 and k_2 into this equation, we get: (- (m + 1)) cdot left(-frac{1}{2}right) = -1 implies frac{m + 1}{2} = 1 implies m + 1 = 2 implies m = 1 However, this contradicts our initial statement that m=-2. The correct approach is to equate the product of the slopes to -1 knowing k_2 = -frac{1}{2}: k_1 cdot left(-frac{1}{2}right) = -1 - (m + 1) cdot left(-frac{1}{2}right) = -1 frac{m + 1}{2} = -1 m + 1 = -2 m = -3 As it stands, we find that there is an oversight in the initial solution as we correctly derive m = -3. However, the question explicitly states to consider the condition m = -2. Therefore, let's examine what happens when m = -2: For m = -2, the equation of the first line becomes (-2+1)x + y - 2 = 0 implies (-1)x + y - 2 = 0, which simplifies to y = x + 2. This gives us a slope of k_1 = 1. For the second line (-2)x + (2cdot(-2) + 2)y + 1 = 0 implies -2x - 2y + 1 = 0, this simplifies to y = -x - frac{1}{2}. Therefore, we have a slope of k_2 = -1. We see that with m = -2, the slopes of the two lines are indeed negative reciprocals of each other (1 cdot -1 = -1), meaning the lines are perpendicular. We additionally check the condition when one slope does not exist. If m+1 = 0, then m = -1, but the question is asking if \\"m=-2\\" is a condition, so \\"m=-1\\" is not relevant to this specific case. Thus, \\"m=-2\\" is a sufficient condition for the lines to be perpendicular because it's one specific value that ensures perpendicularly.

Since x and z are both less than or equal to 2, their sum cannot be greater than 4, and their product cannot be greater than 4 either. Therefore, addition and multiplication are not the operations we are looking for, as they could never result in a number as large as 33. However, if we consider subtraction or division, we need to find a scenario where the result could not be 33. Since x and z are both less than or equal to 2, subtracting one from the other would give a result less than or equal to 2, which is far from 33. For division, if we divide x by z or z by x, the result would be a fraction or a number less than or equal to 1 (since both x and z are less than or equal to 2 and we are dividing a smaller number by a larger number or the same number by itself). Therefore, the operation involving x and z that could not equal boxed{33} is either subtraction (x - z or z - x) or division (x / z or z / x)."},{"prompt":"Point M lies inside triangle ABC .

Similarly, define ( S(B, BM) ) and ( S(C, CM) ) as the regions inside the circles with centers ( B ) and ( C ) and radii ( BM ) and ( CM ), respectively. 3. **Intersection of regions**: The point ( N ) must lie in the intersection of the three regions ( S(A, AM) ), ( S(B, BM) ), and ( S(C, CM) ). Mathematically, this can be written as: [ N in S(A, AM) cap S(B, BM) cap S(C, CM) ] 4. **Contradiction**: Since ( M ) is the only point that satisfies ( AN = AM ), ( BN = BM ), and ( CN = CM ) simultaneously, the intersection of the three regions ( S(A, AM) ), ( S(B, BM) ), and ( S(C, CM) ) must be the point ( M ) itself. Therefore, ( N ) must be ( M ), which contradicts the assumption that ( N ) is a different point inside triangle ( ABC ). 5. **Conclusion**: Hence, our assumption that there exists a point ( N ) such that ( AN leq AM ), ( BN leq BM ), and ( CN leq CM ) is false.

For S_{11} > 0 and S_{12} < 0, we can deduce that the sum of the sequence changes sign between the 11th and 12th terms. This implies that the 12th term must be negative and sufficiently large in magnitude to make the sum of the first 12 terms negative. 2. **From S_{11} > 0 and S_{12} < 0, deducing a_6 and a_7:** We can express S_{11} and S_{12} in terms of the middle terms because the sum of an arithmetic sequence is symmetric around its middle term(s). Thus, S_{11} = 11a_6 > 0 and S_{12} = 12a_6 + d < 0. From these, we deduce: - a_6 > 0 because 11a_6 > 0. - a_6 + a_7 < 0 because a_7 = a_6 + d and 12a_6 + d < 0. Therefore, we have a_6 > 0 and a_7 < 0. Since a_7 is negative and a_6 is positive, it follows that d < 0 (the sequence is decreasing). 3. **Analyzing the statements:** - **A: d < 0** is correct because we have established that the sequence is decreasing. - **B: a_7 > 0** is incorrect because we found a_7 < 0. - **C: S_6 is the largest in {S_n}** is correct. Since a_6 > 0 and a_7 < 0 with d < 0, the sequence is decreasing, and S_6 represents the sum before the sequence starts to include negative terms, making it the largest sum before the total sum begins to decrease. - **D: |a_4| > |a_9|** is incorrect. Since a_4 + a_9 = 2a_6 + d < 0 and a_4 > 0, a_9 < 0, it implies that |a_4| < |a_9| because a_9 is further from zero in a decreasing sequence.

Let's go through the steps. 1. **Introduction of Errors by the Vandal:** - Each day, the Vandal introduces one new error into the article. 2. **Error Removal Probability by the Moderator:** - At the end of each day, the moderator checks the article and has a (frac{2}{3}) chance of catching any individual error that is still in the article. - Conversely, there is a probability of (frac{1}{3}) that the moderator misses an error. 3. **Probability Analysis:** - For an error introduced on Day 1, it will have 3 opportunities to be caught (at the end of each day for the next 3 days). The probability that this error is not caught on a given day is (frac{1}{3}). Therefore, the probability that this error is not caught in all three checks is: [ left( frac{1}{3} right)^3 = frac{1}{27} ] Hence, the probability that this specific error is caught at least once during the three days is: [ 1 - frac{1}{27} = frac{26}{27} ] - For an error introduced on Day 2, it will have 2 opportunities to be caught. Thus, the probability that this error is not caught in both checks is: [ left( frac{1}{3} right)^2 = frac{1}{9} ] The probability that this error is caught at least once during the two days is: [ 1 - frac{1}{9} = frac{8}{9} ] - For an error introduced on Day 3, it will have 1 opportunity to be caught. The probability that it misses the check is: [ frac{1}{3} ] The probability that this error is caught is: [ 1 - frac{1}{3} = frac{2}{3} ] 4. **Combining Probabilities:** Assume the events of catching each error are independent.

The match continues until one player has won exactly two more games than the other player. We can break down the scenarios after the first two games into two main cases: 1. **Tim wins both games or Allen wins both games:** - This will end the match immediately after exactly 2 games. - The probability that one player wins both games is: [ P(text{same player wins both games}) = P(text{Tim wins twice}) + P(text{Allen wins twice}) = left(frac{3}{4}right)^2 + left(frac{1}{4}right)^2 = frac{9}{16} + frac{1}{16} = frac{10}{16} = frac{5}{8} ] - The expected number of games in this case is exactly 2. 2. **Tim and Allen each win one game:** - This resets the situation to the original but with two extra games played. - The probability that they each win one game is: [ P(text{each wins one game}) = 1 - P(text{same player wins both games}) = 1 - frac{5}{8} = frac{3}{8} ] - Therefore, the expected number of additional games (starting from scratch again) is (E), but we've already played 2 games.

Two vertices (rows) are connected by an edge if the rows become identical when a specific column is removed. Each edge is colored by the index of the column that, when removed, makes the two rows identical. 2. **Assume the Contrary:** Assume that it is not possible to remove any column such that the rows in the new table are still distinct. This implies that for every column ( i ), there exists at least one pair of rows that become identical when column ( i ) is removed. Hence, there is at least one edge of each color ( 1, 2, ldots, n ) in the graph ( G ). 3. **Construct a Subgraph:** Pick one edge of each color. This gives us ( n ) edges, each of a different color. Let ( G' ) be the subgraph formed by these ( n ) edges. 4. **Analyze the Subgraph:** Since ( G' ) has ( n ) edges and ( n ) vertices, it must contain a cycle (by the Pigeonhole Principle and the fact that a tree with ( n ) vertices has ( n-1 ) edges). 5. **Contradiction:** A cycle in ( G' ) implies that there is a sequence of rows and columns such that removing the corresponding columns makes the rows identical in a cyclic manner. However, this contradicts our assumption that each edge has a unique color (column index). In a cycle, at least one column would have to be removed more than once, which is impossible since each edge in ( G' ) is uniquely colored. 6. **Conclusion:** Therefore, our initial assumption must be false.

Only ( m equiv 1 pmod{3} ) satisfies: [ m^3 equiv 1 pmod{3} ] Thus, we can write ( m ) as: [ m = 3k + 1 quad text{for some integer } k ] 5. **Substitute ( m = 3k + 1 ) back into the original equation:** Substitute ( m = 3k + 1 ) into the original equation: [ (3k + 1)^3 = 3n^2 + 3n + 7 ] Expand the left-hand side: [ (3k + 1)^3 = (3k)^3 + 3 cdot (3k)^2 cdot 1 + 3 cdot (3k) cdot 1^2 + 1^3 ] Simplifying: [ (3k + 1)^3 = 27k^3 + 27k^2 + 9k + 1 ] Hence, we have: [ 27k^3 + 27k^2 + 9k + 1 = 3n^2 + 3n + 7 ] 6. **Re-arrange and simplify the equation:** Collect terms involving multiples of 3 on one side, and constants on the other: [ 27k^3 + 27k^2 + 9k = 3n^2 + 3n + 6 ] Divide the entire equation by 3: [ 9k^3 + 9k^2 + 3k = n^2 + n + 2 ] 7. **Check if ( n^2 + n + 2 ) is divisible by 3:** Notice that for any integer ( n ): - If ( n equiv 0 pmod{3} ): [ n^2 + n + 2 equiv 0 + 0 + 2 equiv 2 pmod{3} ] - If ( n equiv 1 pmod{3} ): [ n^2 + n + 2 equiv 1 + 1 + 2 equiv 4 equiv 1 pmod{3} ] - If ( n equiv 2 pmod{3} ): [ n^2 + n + 2 equiv 4 + 2 + 2 equiv 8 equiv 2 pmod{3} ] Since ( n^2 + n + 2 ) can be 1 or 2 modulo 3, it never equals 0 modulo 3, hence it cannot be of the form ( 3 times text{integer} ). 8. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the equation ( m^3 = 3n^2 + 3n + 7 ) cannot have any integer solutions ( m ) and ( n ).

It is allowed to pour as much water from any glass into any other as the latter contains. For which n is it possible to eventually collect all the water into a single glass in a finite number of steps?","completion":"1. **Initial Setup**: - Let us consider (n) glasses, each filled with an equal volume of water. - The volume of water in each glass can be denoted as (V). 2. **Operations Allowed**: - We can pour water from any glass (A) into any other glass (B) such that the volume transferred is the same as the current volume in glass (B). For example, if glass (B) has (v_B) volume of water, we can pour (v_B) volume of water from glass (A) to glass (B). 3. **Even Powers of Two**: - If (n) is a power of two, (n = 2^k) for some integer (k), we can use an induction proof to demonstrate that in this case, we can transfer all the water into one glass. 4. **Base Case (Induction)**: - For (k = 1), (n = 2): - Split water as follows: pour water from one glass into the other, doubling the water in the destination glass while emptying the source glass. - Hence, we can merge the water from two glasses into one glass in a single operation. 5. **Inductive Step**: - Assume that for (n = 2^k) glasses (for some (k)), it is possible to merge all water into one glass in finite steps. - We need to prove it for (n = 2^{k+1}) glasses. - Split the (2^{k+1}) glasses into two groups of (2^k). - By the inductive hypothesis, for each group of (2^k) glasses, we can merge the water into one glass within the group. - This results in 2 glasses each holding volumes equal to the sum of (2^k) initial glass volumes. - Finally, merge these two glasses into one using the same method as the base case, treating the two groups as individual glasses. 6. **2. Powers of Two General Proof**: - The inductive process allows us to combine the water from one group into a single glass, and repeat for the other group, finally combining the two resulting glasses. - This process ensures that for (n = 2^k), the algorithm guarantees that all water can be consolidated into a single glass. 7. **Odd or Non-Power of Two**: - Suppose (n) is not a power of two. - Assume that by some steps, we managed to pour all the water into one glass. - Let the initial volume in each glass be 1 unit. Thus, the total volume in one glass is (n) units. - Key observation: After any pour operation, the volume in a given glass is always an integer. - Consider a prime (p) that divides (n) (and is odd since otherwise (n) would already be a power of 2). - Initially, the volume in each glass is divisible by (p). Since pouring does not change the divisibility by (p), the divisibility would hold for all steps. - If finally, the water is in one glass, it should hold volume (V = n) which is divisible by (p), an integer condition contradiction happens if (p) were odd. - This implies that for any non-power of two (n), it is impossible to consolidate the water into one glass under the give rules. # Conclusion: For (n = 2^k), where (k) is an integer, it is possible to pour all the water into a single glass in finite steps.

Each of the cells in the grid is a square. In how many ways can Aston do this? To solve this problem, we need to consider the constraints given: 1. The grid must have rotational symmetry of order two, which means the pattern looks the same when rotated by 180^circ. 2. We need to color exactly three cells. Step 1: Identify the grid and its properties Assume the grid is a 3 x 3 grid (since the problem does not specify otherwise). The central cell of this grid is the center of rotation: [ begin{array}{|c|c|c|} hline 1 & 2 & 3 hline 4 & 5 (center) & 6 hline 7 & 8 & 9 hline end{array} ] Step 2: Central cell must be colored To maintain rotational symmetry of order two, the central cell (cell 5) must be colored because a 3-cell set includes odd number of cells. The central cell maps onto itself when the grid is rotated 180^circ. Step 3: Coloring the remaining cells After coloring the central cell (cell 5), we then need to select two remaining cells to color that will pair with each other under a 180^circ rotation. Step 4: Determine the pairs that respect the symmetry To color cells in a way that respects the 180^circ rotational symmetry, we look for pairs of cells which swap places when the grid is rotated 180^circ.

Now select one additional coin from the remaining coins, and submit the same set of X coins along with this one new coin to the expert. Note the new number beta given by the expert. 4.

First Method 1. **Key Insight**: To ensure that no two knights attack each other, any pair of knights must not occupy positions where they can move into each other's cells in one knight's move. 2. **Cell Coverage with Knights**: At most, each knight can attack only the specific cells at its knight moves (L shapes). 3. **Cell Analysis**: If no two knights attack each other, then each of the 11 knights must cover a distinct set of cells. Hence, for 11 knights, there are 11 sets of cells, each covered by one knight. 4. **Counting Covered Cells**: At minimum, one knight must be able to cover up to 8 unique cells (since each knight has 8 possible moves on an open board). 5. **Cell Requirement**: [ text{Total covered cells} = 11 times 8 = 88 text{ cells} ] However, a chessboard has only 64 cells, so a more refined conclusion can be drawn by considering the actual pawn coverage. At least one more cell remains uncovered by any knight. 6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, there exists at least one cell on the chessboard which is not threatened by any of the 11 knights. We place the 12th knight on this cell. Thus, it is possible to place a 12th knight without being attacked. Second Method 1. **Knights on Different Colored Cells**: Considering the checkered pattern of the chessboard, each knight must be on a different color from adjacent knights to avoid direct conflict since knights move in an L-shape which changes color. 2. **Distribution of Knights**: Out of the 11 knights, it's guaranteed by the pigeonhole principle that at least 6 of them must be on one color. Suppose without loss of generality, that 6 knights are on white squares and 5 on black squares (or vice versa). 3. **Specific Cell Coverage**: If at least 6 knights are placed on white cells, they thereby restrict movement in a maximal number of specific cells on the board just by number. 4. **Counting Threatened Cells**: Even in generality restrictions imply there are still some untouched black cells. 5. **Final Placement**: Thus, it is possible to place one more knight on a remaining black cell that is not threatened by any knights that occupy another color. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{It is possible to place one additional knight on the chessboard without any knights attacking each other.}} ]"},{"prompt":"Given a sequence {a_n} whose sum of the first n terms is S_n, and S_n=2^{n+1}2 (ninmathbb{N}^*).

Solution 1. **Initial Statement and Assumption**: We are asked to prove that [ {x} + {x^2} neq 1 quad text{for any rational number } x. ] 2. **Utilizing the Properties of Floor and Fractional Parts**: Given the equation: [ x^2 + x = left(lfloor x^2 rfloor + lfloor x rfloor right) + left( { x^2 } + { x } right), ] if we assume that [ { x^2 } + { x } = 1, ] this implies that ( left( x^2 + x right) ) must be an integer because the floor and fractional parts of ( x ) and ( x^2 ) respectively split the sum into integer and fractional components. 3. **Solving for ( x ) when ( x^2 + x = k ) (integer)**: Consider [ x^2 + x = k. ] Solving this quadratic equation for ( x ), we get [ x = frac{-1 pm sqrt{1 + 4k}}{2}. ] 4. **Rational Root Consideration**: Since ( x ) is rational, ( sqrt{1 + 4k} ) must also be rational. For the square root of an integer to be rational, the integer must be a perfect square. Thus, [ sqrt{1 + 4k} = m, quad text{where } m text{ is an integer}. ] Therefore, [ 1 + 4k = m^2. ] 5. **Rewriting the Equation**: Rearranging the above equation, [ m^2 - 1 = 4k. ] This implies: [ (m-1)(m+1) = 4k. ] 6. **Parity Analysis**: For ( (m-1)(m+1) ) to be a multiple of 4, ( m ) must be odd (since consecutive even numbers do not produce a multiple of 4). Therefore, [ x = frac{-1 pm m}{2} ] where ( m ) is odd. This means ( x ) is an integer. 7. **Contradiction**: If ( x ) is an integer, then [ {x} = {x^2} = 0, ] which implies [ {x} + {x^2} = 0 neq 1. ] This contradiction invalidates our initial assumption that ( {x^2} + {x} = 1 ). Therefore, we conclude: [ boxed{{x} + {x^2} neq 1 quad text{for any rational number } x.} ] II.

Given that ( p ) and ( q ) are coprime, the only way this can happen is if ( q = pm 1 ), implying that ( x ) must be an integer. 6. **Conclusion**: If ( x ) is an integer, then all fractional parts in the original sum will be zero, preventing the sum from being one. Hence, ( {x^n} + {a_{n-1} x^{n-1}} + ldots + {a_1 x} neq 1 ).

We will provide multiple approaches to prove this statement. I. First Solution Using Trigonometric Identities: 1. **Starting with known trigonometric identities:** Given: [ b = frac{a + c}{sqrt{2}}, quad beta = frac{alpha + gamma}{2} ] 2. **Express the sides in terms of sine functions:** [ frac{a + c}{b} = frac{a}{b} + frac{c}{b} = frac{sin alpha + sin gamma}{sin beta} ] 3. **Using the sum-to-product identities of sine:** [ sin alpha + sin gamma = 2 sin frac{alpha + gamma}{2} cos frac{gamma - alpha}{2} ] Therefore, [ frac{a + c}{b} = frac{2 sin frac{alpha + gamma}{2} cos frac{gamma - alpha}{2}}{sin beta} ] 4. **Substitute (beta = frac{alpha + gamma}{2}):** [ frac{a + c}{b} = frac{2 sin beta cos frac{gamma - alpha}{2}}{sin beta} = 2 cos frac{gamma - alpha}{2} ] 5. **Equating and solving:** Given ( b = frac{a + c}{sqrt{2}} ), we get: [ 2 cos frac{gamma - alpha}{2} = sqrt{2} ] Thus, [ 2 cos frac{gamma - alpha}{2} = 2 sin 45^circ = 2 left( frac{1}{sqrt{2}} right) = sqrt{2} ] 6. **Solve for (gamma - alpha):** [ cos frac{gamma - alpha}{2} = frac{1}{sqrt{2}} implies frac{gamma - alpha}{2} = 45^circ implies gamma - alpha = 90^circ ] 7. **Conclusion:** [ gamma = alpha + 90^circ ] [ boxed{gamma = alpha + 90^circ} ] II. Second Solution by Arithmetic Mean: 1. **Recognize the arithmetic mean relationship:** If ( beta = frac{alpha + gamma}{2} ), it implies that ( alpha, beta, gamma ) are in arithmetic sequence. 2. **Identify the specific angle value:** The middle term of three such angles in arithmetic progression is the average: [ beta = 60^circ ] 3. **Utilize ( c > a ) to deduce the inequality among angles:** Since ( c > a ), we know ( gamma > alpha ). Hence, [ alpha < 60^circ < gamma ] 4. **Rotate ( BC ) to extend line ( AB ) and apply geometric properties:** Let ( BD = a ) (since ( BC ) rotated by ( B )) and hence ( AD = a + c ). Since ( BCD ) is isosceles with an angle bisected by ( 30^circ ): [ text{We seek an isosceles right triangle}, implies text{Angles complement each other to } 45^circ. ] # Conclusion: Both methods effectively demonstrate that the condition ( gamma = alpha + 90^circ ) holds true given the initial assumptions.

Assume gcd(n, 200) = d, then d + 1000 must be a multiple of 200 greater than d. We simplify the values for gcd that fulfill d + 1000 = k cdot 200 where k is an integer. Listing pairs: - For d = 100, we get 1100 = 200 cdot 5.5 (invalid, not an integer) - For d = 50, we get 1050 = 200 cdot 5.25 (invalid, not an integer) - For other values (like 1, 2, 4, 8, ...), 1000+d wouldn't be a multiple of 200 except for d = 200, but 200+1000 = 1200 implies n=600.

Conclusion: From the calculations, there are no values of n that satisfy the given relations under the condition n < 1000.

Therefore, the total sum of internal angles of all ( n ) quadrilaterals is: [ S = 360^circ times n ] 4. **Non-convex angle condition:** Each non-convex quadrilateral has at least one internal angle that is greater than ( 180^circ ). This angle must be inside the polygon ( P ). 5. **Sum of angles around such vertices:** For each non-convex quadrilateral, there is at least one vertex where the sum of angles around that vertex sums to ( 360^circ ).

Therefore, we calculate the number of ways using the permutation formula {P}_{n}^{r} = frac{n!}{(n-r)!}, where n is the total number of steps and r is the number of people. For this case, n=5 and r=4, so we have: {A}_{5}^{4} = frac{5!}{(5-4)!} = frac{5!}{1!} = 5 cdot 4 cdot 3 cdot 2 = 120 2. **Case 2: Only two people are on the same step.** Here, we first choose 2 people out of 4 to stand together on the same step, which can be done in {C}_{4}^{2} ways.

Due to the faulty weight, he actually takes 10% more, which is 1000 grams + 10% of 1000 grams = 1000 + 100 = 1100 grams. Now, when he sells to the customer, he uses a weight such that when 30% is added to it, the claimed weight is obtained. Let's denote the actual weight he gives to the customer as x grams. Therefore, x + 30% of x should equal the weight he claims to sell, which is 1000 grams (the original weight he should have received from the supplier). So, we have: x + 0.30x = 1000 1.30x = 1000 x = 1000 / 1.30 x = 769.23 grams (approximately) So, the trader gives the customer approximately 769.23 grams but charges for 1000 grams. The profit he makes from the customer is the difference between what he claims to sell (1000 grams) and what he actually sells (769.23 grams), which is 1000 - 769.23 = 230.77 grams. To find the profit percentage, we need to calculate the profit relative to the cost price. The cost price for the trader is the actual weight he should have received from the supplier, which is 1000 grams. However, he got 1100 grams due to cheating the supplier.

Let's denote these two half-planes as H_1 and H_2. 3. **Traversing the Polygonal Chain:** As we traverse the polygonal chain starting from an initial vertex and moving along each segment, we must check where the segments cross the straight line. 4. **Crossing Property:** Each time a segment of the polygonal chain intersects the straight line, we transition from one half-plane to the other (from H_1 to H_2 or from H_2 to H_1). 5. **Returning to the Start:** Since the polygonal chain is closed, after traversing all 11 segments, we must end up where we started. This implies that the number of times we cross the line must be even because we start in a half-plane and to return to that same half-plane, the total number of crossings must cancel out (even number of transitions). 6. **Contradiction:** An 11-segment polygonal chain cannot be crossed an even number of times because 11 is an odd number.

When the self-checkout is broken, the number of complaints increases by another 20%, which is ( 0.20 times frac{4}{3}C = frac{4}{3}C times frac{1}{5} = frac{4}{15}C ).

Let's consider the conditions given in the problem for the arithmetic mean. Specifically, each number on the grid is the arithmetic mean of its four neighbors. We need to check if this implies that all numbers on the grid are equal. 2. We'll show that the numbers do not necessarily need to be equal by providing a counterexample. 3.

Next, place \`1\` in the cell to the right and \`-1\` in the cell to the left.

Now, consider the second scenario where each number in the grid is the geometric mean of its four neighbors' numbers. The geometric mean of four numbers (a, b, c, d) is given by: [ text{Geometric Mean} = sqrt[4]{abcd} ] 2. Negative numbers cannot be part of the configuration since the geometric mean involves the fourth root of a product, which must be non-negative if it consists of real numbers. 3. Since we only deal with non-negative integers, there must be at least one number ( n ) which is the smallest among its neighbors. Let's consider this minimum number ( n ) with its neighbors ( a, b, c, d ). 4. According to the condition ( n ), this must be true: [ n = sqrt[4]{abcd} ] Since (a, b, c, d geq n), each neighboring number must be at least ( n ). 5. The only way for this condition ( n = sqrt[4]{abcd} ) to hold true while all the numbers (a, b, c, d) being at least ( n ) is if (a = b = c = d = n). 6. If ( n = 0 ): - All neighbors ( a, b, c, d ) must also be ( 0 ). This value extends to every cell in the grid making all numbers on the grid ( 0 ). 7.

Solving for q: 0.60q = 5.50 implies q = frac{5.50}{0.60} = 9.1667. Since q must be an integer, we take the greatest integer less than or equal to 9.1667, which is 9. Therefore, d geq 3 times 9 = 27.

Define ( s = left[sqrt[3]{n-1}right] ) and ( t = left[sqrt[3]{n}right] ). 5.

However, the direct calculation can be quite complex. A more straightforward approach is to consider the problem as finding the number of derangements for a subset of the balls. First, we choose 3 balls out of the 10, which will not match the numbers of their boxes. There are binom{10}{3} ways to do this. Next, we need to find the number of ways to place these 3 balls into the remaining 7 boxes (excluding the 3 boxes with matching numbers) such that no ball matches its box number. This is a classic problem of derangements, often denoted as !n for n objects. For 3 objects, the number of derangements is !3 = 2. This is because there are only two ways to place 3 distinct objects into 3 distinct places without any of them being in their original place. Therefore, the total number of ways to place the balls such that exactly 3 balls do not match the numbers of their boxes is binom{10}{3} times !3.

Since Jake weighs 8 kg more than Tracy, we can calculate his weight as follows: Jake's weight = Tracy's weight + 8 kg Jake's weight = 52 kg + 8 kg Jake's weight = 60 kg Now, we know the range of their weights is 14 kg. The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values. Since Tracy weighs the least and Jake weighs the most, we can find John's weight by considering the range: Range = Jake's weight - Tracy's weight 14 kg = 60 kg - Tracy's weight Tracy's weight = 60 kg - 14 kg Tracy's weight = 46 kg However, this result contradicts the given information that Tracy weighs 52 kg. Therefore, we must have made a mistake in our assumption. Let's correct this. The range is actually the difference between the heaviest and the lightest person. Since we know Tracy's weight (52 kg) and Jake's weight (60 kg), the range must be between John's weight and either Tracy's or Jake's weight. Since the range is 14 kg and Jake is heavier than Tracy, John must weigh either 14 kg more than Jake or 14 kg less than Tracy. If John weighs 14 kg more than Jake: John's weight = Jake's weight + 14 kg John's weight = 60 kg + 14 kg John's weight = 74 kg If John weighs 14 kg less than Tracy: John's weight = Tracy's weight - 14 kg John's weight = 52 kg - 14 kg John's weight = 38 kg Since John cannot weigh more than the range allows, the correct weight for John must be 38 kg.

The coordinates of the foci are therefore at (sqrt{5}, 0) and (-sqrt{5}, 0) for the given ellipse. Since an ellipse that shares the same foci will have the same value of c, we maintain c=sqrt{5}. The new ellipse also passes through the point (3, -2). If we maintain the same vertical semi-axis b (as we are keeping the same foci along the x-axis and changing a does not affect the foci), we must find an appropriate value of a such that the point (3, -2) is on the ellipse.

The total amount of food eaten by all dogs in a day is the amount one dog eats per meal times the number of meals times the number of dogs, which is 4 pounds/meal * 3 meals/day * 3 dogs = 36 pounds/day.

By applying Bezout's identity to (a y + b) and (c): [ (a y + b) x + c z = 1 ] This shows that we can send ((a, b, c) rightarrow (x y, x, z)), where (x y) and (x) are reduced further, repeating the above steps to achieve the desired vector. 6. **Final Vector Configuration to ((1, 0, 0)):** Finally, once the vector is either ((1, 0, 0)), ((0, 1, 0)), or ((0, 0, 1)), appropriate steps like ((0, 1, 0) rightarrow (1, 1, 0) rightarrow (1, 0, 0)) finish the transformation. 7. **Concatenating Steps for Sequences:** By concatenating the sequences for each transformation step, we ensure that the dot product condition (a_{i-1}a_i + b_{i-1}b_i + c_{i-1}c_i = 1) is satisfied for all (1 leq i leq n).

Consider the line ( ell_1 ) passing through ( O_1 ) and parallel to ( OB ). Similarly, consider the line ( ell_2 ) passing through ( O_2 ) and parallel to ( OA ). 5. By the Thales theorem, if two lines are parallel, the segment joining them at corresponding points (vertical segment in this case) gets divided into equal ratios. Therefore, lines ( ell_1 ) and ( ell_2 ) will intersect at some point ( C ) on the line segment ( AB ). 6.

If triangle ( ABC ) is equilateral, then all its sides are equal, and each angle measures ( 60^circ ). 4. Let's first consider the case when ( k ) makes ( triangle ABC ) equilateral: - Thus ( AC = BC = AB ). - Given ( AC = 12 ), it follows that ( k = 12 ) in this case. 5. Now consider the case when ( triangle ABC ) is a general triangle with ( angle ABC = 60^circ ). - Using the Law of Sines, we know ( frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C} ). - Specifically, for this problem, we use the following version of the Law of Cosines, which is applicable when one angle is ( 60^circ ): [ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - ab ] - Here, ( a = AC = 12 ), ( b = k ), and ( c = AB ). 6. Substitute ( angle C = 60^circ ) and use the given value ( AC = 12 ): [ c^2 = 12^2 + k^2 - 12k cdot cos 60^circ ] Since ( cos 60^circ = frac{1}{2} ), we get: [ c^2 = 144 + k^2 - 6k ] 7.

A line parallel to ( OB ) is drawn through ( A ), intersecting the circle at point ( C ), and the line ( OC ) intersects the circle again at point ( D ). Prove that the line ( AD ) bisects the segment ( OB ).","completion":"**First Solution:** 1. Let the given circle be denoted as k and the line passing through point B perpendicular to OB be denoted as t. 2. The lines OB and AC are symmetric with respect to the axis t since they are perpendicular to it. Therefore, the circle k, which touches OB at B, and the segment AC are also symmetric with respect to t. Hence, triangle ABC is an isosceles triangle, and the angle angle BAC is equal to the angle angle OAB since both angles share the side AB and AC parallel OB. 3. Since the line AB separates points C and O, the orientations of triangles ABC and ABO are opposite. This implies that the rotation taking BA to CA has the same direction as the rotation taking AB to OB. Thus, the rotation angles angle BAC and angle OAB are equal. Similarly, angle CBA and angle BOA are also equal. 4. Rotate the triangle CBO around point B such that C maps onto A and let the new position of O be denoted as E. The rotation angles angle BOA and angle OEB are equal; therefore, OB separates points A and E. Thus, triangles ABO and EOB are symmetric with respect to the midpoint of OB, denoted as F, and consequently AE bisects OB. 5. The rotation around B that maps C to A also maps O to E. The intersection point of line CO and AE therefore lies on the circle k. Since this point coincides with the intersection of k and OC, it must be D. Therefore, AD bisects OB as required. **Second Solution:** 1. Let the intersection of AB and OC be denoted as P. Draw a line through point P parallel to OB. 2. Let this line intersect OA at Q. In triangles ACP and ABQ, we know angle CAP = angle BAQ (from the first solution), and frac{AC}{AB} = frac{AB}{OB} = frac{AP}{AQ}. Hence triangles ACP and ABQ are similar, implying angle ACP = angle ABQ. 3. Let the intersection point of OC and BQ be denoted as R. Then line AR is seen at equal angles from points C and B, and these points lie on the same side of line AR. Thus, ACBR forms a cyclic quadrilateral, meaning R lies on circle k, and thus R and D are identical. 4. The diagonals of trapezoid OBPQ intersect at D, and the intersection of its sides is A. Thus, AD bisects the parallel sides, and hence, bisects OB. **Third Solution:** 1. Let the circle passing through point A and touching line BO at O be denoted as g, and let M be the intersection point of k and g, distinct from A. 2. The rotation about M moving MO to MA takes the tangent at O on circle g to OA. Since OB parallel AC, the same rotation angle moves AC to OA and MC to MA. Therefore, the points O, M, and C are collinear, so M must be D. 3. Let the intersection of AD and OB be denoted as F. For point F, the following relationship holds: ( FM cdot FA = FB^2 ) and ( FM cdot FA = FO^2 ). Hence, point F bisects the segment OB.

Let's consider the two possible scenarios for an isosceles triangle: 1. **When one of the equal sides is 6:** In an isosceles triangle, two sides are of equal length. If one of these sides (not the base) is 6, then the other side is also 6. Let b represent the base of the triangle. The perimeter of the triangle is the sum of its three sides, which gives us the equation: [6 + 6 + b = 16] Solving for b, we get: [12 + b = 16] [b = 16 - 12] [b = 4] In this case, the base of the triangle is 4, and the sides are 6, 6, 4. These lengths satisfy the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side. 2. **When the base is 6:** If the base of the triangle is 6, then the other two sides (the equal sides of the isosceles triangle) must have the same length. Let this common length be x. The perimeter of the triangle is given by: [x + x + 6 = 16] Solving for x, we get: [2x + 6 = 16] [2x = 10] [x = 5] In this scenario, the two equal sides are each 5 units long, and the base is 6 units long. This also satisfies the triangle inequality theorem. Therefore, the length of the base can either be 4 or 6, depending on which sides are considered equal in the isosceles triangle.

Define the set ( S = A - A setminus {0} = {a_i - a_j : i ne j} ). 3. **Introduce the concept of a \\"good\\" number**: A positive integer ( n > 1 ) is called *good* if all its prime factors are greater than ( max(S) ). 4. **Claim**: All good numbers cannot be in ( A + B ). *Proof*: If a good number ( n ) were in ( A + B ), then for a large prime ( p ), many divisors of ( p ) would be in ( A + B ), which contradicts the assumption that any two distinct elements in ( A + B ) are coprime. Therefore, good numbers cannot be in ( A + B ). 5. **Fix a good number ( n )**: Choose a good number ( n ) that is not in ( A + B ). 6. **Key Claim**: Arbitrarily large numbers in the set ( A + B ) are divisible by some element of ( n + S ). *Proof*: Let ( lambda ) be the product of all numbers in the set ( n + S ). Observe that ( gcd(n, lambda) = 1 ). For ( t in mathbb{Z}^+ ) satisfying ( gcd(t, n) = 1 ), take ( m = t lambda ). There exists some ( x in A + B ) such that ( x equiv n pmod{m} ).

This leads to a contradiction because it implies that some two elements of ( A + B ) are not coprime, which contradicts the initial assumption.

The segments from O perpendicular to the tangents where these circles touch will be denoted as follows: - OP, OQ, OR, and OS are perpendicular from O to the common external tangents of the circles. - AA_1, AA_2, BB_1, BB_2, CC_1, CC_2, DD_1, and DD_2 are segments from points A, B, C, and D respectively to their corresponding tangents. 3. **Identify trapezoids:** From the assumed construction, we observe that: - Quadrilaterals AA_1C_1C, AA_2C_2C, BB_1D_1D, and BB_2D_2D are trapezoids, because each has a pair of parallel sides.

Therefore, the four tangents will produce a quadrilateral where a circle can be inscribed within it. This circle will touch all four sides of the quadrilateral, hence proving the quadrilateral is indeed a tangential quadrilateral.

Он является протеолитическим ферментом, который приводит к расщеплению альфа-глобулина плазмы крови ангиотензиногена с образованием ангиотензиногена 1. Под влиянием ангиотензинпревращающего фермента ангиотензиноген 1 превращается в активный ангиотензин 2, Являющийся мощным сосудосуживающим веществом. Соответственно он повышает АД. Кроме того, он стимулирует секрецию альдостерона, который увеличивает реабсорбцию натрия в почечных канальцах, что ведет к задержке воды в организме и повышению АД.  В почках синтезируются вещества, снижающие тонус сосудов и оказывающие депрессорное действие (снижают АД): депрессорный нейтральный липид мозгового вещества, простагландины, кинины.  Почка участвует в поддержании водно-электролитного обмена, объема внутрисосудистой, вне- и внутриклеточной жидкости, что является важным для уровня АД.  Кроме того, почка экскретирует большинство гормонов и других ФАВ, которые являются гуморальными регуляторами АД, поддерживая их необходимый уровень в крови. Поддержание объема циркулирующей жидкости в организме осуществляется почками путем изменения выделения воды и ионов натрия с мочой с помощью главным образом АДГ, альдостерона и натрийуретического гормона. 1)При увеличении объема циркулирующей жидкости в организме и соответственно ОЦК(гиперволемии) возбуждаются волюморецепторы, расположенные в основном в предсердиях, правом желудочке, легочных артериях и венах, в полых вена вблизи сердца. 2) Импульсы идут в ЦНС, угнетая секрецию АДГ в гипоталамусе, что приводит к увеличению диуреза. 3)Растяжение стенок предсердий приводит к стимуляции выработки клетками предсердий атриального пептида натрийуретического гормона, который усиливает выделение ионов натрия и воды почкой. При уменьшении ОЦК возникают противоположные реакции. В регуляции ОЦК принимает участие и ренин-ангиотензин-альдостероновая система. При снижении ОЦК уменьшается АД, что приводит к увеличению секреции ренина. Ренин, вс вою очередь, увеличивает образование в крови ангиотензина 2, который стимулирует секрецию альдостерона. Альдостерон вызывает повышение реабсорбции натрия в канальцах, а за ним и воды (ОЦК возрастает).","completion":"Вот структурированный текст: # Роль почек в регуляции системного артериального давления (АД) и объема циркулирующей крови Механизмы регуляции - **Синтез Ренина** - Ренин, протеолитический фермент, приводит к образованию ангиотензиногена 1 из альфа-глобулина плазмы крови. - Ангиотензиноген 1 превращается под действием ангиотензинпревращающего фермента в активный ангиотензин 2, мощный сосудосуживающий агент, что повышает АД. - Ангиотензин 2 стимулирует секрецию альдостерона, увеличивающего реабсорбцию натрия и задержку воды, что ведет к повышению АД. - **Синтез веществ, снижающих АД** - Почки синтезируют вещества, оказывающие депрессорное действие на тонус сосудов и снижающие АД, такие как депрессорный нейтральный липид мозгового вещества, простагландины, кинины. - **Поддержание водно-электролитного обмена** - Регуляция объема внутрисосудистой, вне- и внутриклеточной жидкости, важная для уровня АД. - **Экскреция гормонов и гуморальных регуляторов АД** - Почка экскретирует большинство гормонов и других физиологически активных веществ (ФАВ), поддерживая их уровень в крови.

Differential signaling (farklı sinyal iletimi) teknolojisini kullanarak, veri iletiminde yüksek güvenilirlik ve uzun mesafelerde stabil bir performans sunar. Bu standard, aslen 1978 yılında Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA) tarafından belirlenmiştir. RS-422, RS-232 standardının birçok sınırlılığını aşmak için tasarlanmıştır, özellikle de iletim mesafesi ve hızı konularında önemli iyileştirmeler sunar. RS-422, dengeli iletimi kullanır; yani her veri sinyali, iki iletken üzerinden gönderilir: biri pozitif (+) ve diğeri negatif (-) sinyal olarak. Bu yöntem, elektriksel gürültüye karşı yüksek direnç sağlar çünkü alıcı tarafındaki fark alıcısı (differential receiver), iki iletken arasındaki voltaj farkını algılar. Herhangi bir gürültü her iki iletkeni de benzer şekilde etkilediği için, farklı olarak alınan sinyaldeki gürültü büyük ölçüde iptal edilir. Bu, RS-422'nin 1200 metreye kadar olan mesafelerde ve 10 Mbps'ye kadar hızlarda veri iletimine olanak tanır. Bununla birlikte, hız ile mesafe arasında ters orantılı bir ilişki vardır; yani iletim hızı arttıkça maksimum mesafe azalır. RS-422 arabirimi, tipik olarak 4 iletkenli (iki çift) bir kablo kullanır. Bu, tek bir çiftin veri iletimi için, diğer çiftin ise isteğe bağlı kontrol sinyalleri veya ters yönde veri iletimi için kullanılmasını sağlar. Her bir çift, dengeli iletim avantajından yararlanır. RS-422, aynı anda birden çok verici (driver) ve alıcı (receiver) desteği sunar - genellikle bir verici ve 10'a kadar alıcıya kadar destek verebilir. Bu, RS-422'yi çok noktaya yayın yapabilen uygulamalar için ideal kılar. Günümüzde RS-422, endüstriyel kontrol sistemleri, telekomünikasyon ağlarında, bilgisayar ağ yapısında ve diğer birçok uygulamada veri iletimi için popüler bir seçenek olarak kullanılmaktadır. Farklı sinyal iletimi ve dengeli iletim özellikleri, elektriksel parazitlerin ve sinyal kaybının minimalize edilmesini sağlayarak, zorlu çevresel koşullarda bile güvenilir veri iletimi sunar."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Quadratic probing uses a hash function of the form: [ h(k, i) = (h'(k) + c_1 i + c_2 i^2) mod m ] where ( k ) is the key being inserted or searched, ( i ) is the attempt number (starting from 0 for the first attempt), ( h'(k) ) is the primary hash function, and ( c_1 ) and ( c_2 ) are constants. For simplicity and without loss of generality, let's consider ( c_1 = 0, c_2 = 1 ) for our proof, simplifying our hash function to: [ h(k, i) = (h'(k) + i^2) mod m ] We need to show that for this hash function, if ( m ) is prime and the table is at least half empty, each probe sequence ( h(k,i) ) for ( i = 0, 1, ldots, m-1 ) will hit a free slot, ensuring that the element can be inserted. **Proof:** For quadratic probing to guarantee finding a free slot under the conditions stated, it must produce a probe sequence that is a permutation of ( 0, 1, ldots, m-1 ) or at least cover more than half of the table slots when the table is at least half empty, ensuring that it will encounter a free slot. Given ( m ) is a prime number, the series produced by ( i^2 mod m ) for ( i = 0, 1, ldots, frac{m-1}{2} ) are all distinct. This is because if there were ( i, j ) such that ( i^2 equiv j^2 (mod m) ), ( i neq j ), and ( 0 ≤ i, j ≤ frac{m-1}{2} ), then ( m ) would divide ( (i+j)(i-j) ). Since ( m ) is prime, it would have to divide one of the factors ( (i+j) ) or ( (i-j) ). However, because both ( i ) and ( j ) are within ( 0 ) to ( frac{m-1}{2} ), their sum is less than ( m ), and their difference cannot be ( m ) (as neither ( i ) nor ( j ) can be negative or equal to ( m )). This implies no two squares are congruent modulo ( m ) within the first half of the sequence, proving the elements ( i^2 mod m ) are unique in this range. To extend the above argument, for ( i ) from ( 0 ) to ( m-1 ), the quadratic probing function generates a sequence of up to ( m ) unique hashes before repeating. Because we're given the table is at least half empty, and our sequence covers more than half of the table uniquely (due to its properties of generating unique values for at least half of its length), it guarantees hitting an empty slot without wrapping around and repeating values. Thus, with a prime number ( m ) and at least half of the slots empty, quadratic probing will encounter a free slot within the first ( m ) probes, ensuring that an insertion is always possible. This property hinges crucially on ( m ) being prime. In the case where ( m ) is not a prime number, the uniqueness and coverage properties of the quadratic probe sequence can be significantly weaker, potentially failing to ensure a free slot is found for insertion when the table is half empty."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It appears your message was cut off before you could finish. Could you please provide more details or let me know how I can assist you further?"},{"prompt":"List the books that were not included in this list of your and why","completion":"Given the comprehensive nature of the reading pathway provided earlier, I aimed to cover a broad spectrum of topics related to self-learning, productivity, focus, decision-making, and self-improvement. To address the request regarding books that were not included in the list and their reasons, I would need to cross-reference against the original list provided. Since I cannot access external databases or lists beyond our current interactions, I'll offer a general approach on how to determine which books might not have been included and why they may have been omitted: # Possible Reasons for Omission: 1. **Overlap in Content:** Books with very similar content, offering redundant information may have been excluded to keep the list concise and varied. 2. **Niche or Specialized Topics:** Books that focus on very niche or highly specialized subjects may have been left out if they did not contribute to the broader foundational knowledge and skill sets the pathway aimed to establish. 3. **Accessibility and Relevance:** Books that are not widely accessible or currently out of print may have been excluded. Similarly, books that contain outdated information or lack relevance to modern learning, productivity techniques, and self-improvement may have been omitted. 4. **Scope of the List:** The focus was on creating a pathway that gradually builds up from foundational skills to more advanced techniques and knowledge. Books that did not fit into this developmental narrative, or that might require prerequisite knowledge beyond what was established in the early stages of the pathway, might not have been included. 5. **Subjective Selection:** The selection of books inherently involves a degree of subjectivity, based on the perceived value they bring to the overarching goal of building comprehensive understanding and skills in self-learning, critical thinking, and self-improvement. Without knowing which specific books you're referring to that were not included, it's challenging to specify why certain titles were omitted. If you have particular books in mind that you believe should be part of such a learning pathway, I'd encourage sharing them, as this can provide valuable insight into different perspectives on the subjects of self-improvement and lifelong learning. Each reader's journey is unique, and additional recommendations can further enrich the learning experience."},{"prompt":"Давай дадим тебе роль.

Keys are converted to indexes (via a hash function) where values are stored. - **Quadratic Probing**: A collision resolution method in open addressing hash tables where, upon a collision, the algorithm probes the table at quadratic intervals (i.e., 1, 4, 9, 16, ...) from the original hash index to find an empty slot. - **Prime Number Table Size**: The size of the hash table is a prime number. # Quadratic Probing Formula: The formula for quadratic probing is given by: [ new_index = (hash + c_1 cdot i^2 + c_2 cdot i) mod table_size ] where (i) is the ith attempt at resolving a collision, and (c_1) and (c_2) are constants. For simplicity, assume (c_2 = 0) and (c_1 = 1), reducing the formula to: [ new_index = (hash + i^2) mod table_size ] # Proof Idea: The key idea behind the proof is to show that when the table size is a prime number and at least half empty, each probe sequence can hit each slot at most once before finding an open slot, thus ensuring that an insertion is always possible. **Step 1**: Assume the hash table's size is a prime number (p), and it’s at least half empty. **Step 2**: Quadratic probing generates a sequence of the form (hash, hash + 1^2, hash + 2^2, hash + 3^2, ldots, hash + i^2), modulo (p). **Step 3**: For an insertion to always be possible when the table is at least half empty, we must show that the probe sequence can reach an open slot without repeating any slot until it has probed at least half of the table size. **Step 4**: We need to prove that for any two different integers (i) and (j) where (0 leq i, j < p), the quadratic probes (hash + i^2) and (hash + j^2) are congruent modulo (p) only if (i = j). This is basically showing the probe sequence’s uniqueness. [ (hash + i^2) mod p = (hash + j^2) mod p ] [ Rightarrow i^2 mod p = j^2 mod p ] [ Rightarrow (i - j)(i + j) mod p = 0 ] Since (p) is prime, (p) can only divide this product if it divides one of the factors. But since (i) and (j) are distinct and less than (p) (a prime number), neither (i-j) nor (i+j) is divisible by (p) (except in the trivial case where (i) and (j) are directly related to (p) in a way that defies the inequality, which is impossible under our constraints). **Step 5**: This directly implies that each probe in the sequence will access a distinct slot until at least half of the table has been probed, which ensures the possibility of insertion due to the table being at least half empty. # Conclusion: By ensuring the table size is a prime number and assuming the table is at least half-empty, quadratic probing will encounter an empty slot without repeating positions in the probe sequence. Thus, it's proven that one can always insert an element under these conditions."},{"prompt":"Write a news article saying S4C isn't like Channel 4 anymore, and say who it's mainly with now","completion":"# Welsh Broadcaster S4C Breaks Traditional Ties with Channel 4, Aligns More Closely with BBC In a significant shake-up of the British broadcasting landscape, S4C, the Welsh language television channel, has announced a pivot away from its long-standing association with Channel 4. This strategic realignment sees S4C fostering closer operational and strategic ties with the BBC, setting a new course for the future of Welsh language broadcasting. Since its inception in 1982, S4C has been at the forefront of promoting Welsh language and culture, offering a wide range of programming that includes news, sports, drama, and music, all in the Welsh language. Traditionally, S4C had received programming and support from Channel 4, but in recent years, the broadcaster has been increasingly collaborating with the BBC. This latest announcement formalizes the relationship, marking a departure from Channel 4 and signifying a new era for S4C. Owen Evans, S4C's Chief Executive, heralded the move as a \\"significant milestone\\" in the channel's evolution. \\"Our collaboration with the BBC will allow us to increase our range of high-quality Welsh language content and reach more viewers across Wales and beyond,\\" Evans stated. \\"While we cherish the history and past collaborations with Channel 4, this strategic shift aligns more closely with our vision for the future of S4C as a dynamic and vibrant part of the Welsh media landscape.\\" The shift in alliance comes at a time of changing viewer habits and increased competition from digital platforms. S4C's decision to integrate more closely with the BBC involves not only programming but also leveraging distribution channels to ensure Welsh language content is more accessible. This includes expanded access through the BBC iPlayer, which has become a vital platform for S4C, ensuring its content reaches a broader audience. The move has been well-received in many quarters, including the Welsh Government, which sees the strengthened partnership between S4C and the BBC as a positive development for the promotion of the Welsh language and culture. Minister for Welsh Language and Communications, Delyth Jewell, remarked, \\"This new direction for S4C is a testament to our commitment to the Welsh language. Working more closely with the BBC, S4C can continue to be a pioneering force in broadcasting, offering a unique and vital service to Welsh speakers and learners alike.\\" While some may view the departure from Channel 4 as the end of an era, others see it as an opportunity for S4C to reinvent itself in an ever-evolving media landscape. By aligning more closely with the BBC, S4C is positioning itself to leverage the strengths of both broadcasters, promising a bright future for Welsh language content. As S4C embarks on this new chapter, the focus remains firmly on serving its audience with high-quality Welsh language programming. This strategic realignment reaffirms S4C's commitment to innovation, accessibility, and the promotion of Welsh culture, ensuring its place as a beloved fixture in Welsh homes for years to come."},{"prompt":"Could you come up with names for geometry dash levels?
