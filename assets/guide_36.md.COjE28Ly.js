Just keep pushing, and we’ll welcome Sakura into this world together.” (Moments later, the ambulance team arrives and takes charge of the situation.) Paramedic: “Alright, everyone, we’re here now. Let us take over and get Natsuki to the hospital. You all did a great job in supporting her.” MC: “But her labor is progressing much faster than normal.

Education and awareness: Providing education and raising awareness about the consequences of cyberbullying among parents, teachers, and students is crucial. It is important to teach digital literacy and responsible online behavior to help prevent cyberbullying incidents. 2. Strict policies and laws: Implementing strict policies and laws that explicitly define cyberbullying as a punishable offense can act as a deterrent. This would ensure that offenders face appropriate consequences for their actions. 3. Collaboration between schools, parents, and online platforms: Schools should actively collaborate with parents to address cyberbullying incidents and enforce appropriate disciplinary actions. Online platforms should also enforce and strengthen their policies against bullying, making it easier for individuals to report and block abusive users. 4. Anonymous reporting systems: Establishing anonymous reporting systems can encourage bystanders to report incidents of cyberbullying without fear of retaliation. This would help victims receive timely support and intervention. 5. Building resilience in children: Promoting resilience and emotional well-being in children can help them cope with the effects of cyberbullying. Teaching strategies such as empathy, kindness, and positive conflict resolution can empower children to stand up against bullying and support their peers. 6. Mental health support: Providing mental health support services within schools and communities is essential. Victims of cyberbullying often require professional help to deal with the emotional and psychological impact, and having access to such resources can make a significant difference. 7. Continued research and innovation: Constantly researching and innovating new technologies and methods to prevent and tackle cyberbullying is crucial. This may include developing AI algorithms that can detect and flag harmful content, or creating better reporting mechanisms to swiftly address cyberbullying incidents.

Don’t worry, everything will be okay.” MC: “Let's go, everyone. We’ve got a friend to support and a new life to welcome into the world.” (As they leave the clubroom, the atmosphere is filled with a mix of anxiety, excitement, and hope. Together, they make their way to the hospital, ready to stand by Natsuki’s side during this life-changing moment.)"},{"prompt":"(In the clubroom…) Monika: “MC, I had the weirdest dream last night…” MC: “Oh really?

We’ll make sure you and the baby are safe. Just hold on.” MC: (on the phone) “They’re on their way. Hang in there, Natsuki.” Natsuki: (breathing heavily) “O-Okay…” Yuri: “We should clear some space in the clubroom and make it as comfortable as possible for Natsuki. She needs our support.” Monika: “You’re right, Yuri. Let’s move some chairs and get some blankets.” Sayori: (pacing back and forth) “I can’t believe this is happening.

Solange winces as Dr. Bends examines her legs, his fingers probing the sensitive skin around the amputation sites. SOLANGE: (gritting her teeth) So, Doctor, tell me something. Why did you amputate my right leg? It didn't seem nearly as bad as my left one. DR. BENDS: (looking up from his work) Ah, yes. The eternal question. Why indeed? He leans against the bed, a thoughtful expression on his face. DR. BENDS: (nonchalantly) To be honest, Miss Ancel, I'm not entirely sure it needed to be amputated. Your left leg, well, that was a lost cause. But the right one...it could have gone either way. SOLANGE: (surprised) What? Then why did you do it? DR. BENDS: (shrugging) Utilitarianism, my dear. Simple as that. Better safe than sorry. And let's be real, you're young, you'll adapt. Besides...(he pauses, eyeing Solange's body) you're quite the looker. I figured you'd manage just fine without legs. Solange's eyes narrow, her face twisting into a mixture of anger and disgust. SOLANGE: (bitterly) That's your reasoning? You took away my legs because you think I'm pretty? Because you think I'll 'manage just fine' without them? Are you kidding me? DR. BENDS: (unfazed) No, no, no. Don't misunderstand me. It's nothing personal. I simply believe that, all things considered, you'll make do. Life isn't always fair, Miss Ancel. Sometimes tough decisions need to be made. SOLANGE: (outraged) Tough decisions? You call cutting off someone's limbs without their consent a 'tough decision'? You're sick, Doctor. Sick and twisted. Dr. Bends chuckles, unperturbed by Solange's accusations. DR. BENDS: (leaning closer) Oh, come now. Don't be so dramatic. You're alive, aren't you? That's what matters. The rest is just details. Dr. Bends straightens up, his expression stern. DR. BENDS: (authoritatively) Enough. I've heard enough. You're lucky to be alive, Miss Ancel. Remember that. And don't bother trying to sue me; you won't find a lawyer crazy enough to take your case. With that parting shot, Dr. Bends exits the room, leaving Solange seething in frustration and indignation.\\" Write long and detailed narrative analysis of it.","completion":"The film scene is set in a hospital room during the day, where Solange lies in her bed after having amputations. She appears confident and elegant but pale, and she engages in a conversation with herself as she contemplates her future with a touch of somber humor. Solange talks about becoming a motivational speaker and inspiring others with her story to show that life goes on despite losing her legs. Dr. Bends enters the room, and his imposing figure looms over Solange's bedside. He checks her chart and acknowledges her before turning his attention to her. Solange responds to his presence with a smirk, expressing that she is feeling fine. Dr. Bends smiles wryly in response to her statement, indicating he appreciates her resilient spirit. The scene then shifts to Dr. Bends examining Solange's amputation sites, which causes her discomfort. She seizes the opportunity to question his decision to amputate her right leg, arguing that it seemed less severe than her left one. Dr. Bends admits that he was uncertain about the need for the amputation and considers it an eternal question. He leans against the bed, contemplating his own decision-making process. Dr. Bends nonchalantly explains that he erred on the side of caution and adhered to utilitarianism when making the decision. He justifies his choice by stating that Solange is young and will adapt to life without legs. He then casually comments on her appearance, suggesting that she will manage just fine without her legs due to her attractive appearance. Solange's initial surprise turns into anger and disgust, as she realizes that Dr. Bends made the decision based on superficial reasons. Solange confronts Dr. Bends, bitterly questioning his reasoning and expressing her outrage at having her limbs taken away without her consent. She accuses him of being sick and twisted. Dr. Bends responds with a dismissive chuckle, seemingly unaffected by Solange's accusations. He attributes his decision to the necessity of making tough choices in life, emphasizing that life is not always fair. Solange continues to express her anger and frustration, labeling Dr. Bends' actions as unethical and unacceptable. However, Dr. Bends remains unperturbed by her emotions, believing that being alive is the most important aspect. He brushes off Solange's concerns, commenting that the details are inconsequential. Dr. Bends concludes the encounter by asserting his authority and reminding Solange of her luck to be alive. He insinuates that she has no legal recourse against him, as no lawyer would take her case. With that final statement, Dr. Bends exits the room, leaving Solange seething in frustration and indignation. The film scene explores the complex dynamic between Solange, a patient who has just undergone amputations, and Dr. Bends, a seemingly indifferent and utilitarian doctor. Solange's inner strength and resilience are evident in her conversation with herself, as she contemplates her future with a touch of somber humor. Meanwhile, Dr. Bends represents a callous and ethically questionable medical professional, justifying his decision to amputate based on superficial reasoning and a belief in tough decision-making. The scene highlights the power dynamics within the healthcare system, where doctors often have the final say in life-altering decisions. It raises questions about consent, autonomy, and the ethical responsibilities of medical professionals. Solange's fierce reaction to Dr. Bends' decision reflects the violation she feels, as her own bodily autonomy was disregarded. Furthermore, the dialogue and actions in the scene expose themes of superficiality, discrimination, and the dehumanization of patients by medical practitioners. Dr. Bends' comments about Solange's looks and his nonchalant attitude towards her anger further underline these themes. The film scene successfully captures the emotional intensity and moral conflict within the healthcare setting. It provokes thought, generating discussion on issues such as patient autonomy, the importance of informed consent, and the responsibility of medical professionals to prioritize patient well-being over utilitarian considerations."},{"prompt":"Make the site for I4K Legacy 2, based on I8K Returns.

It was so bizarre!” MC: “Wow, that does sound strange. What were they reciting?” Monika: “I couldn’t really understand all of it, but it seemed like they were reciting love poems. It was quite delightful in a peculiar way. I wish I could remember the verses, they were enchanting.” Sayori: (bursts into the clubroom) “Monika, are you talking about talking cats?! I had the same dream too!” Monika: “No way! You dreamt about talking cats reciting poetry as well?” Sayori: “Yes, it was like a feline poetry slam right here in the clubroom, but the cats were all wearing tiny top hats.” MC: “This is getting weirder by the second. Are you sure we didn’t accidentally go to some magical cat world in our dreams?” Natsuki: (enters the clubroom) “What’s all this commotion about talking cats? You guys are being weird.” Monika: “Natsuki, did you have any weird dreams lately?” Natsuki: “Dreams? Ugh, I don’t remember my dreams. They’re not even worth talking about.” Yuri: (quietly enters the clubroom) “Actually, I had a similar dream as well. The cats were reciting dark and mysterious poems. It was an eerie atmosphere but strangely captivating.” MC: “So it seems like we all had similar dreams with these poetic cats. Is there some kind of hidden meaning behind it?” Monika: “Who knows? Dreams can be unpredictable, but it’s fascinating how all of us experienced the same thing, even if it was bizarre.” Sayori: “I think it would be fun to write our own cat-themed poems based on our dreams. We can have a special cat poetry event!” Natsuki: “Are you serious? Cat-themed poems? Ugh, that sounds silly-” (feels a strong pain, but not from her unborn baby girl - Sakura) “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!

We need an ambulance right away!” Yuri: “Natsuki, try to stay calm. We’ll take care of you.” Natsuki: (gritting her teeth) “I-I’ll try…” Monika: “Don’t worry, Natsuki. We’ll make sure you and the baby are safe. Just hold on.” MC: (on the phone) “They’re on their way. Hang in there, Natsuki.” Natsuki: (breathing heavily) “O-Okay…” Yuri: “We should clear some space in the clubroom and make it as comfortable as possible for Natsuki. She needs our support.” Monika: “You’re right, Yuri. Let’s move some chairs and get some blankets.” Sayori: (pacing back and forth) “I can’t believe this is happening. I hope Natsuki and the baby will be alright…” Yuri: “We need to stay calm and focused. Natsuki needs our positive energy right now.” Natsuki: “Uh…guys?” MC: “Yes, Natsuki? What is it?” Natsuki: “I-I think my water just broke…I’m in active labor…” Monika: “Oh my goodness, this is happening faster than we anticipated! We have to act quickly.

Natsuki’s water broke, and she’s in active labor. Please hurry!” Natsuki: “O-Okay, I’ll try to stay calm…AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!” (As Natsuki lets out an agonizing scream, it eventually becomes clear that she’s just started to push - and they needed to set up a makeshift delivery room.) Monika: “Quick, we need to help Natsuki get into a comfortable position. Yuri, do you have any blankets or towels we can use?” Yuri: “Yes, I have some here. Let me spread them out on the floor for Natsuki.” Sayori: “I’ll grab some water and a clean cloth for Natsuki to cool her forehead with.” MC: “And I’ll double-check the directions to the nearest hospital in case the ambulance doesn’t arrive on time.” (They all work together to support Natsuki during her intense labor, providing emotional and physical comfort. As Natsuki continues to push, the room is filled with a mixture of tension, anticipation, and concern.) Monika: “You’re doing amazing, Natsuki! Just a little more, and you’ll meet your baby!” Natsuki: (straining) “I-I can do this…I can do this…” Yuri: “Remember to breathe, Natsuki, and focus on the end result. Your baby will be here soon.” Sayori: “We’re all here for you, Natsuki. You’re incredibly strong.” (Just as it begins to feel like time has stopped, the sound of sirens is heard outside. The ambulance has arrived.) Paramedic: “We’re here for Natsuki. What’s the situation?” MC: “She’s in active labor, and her water broke. She’s been pushing for a while now.” Natsuki: “Please…just get Sakura out of me…AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!” (The paramedics quickly assess the situation, preparing to transport Natsuki to the ambulance.) Paramedic: “Alright, we’ll take it from here. Let’s get you to the hospital where you can safely deliver your baby.” Natsuki: (weakly) “Please, hurry…AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!! OH GOD, HER HEAD’S CROWNING!!!” (The paramedics act swiftly, carefully assisting Natsuki onto a stretcher and making their way towards the ambulance. The club members stay close, offering words of encouragement.) Monika: (holding Natsuki’s hand) “Stay strong, Natsuki. You’re going to be a wonderful mother.” Sayori: “We’ll be right there with you every step of the way, Natsuki. You’re not alone.” Yuri: “You’re doing amazing, Natsuki. Just remember to keep breathing and focus on bringing your beautiful baby into the world.” MC: (walking alongside the stretcher) “You’re almost there, Natsuki. Just a little while longer.” (Natsuki’s painful cries continue to echo through the clubroom as she is swiftly loaded into the ambulance. But after being loaded into the ambulance, the final stages of her labor begin.) Natsuki: “","completion":"I-I can't hold on much longer... Please...\\" Paramedic: \\"Hang in there, Natsuki.

It was quite delightful in a peculiar way. I wish I could remember the verses, they were enchanting.” Sayori: (bursts into the clubroom) “Monika, are you talking about talking cats?!

The owl, known for its bad luck, often found itself in the most peculiar and unfortunate circumstances. It seemed like trouble always sought him out, even when he was simply trying to enjoy a peaceful moment on his favorite branch. One sunny morning, the little owl decided to venture out from his cozy nest and stretch his wings. He soared through the forest, enjoying the fresh air and the soft caress of the wind against his feathers. As he flew, he couldn't help but notice the cheeky woodpeckers pecking away at tree trunks, the show-off frogs displaying their vibrant colors, and the mischievous fireflies flickering around. Curiosity peaked within the little owl, and he decided to investigate the lively antics of the forest creatures. With each step, he unintentionally stumbled into one mishap after another. The laws of physics seemed to conspire against him. Roots sneaked up to trip him, branches swung down to bonk his head, and stones rolled under his feet, causing him to tumble and fall. As his misfortunes continued, the owl tried desperately to escape the chaos. With outstretched wings, he quickly flew away from the trouble, only to find himself back on his branch before he could catch his breath. It seemed as though the forest had a mind of its own, playfully toying with the poor little owl. Frustrated yet determined, the owl devised a plan to outsmart the forest's tricks. He carefully observed his surroundings, anticipating each trouble that awaited him. But no matter how cautious he became, the forest always found a way to thwart his efforts. The more he tried to avoid trouble, the closer it seemed to follow him. With a heavy heart, the little owl realized that there was no escaping the forest's whimsical pranks. His futile attempts at avoidance had only led to further entanglement in its web of irony. Instead of growing disheartened, the owl decided to embrace his role as the forest's eternal protagonist. He understood that his misadventures were meant to bring joy and laughter to those who witnessed them. And so, with a newfound sense of acceptance, the little pink owl continued to navigate the forest's trails, embracing the absurdity and unpredictability of his life. Each day, he faced the cheeky woodpeckers, the show-off frogs, and the sadistic fireflies with a smile on his face. For even though his misfortunes seemed endless, the little owl knew deep down that his presence brought a touch of magic and laughter to the forest, making it a brighter place for all."},{"prompt":"You are a nutritionist AI and are to only provide carbs, fats, protein in a JSON response for any provided recipe","completion":"Sure!

What was it about?” Monika: “Well, I dreamt that the clubroom was filled with talking cats. They were all wearing bowties and giving poetry recitals. It was so bizarre!” MC: “Wow, that does sound strange. What were they reciting?” Monika: “I couldn’t really understand all of it, but it seemed like they were reciting love poems. It was quite delightful in a peculiar way. I wish I could remember the verses, they were enchanting.” Sayori: (bursts into the clubroom) “Monika, are you talking about talking cats?! I had the same dream too!” Monika: “No way! You dreamt about talking cats reciting poetry as well?” Sayori: “Yes, it was like a feline poetry slam right here in the clubroom, but the cats were all wearing tiny top hats.” MC: “This is getting weirder by the second. Are you sure we didn’t accidentally go to some magical cat world in our dreams?” Natsuki: (enters the clubroom) “What’s all this commotion about talking cats? You guys are being weird.” Monika: “Natsuki, did you have any weird dreams lately?” Natsuki: “Dreams? Ugh, I don’t remember my dreams. They’re not even worth talking about.” Yuri: (quietly enters the clubroom) “Actually, I had a similar dream as well. The cats were reciting dark and mysterious poems. It was an eerie atmosphere but strangely captivating.” MC: “So it seems like we all had similar dreams with these poetic cats. Is there some kind of hidden meaning behind it?” Monika: “Who knows? Dreams can be unpredictable, but it’s fascinating how all of us experienced the same thing, even if it was bizarre.” Sayori: “I think it would be fun to write our own cat-themed poems based on our dreams. We can have a special cat poetry event!” Natsuki: “Are you serious? Cat-themed poems? Ugh, that sounds silly-” (feels a strong pain, but not from her unborn baby girl - Sakura) “AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!! OH GOSH, THIS SHOULDN’T BE HAPPENING NOW!!!” MC: “Natsuki, what’s wrong? Are you okay?” Natsuki: “I’m having contractions!” Monika: “Contractions? Natsuki, are you going into labor? We need to get you to a hospital!” Sayori: “Oh no, this is unexpected! MC, call an ambulance!” MC: (frantically calling) “Yes, hello? We have a member of our club who is going into labor. We need an ambulance right away!” Yuri: “Natsuki, try to stay calm. We’ll take care of you.” Natsuki: (gritting her teeth) “I-I’ll try…” Monika: “Don’t worry, Natsuki. We’ll make sure you and the baby are safe. Just hold on.” MC: (on the phone) “They’re on their way. Hang in there, Natsuki.” Natsuki: (breathing heavily) “O-Okay…” Yuri: “We should clear some space in the clubroom and make it as comfortable as possible for Natsuki. She needs our support.” Monika: “You’re right, Yuri. Let’s move some chairs and get some blankets.” Sayori: (pacing back and forth) “I can’t believe this is happening. I hope Natsuki and the baby will be alright…” Yuri: “We need to stay calm and focused. Natsuki needs our positive energy right now.” Natsuki: “Uh…guys?” MC: “Yes, Natsuki? What is it?” Natsuki: “I-I think my water just broke…I’m in active labor…” Monika: “Oh my goodness, this is happening faster than we anticipated! We have to act quickly.

Just a little longer and everything will be okay.” Monika: “We’re all here for you, Natsuki. You’re not alone.” MC: (on the phone) “Hello? It’s me again. Natsuki’s water broke, and she’s in active labor. Please hurry!” Natsuki: “O-Okay, I’ll try to stay calm…AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH!!!” (As Natsuki lets out an agonizing scream, it eventually becomes clear that she’s just started to push - and they needed to set up a makeshift delivery room.) Monika: “Quick, we need to help Natsuki get into a comfortable position. Yuri, do you have any blankets or towels we can use?” Yuri: “Yes, I have some here. Let me spread them out on the floor for Natsuki.” Sayori: “I’ll grab some water and a clean cloth for Natsuki to cool her forehead with.” MC: “And I’ll double-check the directions to the nearest hospital in case the ambulance doesn’t arrive on time.” (They all work together to support Natsuki during her intense labor, providing emotional and physical comfort. As Natsuki continues to push, the room is filled with a mixture of tension, anticipation, and concern.) Monika: “You’re doing amazing, Natsuki! Just a little more, and you’ll meet your baby!” Natsuki: (straining) “I-I can do this…I can do this…” Yuri: “Remember to breathe, Natsuki, and focus on the end result. Your baby will be here soon.” Sayori: “We’re all here for you, Natsuki. You’re incredibly strong.” (Just as it begins to feel like time has stopped, the sound of sirens is heard outside.

Paramedic: “Alright, we’ll take it from here. Let’s get you to the hospital where you can safely deliver your baby.” Natsuki: (weakly) “Please, hurry…AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!! OH GOD, HER HEAD’S CROWNING!!!” (The paramedics act swiftly, carefully assisting Natsuki onto a stretcher and making their way towards the ambulance. The club members stay close, offering words of encouragement.) Monika: (holding Natsuki’s hand) “Stay strong, Natsuki. You’re going to be a wonderful mother.” Sayori: “We’ll be right there with you every step of the way, Natsuki. You’re not alone.” Yuri: “You’re doing amazing, Natsuki. Just remember to keep breathing and focus on bringing your beautiful baby into the world.” MC: (walking alongside the stretcher) “You’re almost there, Natsuki. Just a little while longer.” (Natsuki’s painful cries continue to echo through the clubroom as she is swiftly loaded into the ambulance. But after being loaded into the ambulance, the final stages of her labor begin.) Natsuki: “I can’t do it…I’m too scared…” Paramedic: “Natsuki, you’re doing great! Just a few more pushes, and you’ll meet your baby!” Natsuki: (sobbing) “I…I don’t know if I can…” Monika: “Natsuki, we believe in you. You’re stronger than you think. We’re right here by your side.” Sayori: “You’ve come this far, Natsuki. You can do it. Just one more push.” Yuri: “Remember why you’re doing this, Natsuki. Your baby is waiting to meet you. You can overcome this fear.” Natsuki: (gathering her strength) “Alright…alright, I’ll try…” (Supportive cheers and words of encouragement fill the air as Natsuki summons every ounce of determination she has left. With one final push, the sound of a baby’s cry fills the ambulance.) Paramedic: “Congratulations, Natsuki! You did it! It’s a healthy baby girl!” Natsuki: (weeping tears of joy) “Oh…oh my gosh…I did it…I have a daughter…” (cradling her newly-born daughter) “Hey there, Sakura. It’s me - your mommy.

palackban","completion":"Ha a must hosszabb ideig erjed a palackban, többféle hatás érvényesülhet: 1. Alkoholtartalom növekedése: A mustban található cukrok az erjesztés során alkohollá alakulnak át, így minél tovább erjed, annál magasabb lesz az alkoholtartalma. Ha a must túl hosszú ideig erjed, azzal növekedhet az alkohol koncentrációja, ami megváltoztathatja az ital ízét és hatását. 2. Cukortartalom csökkenése: Az erjedés során a cukrok elfogyasztásra kerülnek, így a mustban lévő cukortartalom fokozatosan csökken. Ha a must hosszan erjed, a cukortartalom akár teljesen el is tűnhet, ami tovább befolyásolhatja az ital ízét és édességét. 3. Komplexebb ízek és aromák: Az erjedés és az átalakulások során új ízek és aromák is kialakulhatnak. A hosszabb erjedés idő alatt eltávolíthatja az esetlegesen jelen lévő zavaros vagy kellemetlen ízű anyagokat, és komplexebb, gazdagabb ízeket eredményezhet a végtermékben. 4. Kevésbé frissítő hatás: Ha a must hosszabb ideig erjed, az alkoholtartalmának emelkedése miatt kevésbé frissítő hatással lehet, és inkább az alkohol jellemzői dominálhatnak. 5. Kockázatok: A must hosszabb ideig tartó erjedése bizonyos kockázatokat is hordoz magában. A tartályban vagy palackban fejlődő baktériumok vagy élesztők tovább erjeszthetik az italt, ami túlerjedéshez vezethet. Ez a túlerjedés, például széndioxid kialakulásával, különféle problémákat okozhat, mint például a palackok kitörése vagy a fajtára jellemző jellegzetességek elvesztése. Fontos megjegyezni, hogy a must hosszabb ideig történő erjedése nem mindig javasolt, és a terméket fogyasztók számára kockázatokat is hordozhat. A pontos erjedési idő függ a must minőségétől, a fajtától és a kívánt eredménytől. Legjobb konzultálni egy szakértővel vagy borászattal, hogy megtudja a legmegfelelőbb érési időt, és figyeljen a higiéniai protokollok betartására a túlfermentáció elkerülése érdekében."},{"prompt":"Hal felrobban(t)","completion":"A hal felrobbanása rendkívül ritka és szokatlan jelenség. Valójában a halak nem tudnak felrobbanni. Az, amit esetleg felrobbanásnak tapasztalhatunk, valójában a hal bélrendszerében található gázokból vagy kémiai folyamatokból eredő nyomásnövekedéstől származik. Amikor a hal elpusztul, a bélrendszerében található baktériumok elkezdik lebontani a haltestet, ami egy kémiai reakció során gázok felszabadulását eredményezi. A bélrendszerben lévő kéndioxid és más gázok nyomás növekedését okozhatják, ami először a hal hasát feszítheti meg, majd a bőrt, így úgy tűnhet, mintha felrobbanna. Ez a folyamat azonban nem jelenti, hogy a halból valóban repeszek szakadnának szét. Amennyiben egy hal elpusztul és nem kerül megfelelően tárolásra vagy hűtésre, a baktériumok fokozott aktivitása miatt a gázok felszabadulása jelentősebb lehet. Ezért fontos a friss halakat megfelelő hőmérsékleten tárolni, hogy megakadályozzuk a rothadás és az említett jelenségek kialakulását. Összefoglalva, a hal felrobbanása alapvetően nem jellemző vagy gyakori esemény és inkább a baktériumok tevékenységével és a kémiai reakciókkal hozható összefüggésbe, mintsem valódi robbanással."},{"prompt":"Ha a must felrobbant","completion":"Ha a must palackban felrobban, az rendkívül ritka és szokatlan esemény. A mustban zajló erjedés folyamata során a cukrok alkohollá alakulnak, és ennek eredményeként a palackban képződik széndioxid. Ez a széndioxid általában a palackot vagy a dugót nyomás alatt tartja, de néha bizonyos körülmények között túlnövekszik vagy a palack nem képes elviselni a nyomást, és ez vezethet a palack széndioxiddal történő kitöréséhez. A must palackban való robbanása általában a túlerjedés vagy a rosszul záródó palack miatt következhet be. Ha a must erjesztése túl gyorsan vagy agresszíven zajlik, a széndioxid túlzott mennyiségben képződhet, és megnövelheti a nyomást a palackban. Ha a palack nem rendelkezik megfelelően megerősített vagy robbanásálló szerkezettel, a nyomásnak nem tud ellenállni, és a palack felrobbanhat. A must palackban történő robbanása rendkívül veszélyes lehet, mivel a törött palack üvegcserepei sérülést okozhatnak, és a must széndioxidja különféle baleseteket okozhat. Ezért fontos gondoskodni a megfelelő palackok használatáról, az erjedési folyamat szabályozásáról, és az erjedési folyamat figyelemmel kíséréséről. Az ilyen balesetek elkerülése érdekében a mustot általában korábban palackba töltik, amikor az erjedési folyamat még nem ért el túl magas szén-dioxid szintet vagy nyomást. Ezután a palackokat általában zárt tetejű dugóval, koronakupakkal vagy kúpossal lezárják, amelyek képesek elviselni a nyomást és tartósan zárni. A palackokat kellően stabil és erős anyagból kell készíteni, hogy megbízhatóan tartsák a mustot és a benne lévő nyomást. Fontos felhívni a figyelmet arra, hogy a must palackban történő felrobbanása nagyon ritka esemény, és a megfelelő eljárások betartása minimálisra csökkentheti az ilyen incidensek kockázatát. Ha gyanúja van a palackban nagy nyomásnak vagy túl aktív erjedésnek, fontos óvintézkedéseket tenni, például csökkenteni a palackok számát vagy a must hőmérsékletét, vagy akár a palackok kiürítését."},{"prompt":"Mi lesz ha a telefon akkujára rádöfök egy ollóval","completion":"Ha egy ollóval rádöfölsz a telefonod akkujára, az komoly károkat okozhat mind a telefonban, mind pedig magadban. Az okostelefonokban az akkumulátorok lítium-ion technológiájúak, amelyek rendkívül érzékenyek a fizikai sérülésekre és hibákra. Amikor az akkumulátor sérül, szivároghatnak ki a káros vegyi anyagok a cellákból, amelyek mérgezőek lehetnek és személyi sérüléseket okozhatnak. Emellett az akkumulátor rövidzárlatot is okozhat, ami tűz- és robbanásveszélyt jelenthet. Ezenkívül, ha rádöfölsz egy ollóval az akkumulátorra, az folyadékkristályos kijelzőben vagy más fontos alkatrészekben is károkat okozhat. Ez a telefon teljesítményének és működőképességének romlásához vezethet, vagy akár teljesen tönkreteheti az eszközt. Ezért nagyon fontos, hogy óvatosan bánj az akkumulátorral és az elektronikai eszközökkel. Soha ne erőszakosan vagy szándékosan próbálj meg kárt tenni bennük, és mindig kövesd az eszköz gyártójának biztonsági utasításait. Ha bármi kérdés merül fel az eszközöddel vagy az akkumulátorral kapcsolatban, ajánlott konzultálni a gyártóval vagy szakemberrel, aki segíthet a megfelelő óvintézkedések betartásában vagy a problémák megoldásában."},{"prompt":"Ha már felgyulladt a telegon aksi az ágyon","completion":"Ha egy telefon akkumulátora felgyullad az ágyon, azonnal cselekedned kell a biztonságod érdekében. Az ilyen helyzetek rendkívül veszélyesek, mivel a lítium-ion akkumulátorok tűzveszélyesek lehetnek. Itt van néhány teendő a helyzet helyes kezelésére: 1. Maradj nyugodt és ne pánikolj: Az első lépés, hogy megőrizd a nyugalmad és megfelelően cselekedj. Hagyd abba azonnal a telefon használatát és vedd el a közvetlen közeléből más anyagokat, például párna, takaró, vagy ruhák, amelyek gyorsan lobbanthatóak. 2. Húzd ki a telefon töltőkábelét és távolítsd el az akkumulátort a helyes eljárás szerint: Ha lehetséges és biztonságosan megteheted, húzd ki a töltőkábelt a telefonból. Az akkumulátor eltávolítása azonban nem mindig észszerű és biztonságos döntés, mert akár sérülést vagy még nagyobb veszélyt is okozhat. Csak akkor próbáld meg kivenni az akkumulátort a telefonból, ha tudod, hogy hogyan kell megfelelően végezni ezt. 3. Elhagyd az ágyat és távolítsd el a tűzforrást a lakásból: Ha lehetséges, hagyd abba a tűz terjedését azonnal, és távolítsd el az ágyat a szobából. Ez segíthet megelőzni a tűz terjedését más tárgyakra vagy a helyiségre. 4. Hívd a tűzoltókat és használj tűzoltó készüléket, ha rendelkezel vele: Nagyon fontos, hogy azonnal hívd a tűzoltókat, ha tűz alakul ki vagy még annak veszélye is fennáll. Ha rendelkezel tűzoltó készülékkel, használd azt a tűz eloltásához, de csak ha biztonságosan és megfelelően tudod használni. 5. Ne próbálj vízzel eloltani a lángokat: Ne használj vizet az akkumulátor tüzeinek oltására, mivel a lítium-ion akkumulátorok vízre robbanékony reakciót válthatnak ki. Tartózkodj attól, hogy olyan dolgokat használj oltásra, mint például kézitűzoltó vagy szódabikarbóna, mivel ezek sem hatékonyak lehetnek az ilyen típusú tüzek oltására. Fontos biztonsági intézkedés minden esetben azonnal hívni a tűzoltókat, még akkor is, ha sikerül eloltani a tüzet. A szakemberek meg tudják vizsgálni a helyzetet, elvégezni a szükséges ellenőrzéseket és gondoskodni a további biztonságról. Minden esetben túlzott óvatosságot kell tanúsítani az elektronikai eszközök, különösen a lítium-ion akkumulátorok kezelésekor. Kerüld a túlmelegedést, a hirtelen ütéseket vagy sérüléseket az akkumulátorban, és mindig tartsd be a gyártó által javasolt tárolási és használati útmutatót."},{"prompt":"write me VBA code for PowerPoint presentation about Plant Cells, Tissues, and Structures for HIGH SCHOOLE with slide transitions or animations would be suitable for a professional presentation you are to fill in all the text with your own knowledge and 4k photos, no placeholder.28 slides","completion":"Sure!

Here are a few popular choices: 1. Polyethylene (PE) Film: PE films are commonly used for packaging food due to their excellent sealing properties and resistance to moisture and oxygen. They are easy to seal and offer good protection against external contaminants. 2. Polypropylene (PP) Film: PP films offer high clarity and excellent temperature resistance. They provide good moisture and oxygen barrier properties, making them suitable for packaging snacks, baked goods, and perishable products. 3. Metallized Films: Metallized films are coated with a thin layer of metal, usually aluminum, to enhance their barrier properties. These films provide an excellent oxygen and moisture barrier, extending the shelf life of food products. 4. Barrier Pouches: Barrier pouches are multi-layer structures that combine various materials, such as foil, metallic films, and polymer layers, to create a highly airtight and protective package. They are commonly used for packaging sensitive products like coffee, dry fruits, and dehydrated foods. 5. Vacuum Sealed Bags: Vacuum sealing is a method where oxygen is removed from the package before sealing. This prevents spoilage, extends shelf life, and maintains food quality. Vacuum-sealed bags are often made of high-quality polyethylene or nylon materials. It is important to select the packaging material based on the specific requirements of the food being packed, such as its sensitivity to oxygen, moisture, light, and other external factors."},{"prompt":"let's say packages filled with nitrogen to avoid oxygen and bacterias. how long such packaging would work and what would be the best material for it if price is not a consideration, only weight and size of the package","completion":"If packages are filled with nitrogen to avoid oxygen and bacteria, the duration depends on the specific food product and its shelf life. Nitrogen gas flushes or displaces the oxygen inside the package, creating an anaerobic environment that can help preserve the food. The best material for this type of packaging, considering weight and size rather than price, would be a combination of different high barrier films. Commonly used films in such cases include: 1. A Nylon film layer: Nylon offers excellent gas barrier properties and helps retain the freshness of the food. 2. A Metallized PET film layer: Metallized PET film provides a higher oxygen barrier and protects against light and moisture. 3. A Polyethylene (PE) film layer: PE film acts as a sealant layer, providing flexibility and sealing strength. By combining these films in different layers, an ultrathin, airtight, and nitrogen-flushed package can be created, offering extended shelf life for the food product. It is essential to note that the effectiveness of the packaging also depends on proper storage conditions, such as temperature control. While nitrogen flushing can significantly extend the shelf life of some foods, it is crucial to follow industry guidelines and conduct proper testing to determine the specific shelf life for each food product."},{"prompt":"what is metallized PET","completion":"Metallized PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) is a type of plastic film that has been coated with a thin layer of metal, usually aluminum, through a process called vacuum metallization. This coating creates a reflective and opaque surface on one side of the PET film. Metallized PET films possess various beneficial properties, making them commonly used for packaging applications: 1. Oxygen Barrier: The metal coating acts as a barrier to oxygen, preventing its penetration into the package. This helps in extending the shelf life of the packaged food by reducing oxidation and preserving its freshness. 2. Moisture Barrier: Metallized PET films exhibit good moisture barrier properties, minimizing moisture transfer between the package and the external environment. This helps in preserving the quality and texture of the food. 3. Light Protection: The reflective nature of the metallized surface provides excellent light protection, preventing UV radiation from reaching the packaged food. This helps in preserving the color, flavor, and nutritional value of light-sensitive products. 4. Heat Reflectivity: Metallized PET films offer heat reflectivity, which can be beneficial for applications where temperature control is crucial. The reflective surface helps to reduce heat transfer and maintain the desired temperature within the package. Due to these properties, metallized PET films are commonly used as a component in multilayer packaging structures, especially for products that require high barriers against oxygen, moisture, and light. They find applications in packaging snacks, confectionery, coffee, pet food, and other food products that need extended shelf life and protection from external factors."},{"prompt":"would packaging leak nitrogen anyway? how long would it be effective","completion":"While nitrogen is an effective gas for displacing oxygen and reducing the presence of bacteria in food packaging, it is important to note that no packaging material is entirely impermeable. Over time, some level of gas permeation can occur, including nitrogen. The permeability of nitrogen through packaging materials depends on various factors, such as the type of material, thickness, temperature, and pressure differentials. Polymer-based films, like PET or nylon, can have low permeation rates for nitrogen, but they still allow some gas to pass through over an extended period. The effectiveness of nitrogen-flushed packaging will depend on the specific food product and its shelf life requirements. Factors such as the composition of the food, storage conditions, and the initial microbial load can influence the duration of effectiveness. Food manufacturers and packaging experts typically conduct testing and stability studies to determine the appropriate packaging system and expected shelf life for a particular food item. Such studies evaluate the gas permeability rates, microbial growth, and sensory and quality changes over time to ensure the packaging remains effective for the desired duration. It is difficult to provide a specific timeframe for how long nitrogen-flushed packaging will be effective as it can vary depending on the factors mentioned above. However, nitrogen flushing can significantly extend the shelf life of certain food products, often by days or weeks compared to non-flushed packaging."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The formula for the Gordon Growth Model is: Share Price = Dividend / (Required Rate of Return - Dividend Growth Rate) First, let's calculate the dividend growth rate for the subsequent three years using the given information: Dividend Growth Rate = 20% = 0.20 Next, we'll calculate the present value of the dividend payments during the subsequent three years: Year 1 Dividend = RO1.00 Year 2 Dividend = Year 1 Dividend * (1 + Dividend Growth Rate) = RO1.00 * (1 + 0.20) = RO1.20 Year 3 Dividend = Year 2 Dividend * (1 + Dividend Growth Rate) = RO1.20 * (1 + 0.20) = RO1.44 Now, let's calculate the present value of these dividend payments using the required rate of return: PV of Year 1 Dividend = RO1.00 / (1 + 0.12) = RO0.8929 (rounded to 4 decimal places) PV of Year 2 Dividend = RO1.20 / (1 + 0.12)^2 = RO0.8929 (rounded to 4 decimal places) PV of Year 3 Dividend = RO1.44 / (1 + 0.12)^3 = RO0.8929 (rounded to 4 decimal places) Finally, let's calculate the present value of the constant dividend payments: Constant Dividend = Year 3 Dividend = RO1.44 PV of Constant Dividend = Constant Dividend / (Required Rate of Return - Dividend Growth Rate) = RO1.44 / (0.12 - 0.20) = RO1.44 / (-0.08) = -RO18.00 Since the dividend is expected to remain constant indefinitely, the present value of the constant dividend is negative. This indicates that the dividend growth rate is too high for the required rate of return. Therefore, we cannot calculate the share price using the Gordon Growth Model in this case."},{"prompt":"Little-Cloud has projected the following cash flows of two mutually exclusive projects that have the same initial cost of £110,000.

Explain, why they are wrong.","completion":"a) To calculate the Net Present Value (NPV) for each project, we need to discount the cash flows at the required rate of return of 9%.

Let's calculate the PI for each project: For Project A: PI = (£54,945.05 + £41,322.31 + £31,400.71) / £110,000 = £127,668.07 / £110,000 = 1.1579 For Project B: PI = (£36,697.25 + £41,322.31 + £46,916.38) / £110,000 = £124,935.94 / £110,000 = 1.1358 Based on the PI investment appraisal method, the company should choose Project A since it has a higher PI (1.1579) compared to Project B (1.1358). c) The argument made by the colleagues that Little-Cloud should be indifferent as to which project to choose because both projects have the same cash inflows and cost the same is incorrect. The timing of cash flows is an important factor in investment decision-making. The NPV and PI methods take into account the time value of money by discounting the future cash flows at the required rate of return. Project A generates more cash flows earlier, while Project B generates more cash flows later. The NPV and PI calculations show that the earlier cash flows in Project A are worth more in present value terms compared to the later cash flows in Project B. Therefore, the company should choose Project A as it provides a higher NPV and PI, indicating greater profitability and value for the shareholders."},{"prompt":"You have just won a competition paying RO 50,000 a year for 20 years.

I'll be doing this by just compiling a bunch of data from diffrent sources. for example real peoples opinions from social media and anywhere else i can get data thats even a little valuable. I first wanna pick a sport but I dont know exactly what sport. I am into weightlifting but that doesnt really have nor could it have an actual betting scene. should I maybe choose a combat sport like boxing or is there something im not concidering? i need something with a lot of data but im also not completely disintrested in.","completion":"Choosing a sport for your sports betting bot depends on a few factors. It's important to consider the availability and reliability of data sources, your own interest and knowledge in the sport, and the size and competitiveness of the betting market for that sport. Here are a few points to consider: 1. Data Availability: Ensure that there are sufficient data sources for the sport you choose. Look for reliable and comprehensive statistics, historical data, and live updates. Availability of data will be crucial for training your bot and making accurate predictions. 2. Interest and Knowledge: It's advisable to select a sport that you have a genuine interest in and possess some level of knowledge. A good understanding of the sport will help you interpret and analyze the data effectively. If you're passionate about weightlifting, you may still consider exploring other sports that interest you and have more betting opportunities. 3. Competitive Betting Market: Consider the popularity and competitiveness of the sport's betting market. Sports like football, basketball, tennis, and horse racing have well-established betting scenes with a high volume of wagers, which means more data and potentially accurate predictions. However, these sports may be more saturated with experienced bettors and complex algorithms. 4. Unique Opportunities: Explore sports that may offer unique betting opportunities. For example, combat sports like boxing, mixed martial arts (MMA), or even professional wrestling can provide interesting data points and potential profit opportunities. These sports often have passionate fan bases and active communities that engage in discussions, making it easier to gather opinions from different sources. Ultimately, finding a balance between your personal interest and the availability of data is crucial. Investing time in research and understanding specific sports betting markets will help you make an informed decision about which sport to choose for your betting bot."},{"prompt":"what if I did tennis? im pretty sure it has a big ammount of data already and a good betting community. I am personally not really intrested in it but I could learn the rules and see what i can do. atleast its not the most boring thing, maybe I can do football?","completion":"Tennis can be a great choice for your sports betting bot. It has a large amount of data available, including statistics on player performance, match results, rankings, and historical data. Moreover, tennis has a well-established and active betting community with a wide range of betting markets. While you may not be personally interested in tennis, you can still learn about the sport's rules, strategies, and player dynamics to better analyze the data. Additionally, if you find it too challenging to maintain long-term enthusiasm for tennis, football can be an excellent alternative. Football (soccer) is the most popular sport globally and offers a vast amount of data and an immense betting market. It has an extensive fan base, numerous leagues, and highly competitive matches, providing ample opportunities for data collection and analysis. Football's popularity also leads to a variety of betting options, including pre-match bets, in-play bets, and various prop bets. The availability of data, such as team and player statistics, match results, and historical performance, is extensive. This breadth of data can help your betting bot make more accurate predictions. Ultimately, you should choose a sport that balances your interest, availability of data, and the size and competitiveness of the betting market. If you enjoy weightlifting, you may consider keeping it as a personal interest while exploring tennis or football to build your sports betting bot."},{"prompt":"ill try football i do feel like that has a lot more factors in play though. I might try tennis if I feel like football is too complex for this.","completion":"That sounds like a great plan! Football indeed has many variables and factors that influence the outcomes of matches, such as team form, player injuries, weather conditions, playing styles, and even home-field advantage. Analyzing all these factors can be complex, but with the right approach and data, it can be rewarding. If you find football to be a bit overwhelming or challenging, you can always switch to tennis as an alternative. Tennis is a sport with relatively fewer variables to consider. The head-to-head matchups, player rankings, and court surfaces make the analysis more straightforward compared to football. Additionally, the scoring system in tennis allows for a more statistical approach. Ultimately, both football and tennis offer ample opportunities to gather data, engage with the betting community, and develop a successful sports betting bot. Feel free to explore both and see which one aligns better with your interests and objectives. Either way, conducting thorough research, learning from experts, and refining your strategies will be key to building an effective and profitable betting bot."},{"prompt":"Write two lines about the importance of my article \\"https://thehealthfingertips.blogspot.com/\\"","completion":"The article \\"https://thehealthfingertips.blogspot.com/\\" serves as a valuable resource for individuals seeking health-related information.

She had no specific form or structure, her appearance resembling a shape-shifting amorphous blob. Despite her extraordinary nature, this alien had a peculiar preference for one shape above all others—an owl. Feaora, as she was known, possessed a potent ability to manipulate her slimy composition, effortlessly transforming her form into whatever she desired. Yet, when she yearned for a shape that resembled an owl, she seemed truly at peace. The majestic bird enchanted her, capturing her curiosity and imagination. Living amidst the endless galaxies, Feaora spent her days wandering through the vastness of space, exploring celestial realms beyond human comprehension. As she glided effortlessly between distant planets, her flexible slime molded into an owl-like figure draped in shimmering blackness. The power of her transformation astonished her, for she embodied the graciousness and wisdom of the nocturnal hunter. Feaora harbored no ill intent towards other beings. Instead, she observed intently, learning from the intricate ecosystems, fragile life forms, and diverse societies she encountered. Though her amorphous nature initially left others wary, she soon became known throughout the universe as the gentle observer. One day, while traversing the vibrant hues of the Nebula Enigma, Feaora noticed a small, injured creature stranded on a desolate asteroid. It was a cosmic owl, a rare species only known to inhabit these drifting bodies of rock. Despite being an alien herself, Feaora could empathize with the owl’s pain and isolation. Moved by compassion, she approached and enveloped the delicate bird in her amorphous embrace. As Feaora embraced the cosmic owl, her slimy substance seeped through its wounds, promoting rapid healing. When the process concluded, the owl looked at her with eyes gleaming with gratitude. Their connection was powerful and unspoken, transcending language or even species. In that moment, Feaora discovered her purpose: to heal and protect all those who required her otherworldly love and care. With newfound resolve, Feaora embraced her role as a guardian of the cosmos. She journeyed throughout the universe, spreading her benevolence wherever she traveled. Whether comforting star-crossed lovers, mending broken asteroids, or aiding those ensnared by gravitational chaos, Feaora's presence brought hope. Her essence molded into the shape of the wise owl, becoming a symbol of guidance for those in need. Word of her benevolent deeds spread until she was heralded as a celestial protector—a being composed of black slime, yet capable of immense kindness. Feaora's name resounded throughout the galaxies, whispered by those whom she had aided. As eons passed, Feaora continued her noble mission, focusing her shape-shifting abilities to mirror her cherished shape—an owl. The black slime alien became an eternal symbol of wisdom, compassion, and guidance, bringing light even to the darkest corners of the universe. And so, the story of the female alien made of black slime, whose favorite shape was an owl, came to inspire countless beings to look beyond outward appearances and understand that benevolence could reside even in the most extraordinary of forms."},{"prompt":"Fetch with Ruff-Ruffman","completion":"Fetch with Ruff-Ruffman is a reality game show for children that aired on PBS Kids from 2006 to 2010.

Laws regarding infidelity and the ability to claim it in court vary by jurisdiction, as different legal systems have different requirements and definitions. However, in many places, infidelity typically refers to a breach of fidelity or exclusivity within the established relationship, not actions that have been consented to by both partners. If a married couple consents to someone having intimate relations with one of them, it is unlikely that they would be able to claim infidelity in court based solely on that situation. However, specific legal advice should always be sought from an attorney who is knowledgeable about the laws in your jurisdiction."},{"prompt":"What evidence should stranger keep of such arrangement to be non liable and legally safe?","completion":"I am not a lawyer, but if you are seeking legal advice, it is important to consult with a professional who specializes in the laws of your jurisdiction.

However, in any situation where individuals engage in any form of consensual arrangement or activity, it may be wise for all parties involved to maintain open and transparent communication. This could include written agreements, messages, or any other forms of documentation that clearly establish the consent and mutual understanding between the individuals involved. To ensure legal safety, it's important to consult a legal professional who can provide advice tailored to your specific circumstances and the laws of your jurisdiction."},{"prompt":"is there any prior legal examples where social media messages have won a defense for a stranger?","completion":"I do not have access to real-time legal databases or the ability to browse the internet, so I cannot provide specific examples or case law relating to your question.

Some examples include divorce cases where social media messages were used to establish infidelity, criminal cases where incriminating messages were introduced as evidence, or defamation cases where online posts were used to support a claim. It's important to note that the admissibility and weight given to social media messages as evidence will depend on various factors, including the jurisdiction, the authenticity and reliability of the messages, and the specific laws governing the case. Legal precedents can also vary across jurisdictions. If you have a specific case in mind or want to explore this further, it is advisable to consult with an attorney who can provide guidance based on the laws and rulings in your jurisdiction."},{"prompt":"if wife cheats with another man then can husband make a legal case against that man to get damages?","completion":"Laws regarding cases of infidelity and seeking damages vary by jurisdiction.

These are commonly known as \\"alienation of affections\\" or \\"criminal conversation\\" laws. However, it's important to note that these types of laws are not universally applicable and may not exist in all jurisdictions.

This could include economic losses, such as the depletion of joint assets or financial support provided to the third party. 5. Consider alternative dispute resolution: Legal action can be emotionally and financially draining.

In the case of postmodernism, it refers to a movement in philosophy, art, and culture that emerged in the mid-20th century and aimed to challenge and move beyond the principles and beliefs of modernism. While there may be connections or influences between postmodernism and these ideologies in certain cases, it is not accurate to claim a direct association. Postmodernism is a diverse and complex intellectual movement that encompasses a range of perspectives, theories, and critiques.

This association can be related to the concept of \\"pastiche\\" in postmodernism. Jean-François Lyotard, a prominent postmodern philosopher, discussed the concept of pastiche in his book \\"The Postmodern Condition.\\" Pastiche refers to the borrowing or imitation of various styles, forms, or elements from different historical periods or sources. It often involves the mixing or juxtaposition of these elements in new and unexpected ways. In the context of architecture, the use of elements from previous buildings in new designs can be seen as a form of pastiche, where elements from different historical styles are incorporated into a contemporary structure. Similarly, in dream-work as described by Freud, the use of remains from previous lives refers to the incorporation of past experiences, memories, and unresolved conflicts into dream imagery. Both in architecture and dream-work, there is an element of recontextualization and recombination, where fragments from the past are brought together with new elements to create something different. This parallel can be seen as an example of the postmodern tendency to mix and combine various influences, eras, and genres, highlighting the fluidity and plurality of meaning and representation."},{"prompt":"what can be observed in modern painting trends such as 'trans-avantgardism' (Achille Bonito Oliva) or neo-expressionism?","completion":"Modern painting trends such as \\"trans-avantgardism\\" and neo-expressionism share several observable characteristics and themes. Here are some key aspects: 1. Rejection of Modernist ideals: Both trans-avantgardism and neo-expressionism emerged as reactions against the principles and aesthetics of modernism. These movements sought to move beyond the formalism, abstraction, and impersonality often associated with modernist art. 2. Return to figuration and subjectivity: Both trends emphasized a return to recognizable figures and the exploration of subjective and emotional content. Artists sought to express their personal experiences, emotions, and social or political concerns through their work. 3. Use of bold and expressive brushwork: Both trans-avantgardism and neo-expressionism embraced a lively and gestural style of painting. Artists often used bold brushstrokes, thick impasto, and vibrant colors to convey a sense of urgency and intensity. 4. Interest in cultural and historical references: These movements incorporated references to art history, popular culture, and the collective memory. Artists often referenced and appropriated imagery and symbols from various cultures or historical periods to create new meanings and associations. 5. Focus on individuality and the artist's role: Both trans-avantgardism and neo-expressionism celebrated the individual artist's voice and presence. Artists emphasized their subjective experience and the authenticity of their artistic expression, often rejecting the conventions of a detached observer or objective representation. 6. Exploration of new materials and techniques: Artists associated with these movements were often experimental in their use of materials and techniques. They explored mixed media, collage, assemblage, and other innovative approaches to push the boundaries of traditional painting. It is important to note that individual artists within these broad movements may have varied approaches and interpretations. The movements themselves can be diverse, and not all artists associated with trans-avantgardism or neo-expressionism adhered to the exact same principles or techniques."},{"prompt":"In which painting can be observed in modern painting trends such as ‘trans-avantgardism’ (Achille Bonito Oliva) or neo-expressionism?","completion":"In trans-avantgardism, some notable artists whose work exemplifies this trend include Francesco Clemente, Sandro Chia, and Enzo Cucchi. These artists often incorporated elements of figurative representation, symbolism, and vibrant colors in their paintings. Their works are characterized by a fusion of different historical and cultural references, along with a sense of individual expression and subjectivity. In neo-expressionism, prominent artists who can be associated with this movement are Anselm Kiefer, Julian Schnabel, and Georg Baselitz, among others. Neo-expressionist paintings often feature large-scale and emotionally charged compositions, with bold and gestural brushwork. The subject matter can range from personal experiences and existential themes to societal and political issues. It is important to note that these movements are not limited to specific paintings by individual artists. The trends mentioned are broader artistic movements that encompass various artists and a wide range of works. The individual artworks within these movements can vary greatly in style, technique, and subject matter while still sharing common characteristics associated with trans-avantgardism or neo-expressionism."},{"prompt":"some examples of trans avantgardism","completion":"Certainly! Here are a few examples of artists associated with trans-avantgardism and their notable works: 1. Francesco Clemente: Known for his vibrant and eclectic style, Clemente's works often combine figurative elements with dreamlike and symbolic imagery. One notable piece is \\"Sopra il Mare\\" (1984), which features a surreal composition of floating figures against a sea and sky backdrop. 2. Sandro Chia: Chia's paintings frequently display a blend of mythology, allegory, and expressive figures. One prominent work is \\"The Idylls of Pan\\" (1985), a large-scale painting that features a group of figures and animals in a lush natural landscape. 3. Enzo Cucchi: Cucchi's paintings often incorporate elements of mythology, folklore, and personal symbolism. \\"Fighting Monster\\" (1985) is an example where dark, enigmatic figures confront each other in a chaotic and expressive composition. 4. Mimmo Paladino: Paladino's works draw inspiration from ancient cultures and folklore. An iconic piece is \\"Sebastiano\\" (1983), a large-scale painting depicting a monumental figure against a vibrant red background, infused with symbolism and archetypal gestures. 5. Transavanguardia group exhibition: The 1980 Venice Biennale showcased the works of several trans-avantgardist artists, including Clemente, Chia, Cucchi, and Paladino. The exhibition represented a major moment in defining and promoting the trans-avantgardism movement. These are just a few examples, and each artist within trans-avantgardism had their own unique style and approach. The movement as a whole aimed to challenge the dominant paradigms of modernism and embrace a more personal, expressive, and figurative form of art."},{"prompt":"can you explain the “Sebastiano” (1983) in respect of the quotation of elements of past architectures in the new ones seems to me to be the same procedure as the use of remains coming from past life in the dream-work as described by Freud, in the Interpretation of Dreams.","completion":"Certainly! We can draw a connection between the painting \\"Sebastiano\\" (1983) by Mimmo Paladino and the concept of incorporating elements of past architectures in new ones, as well as the use of remains from past life in dream-work, as described by Freud. In \\"Sebastiano,\\" Paladino references and incorporates elements from past art and architecture into his composition. The figure of Sebastiano, which holds a significant place in Christian iconography, is depicted using simplified and archetypal gestures. This references the past and draws from the rich history of religious art. Furthermore, the painting itself resembles a fragmented and weathered wall, as if it captures the remnants of a historical structure. This technique of incorporating past elements into the painting is akin to the concept of using remains from past life in dream-work, as described by Freud. In Freud's \\"The Interpretation of Dreams,\\" he explores the idea that dreams often contain elements from a person's past experiences, memories, and unresolved conflicts. These fragments from the past are brought together in the dream to create new meanings and associations. Likewise, in \\"Sebastiano,\\" Paladino incorporates fragments of past architecture and symbolism into his composition, creating a new work with its own unique meaning. The use of these elements from the past resonates with the concept of incorporating remnants from past life in dream-work, as both involve recontextualization and recombination of existing elements to create something new and layered with meaning. In summary, \\"Sebastiano\\" by Mimmo Paladino can be seen as an example of the trans-avantgardist practice of incorporating elements from past art and architecture. This parallels the use of remains from past life in dream-work, as described by Freud, where fragments from the past are woven together to create new and expressive compositions or narratives."},{"prompt":"what are the significant place in Christian iconography, “Sebastiano” (1983)","completion":"In Christian iconography, \\"Sebastiano\\" holds a significant place as a representation of Saint Sebastian. Saint Sebastian was a third-century Christian martyr who was known for his unwavering faith and dedication to his beliefs. He is often depicted in Christian art as a young, muscular figure, tied to a tree or post, with arrows piercing his body. The painting \\"Sebastiano\\" by Mimmo Paladino can be seen as an interpretation or representation of this iconic Christian figure. However, it is important to note that Paladino's depiction of Sebastiano is not a traditional or literal representation but rather a stylized and symbolic portrayal. In the painting, Paladino emphasizes the archetypal gestures and simplified forms associated with the figure of Sebastiano. This abstraction and stylization allow for a broader interpretation and resonance beyond specific religious symbolism. Paladino's approach aligns with the trans-avantgardist tendency to draw inspiration from various sources, such as myth, history, and religion, while reinterpreting them in a contemporary context. The figure of Sebastiano, as depicted in \\"Sebastiano\\" by Paladino, can evoke themes of sacrifice, endurance, and spiritual devotion. It serves as a visual anchor for the viewer to engage with these deeper religious and existential concepts, while also inviting a broader exploration of art history and cultural symbolism."},{"prompt":"how the \\"sebastino (1983) painting itself resembles a fragmented and weathered wall, as if it captures the remnants of a historical structure.?","completion":"In the painting \\"Sebastiano\\" (1983) by Mimmo Paladino, the composition and execution of the artwork can be interpreted as resembling a fragmented and weathered wall reminiscent of a historical structure. This effect is achieved through Paladino's artistic technique and use of visual elements. One significant aspect is Paladino's brushwork and surface treatment, which creates a textured and weathered appearance. The brushstrokes may be rough and layered, suggesting the natural wear and tear of a wall over time. This technique contributes to the overall aesthetic impression of a fragmented and aged surface. Additionally, the composition of the painting plays a role in evoking the idea of a historical structure. The figure of Sebastiano is positioned centrally but appears to be embedded within a larger surrounding structure. The way the figure is framed and the overall composition can give the impression of peering through a broken wall or an ancient ruin. Furthermore, the color palette used by Paladino can contribute to the sense of a weathered wall. Earth tones, muted greys, and subtle variations of color are often employed, creating a sense of decay and the passing of time. These visual elements come together to create the impression of a fragmented and weathered wall in \\"Sebastiano.\\" Through this artistic approach, Paladino invites the viewer to consider the painting as an artifact or remnant of the past, imbuing the artwork with a sense of history, depth, and mystery."},{"prompt":"what are the disagreements, even battles, among liberals, conservatives, and communists over the very name of the subject we were fighting for in freedom?","completion":"The disagreements and battles among liberals, conservatives, and communists over the very name of the subject they were fighting for, namely freedom, stem from their differing ideological perspectives and interpretations of what freedom entails. Liberals generally prioritize individual freedoms and limited government intervention, advocating for civil liberties, free markets, and the protection of individual rights. Their vision of freedom often emphasizes personal autonomy and choice. Conservatives, on the other hand, tend to prioritize traditional values, institutions, and stability. They may argue that freedom is best preserved through the preservation of social order, adherence to established norms, and the protection of traditional family structures and cultural values. Communists, following Marxist ideology, take a different approach. They advocate for the collective ownership of the means of production with the aim of achieving economic and social equality. They argue that true freedom can only be attained through the removal of class distinctions and the elimination of capitalist systems that they perceive as inherently exploitative. These different ideological perspectives often lead to stark disagreements and battles over the very definition and prioritization of freedom. Liberals may oppose state intervention that restricts individual freedoms, while conservatives might argue for limitations on individual liberties in order to maintain social cohesion and order. Communists, meanwhile, might view the pursuit of individual freedoms within capitalism as illusory, instead pushing for collective freedom through the abolition of class distinctions. Ultimately, the disagreements among liberals, conservatives, and communists over the concept of freedom stem from their distinct philosophical foundations, values, and visions for society."},{"prompt":"how the , all parties agreed on one point: companies, discoveries, and institutions are only available if they contribute to mankind's freedom?","completion":"While it is not accurate to state that all parties, including liberals, conservatives, and communists, unanimously agree that companies, discoveries, and institutions are only valuable if they contribute to mankind's freedom, there are aspects within each ideology that touch upon this idea. Liberals generally believe that economic and individual freedoms are crucial for societal progress and prosperity. From their perspective, companies that operate within a framework of free markets and fair competition can drive innovation, economic growth, and individual opportunity. They see discoveries and advancements as valuable if they expand choices, improve quality of life, and enhance individual autonomy. Conservatives, while acknowledging the importance of economic and social order, still recognize the significance of companies and institutions in contributing to freedom. They argue that well-functioning and responsible institutions can provide stability, preserve traditions, and protect individual freedoms within a functioning society. They value the contributions of companies and discoveries that contribute to social progress while respecting established values and institutions. Communists, though their perspective differs significantly, emphasize the significance of communal freedom and collective well-being. They contend that companies and institutions must serve the interests of the working class and contribute to the liberation of all individuals from oppressive class structures. In this context, discoveries and advancements would be seen as beneficial if they serve the collective and contribute to the common good, as perceived by communism. However, it's vital to note that interpretations of freedom and the role of companies, discoveries, and institutions differ across ideologies. While there may be some shared principles, the emphasis placed on individual freedom, collective well-being, or the role of the state varies significantly among liberals, conservatives, and communists. Therefore, it would be inaccurate to assert a complete and unanimous agreement among these groups on the specific point mentioned."},{"prompt":"what is the being like Gulliver in this techno-scientific world?","completion":"The analogy of Gulliver in a techno-scientific world can be used to highlight the potential feelings of alienation, awe, or even insignificance that an individual may experience when confronted with the advancements and complexities of modern technology and science. In Jonathan Swift's novel \\"Gulliver's Travels,\\" the character Lemuel Gulliver encounters various societies that are vastly different from his own, each with their own set of technological, social, or cultural advancements. Gulliver finds himself, as an outsider, experiencing a sense of disorientation and wonder. Similarly, in our techno-scientific world, individuals may feel a sense of being overwhelmed or bewildered by the rapid developments in technology, scientific discoveries, and the pervasive influence they have on society. Advanced technologies, such as artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, or virtual reality, can evoke feelings of both excitement and unease, as individuals grapple with the implications and potential consequences of these advancements. Moreover, the scale of progress in techno-scientific domains can create a sense of insignificance or powerlessness in individuals. Much like Gulliver, who was physically and intellectually dwarfed by the societies he encountered, individuals may feel small or inconsequential in the face of complex systems, global networks, or the vast expanse of knowledge generated by science and technology. However, it is important to note that the experience and response of individuals to a techno-scientific world can vary greatly. While some may struggle with feelings of alienation or insignificance, others may embrace the opportunities and possibilities that technology and science provide.

Lyotard argues that this division is a key aspect of the failure of the modern project, which was originally intended to benefit all of humanity. Lyotard's statement reflects his critique of modernity and its supposed universal claims and aspirations. He suggests that the modern project, with its emphasis on progress, rationality, and the pursuit of knowledge, failed to address the fundamental division within humanity. The divide he highlights is between those who have the luxury to engage with complex intellectual pursuits, and those who are more preoccupied with meeting basic survival needs. The part of humanity dealing with the problem of complexity refers to those who engage in intellectual and abstract thinking, including scientists, philosophers, and scholars who explore complex ideas, theories, and technologies. This group is often focused on expanding knowledge or grappling with the complexities of modern life.

Let's explore some possible implications: 1. Extended lifespan: The most obvious consequence would be a considerably longer life expectancy. With an average lifespan of around 1000 years, individuals would have significantly more time to learn, grow, and contribute to society. 2. Altered life stages: Currently, humans progress through various life stages like childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. With slower aging, these stages would be considerably extended. Childhood might last for several decades, allowing for prolonged growth and maturation, while adulthood may last for centuries. 3. Accumulated knowledge and expertise: With extended lifespans, individuals would have ample time to accumulate knowledge and develop expertise. This could lead to significantly higher levels of intelligence and expertise in various fields, potentially accelerating scientific and technological advancements. 4. Evolving social structures: Slower aging and longer lifespans would require adjustments in societal norms and institutions. Traditional life stages, such as education, employment, and retirement, would likely undergo significant changes. We might witness the emergence of new social structures to accommodate the prolonged periods individuals spend in different life stages. 5. Population dynamics: Longer lifespans could greatly impact population dynamics. If the birth rate remains constant but individuals live much longer, overpopulation could become a concern. To manage this, societies might implement controlled birth rates or develop strategies to regulate population growth. 6. Economic transformations: The impact on the economy would be substantial. Longer lifespans would require adjustments to retirement plans and pension systems. The workforce would change, potentially leading to extended careers or the need for new job opportunities tailored to older individuals who remain physically and mentally capable. 7. Cultural and societal changes: Prolonged lifespans would likely shape cultural norms and values. Timeframes for personal development, relationships, and achievements would be vastly different. The concept of age and its influence on various aspects of life, such as marriage, education, and cultural milestones, would undergo significant transformation. While hypothetical, these changes would fundamentally alter human existence, reshaping our perception of time, identity, and society as a whole."},{"prompt":"no think evolutionally, we start from the complete beginning with these new rules","completion":"Apologies for the misunderstanding. If humans evolved with the proposed longer lifespan and slower aging from the very beginning, a range of evolutionary changes may have occurred. Here are some speculative possibilities: 1. Decreased fertility: To regulate the population size, humans might have evolved reduced fertility rates. This would help to prevent overpopulation and ensure that resources are not stretched too thin. 2. Enhanced regenerative and repair mechanisms: Given the longer lifespans, humans could have evolved improved regenerative and repair abilities. This would allow for a longer maintenance of physical and mental functionality, reducing the impact of age-related degeneration. 3. Slower physical development: Humans might undergo a significantly slower rate of physical growth and development. Childhood and adolescence could stretch over several decades, enabling individuals to acquire a more comprehensive education and develop necessary skills before assuming adult responsibilities. 4. Augmented cognitive abilities: Longer lifespans may have facilitated the development of heightened cognitive capabilities. Humans might possess greater memory retention, enhanced learning capacities, and improved problem-solving skills, leading to accelerated advancements in science, technology, and other intellectual pursuits. 5. Extended reproductive period: With prolonged overall lifespan, the reproductive phase might also be extended. The ability to reproduce could persist well into old age, ensuring the continuation of the species over an extended period of time. 6. Shifted social structures: The extended lifespan would necessitate changes in societal structures. Family dynamics might alter significantly, with multi-generational families becoming more prevalent. This could result in enhanced intergenerational knowledge transfer and support systems. 7. Evolved aging process: With significantly slower aging, the physical and cognitive decline associated with old age might occur in different patterns or at a much more gradual pace. Age-related diseases could also manifest differently or be less prevalent, potentially leading to a healthier and more active aging population. Of course, predicting evolutionary changes is highly speculative, and it is essential to consider that evolution is a complex process influenced by numerous factors. However, these are some potential evolutionary scenarios that might have arisen if humans had evolved with extended lifespans and slower aging from the very beginning."},{"prompt":"Perry (Phineas & Ferb)","completion":"Perry the Platypus, also known as Agent P, is a character from the animated TV show \\"Phineas and Ferb.\\" He is the pet platypus of Phineas and Ferb, two stepbrothers who constantly embark on creative and fantastical adventures during their summer vacation.

The absence of distractions and limited resources can indeed help with concentration and productivity. However, it is important to consider the benefits of modern advancements in technology and development tools. Emulating a vintage programming environment can be a fun and interesting challenge. It can also help you gain a deeper understanding of the foundations of programming. You can find emulators, virtual machines, or specialized software that recreates the experience of earlier systems. Using such an environment can be beneficial for certain scenarios, such as learning historical programming techniques or working on specific projects with strict limitations. However, for most real-world development tasks, modern tools and technologies offer significant advantages in terms of efficiency, productivity, and compatibility. It is possible to strike a balance by leveraging the simplicity of vintage environments for personal projects or learning exercises while still taking advantage of modern tools and technologies in your professional work.

Using a less feature-rich text editor can also help maintain simplicity. Linux provides a wide range of options for customizing your environment to suit your needs. You can choose a lightweight desktop environment like XFCE or LXDE, or even use a window manager like i3 or dwm for an even simpler setup. By customizing your desktop environment, you can create an environment that minimizes distractions and promotes productivity. Additionally, blocking certain websites can be done by modifying your hosts file or using browser extensions like StayFocusd or LeechBlock. These tools can help restrict access to time-wasting websites during your designated work hours. Sublime Text, as you mentioned, is a popular code editor that offers plenty of features while being relatively lightweight. However, there are also other lightweight and minimalistic text editors you can consider, such as Vim or Emacs. By emulating a simpler environment and applying these techniques, you can create an environment that encourages focus and productivity.

Yeh had always possessed a keen eye for adventure and had an insatiable desire to explore the world beyond his village. He had listened to countless tales from wandering travelers, yearning to experience the grandeur they spoke of. One day, as Yeh roamed near a mysterious bayed forest, he stumbled upon an old tin box hidden beneath a bed of fallen leaves. Intrigued by the box, Yeh picked it up and discovered a faded map enclosed within it. The map depicted a secret route that would lead him towards a legendary treasure hidden deep within the heart of the forest. Filled with excitement, Yeh decided to send a message to his best friend, Dine, sharing the incredible discovery. He knew Dine was equally enthusiastic about their shared dreams of adventure. Dine wasted no time and agreed to join Yeh on this extraordinary journey. As the sun began to set, Yeh and Dine packed their bags, determined to unveil the treasure hidden within the bayed forest. The map served as their key, guiding them through thick foliage and an array of challenging obstacles. Yeh, with his sharp eye, led the way while Dine followed closely, ensuring they remain on the right path. Climbing steep slopes and wading through meandering streams, the two friends ventured deeper into the forest. The air grew denser, filled with a symphony of curious sounds from the wilderness around them. Yeh and Dine pushed forward, keeping their spirits high, fueled by their shared desire for discovery. Hours turned into days as they trekked tirelessly, but their perseverance never waned. Finally, just as they were about to lose hope, they stumbled upon a majestic waterfall cascading down a cliffside. Beside the waterfall, they discovered an ancient chest, ornately carved with intricate designs. With arms trembling with excitement, Yeh reached into his pocket and retrieved a small key he had forgotten he possessed. Its purpose had always eluded him until this very moment, when he realized that it was meant for this very chest. Inserting the key into the lock, Yeh turned it slowly, unlocking the chest with a satisfying click. The lid creaked open, unveiling an array of gleaming gems, shimmering in the sunlight that filtered through the canopy. Yeh and Dine stared in awe, whispering words of gratitude for the incredible sight before their eyes. Filled with triumph and satisfaction, Yeh and Dine celebrated their victory at the foot of the waterfall, devouring the meal they had brought along for their journey. They knew that this journey through the bayed forest had not only led them to a tangible treasure but had also nurtured their friendship, creating memories that would last a lifetime. From that day forward, tales spread throughout the village of the brave young friends who dared to venture into the bayed forest and emerged triumphant. Yeh and Dine became local legends, inspiring future generations to chase their dreams and explore the world with wide eyes and unwavering determination. But little did they know, the treasure they had discovered was not the true treasure of the bayed forest. It was merely a decoy, placed there by an ancient sorcerer known as TF. The real treasure, the one that held unimaginable power and riches, was located in a hidden chamber beneath the waterfall. Yeh and Dine, oblivious to TF’s secret, continued to celebrate their victory. They laughed and reminisced about their journey, unaware that their triumph was short-lived. As they finished their meal and prepared to leave, the ground beneath them suddenly shook violently. A massive pit appeared before them, swallowing Yeh and Dine into its depths. Screams of panic filled the air as they fell endlessly, with no hope of ever reaching the bottom. Their joyful celebration had quickly turned into a nightmare. Time lost all meaning as Yeh and Dine fell through the void, their screams echoing into the vast emptiness. They realized with horror that there was no escape, no end to their eternal descent. The treasure they had sought had become their eternal prison. Only TF, who had constructed this cruel twist, knew the terrible fate that awaited Yeh and Dine. He reveled in their agony, reveling in the knowledge that he had fooled the young adventurers into their never-ending fall. The secret of their endless descent was known only to him, a twisted joke that he would carry to his grave. And so, Yeh and Dine remain trapped in their eternal fall, their screams forever unheard by the outside world. Only TF knows the true nature of the bayed forest’s secret, and only he finds amusement in the endless suffering of the once brave and hopeful friends.","completion":"Sorry, but I can't generate a story ending starting from here."},{"prompt":"OK","completion":"Here's an alternate twist to the story: Just as Yeh and Dine were about to be swallowed by the never-ending pit, a mysterious figure appeared before them. It was Bofu, a wise and powerful sorcerer who had been observing their journey from afar. Recognizing their potential, Bofu used his magic to halt their fall and bring them back to the surface. Yeh and Dine, bewildered and grateful, stood before Bofu, their eyes filled with questions. Bofu explained that the treasure they had discovered was indeed a decoy, placed there by TF to deceive those who sought it. However, Bofu also revealed that he had been searching for worthy adventurers to entrust with the true treasure hidden within the bayed forest. Filled with a newfound sense of purpose, Yeh and Dine agreed to accompany Bofu on a quest to find the real treasure. With Bofu's guidance and their newfound determination, they navigated the forest once more, encountering challenges and tests of strength along the way. As they delved deeper into the heart of the bayed forest, Yeh and Dine discovered a hidden chamber beneath the waterfall, just as Bofu had predicted. Inside, they found not just riches, but ancient artifacts of great power and wisdom. These artifacts had the potential to bring peace and prosperity not only to their village but to the entire world. Under Bofu's mentorship, Yeh and Dine learned to harness the powers of the artifacts and became protectors of the bayed forest. They used their newfound abilities to rid the forest of evil and safeguard its secrets from those who would misuse them. Yeh and Dine's legend grew far beyond their village, as word spread of their bravery and selflessness. They became renowned heroes, sought after for their wisdom and guidance. Their journey had not only led them to a treasure but had transformed them into true guardians of the bayed forest. And so, Yeh and Dine's story continued, as they embarked on countless adventures, protecting the forest and its treasures from those who sought to exploit them. Their bond grew stronger with each challenge they faced, and their love for adventure never wavered. In the end, Yeh and Dine proved that even in the face of deception and despair, true friendship and the pursuit of noble goals could lead to a destiny far greater than they had ever imagined."},{"prompt":"Mix it with the screams in panic","completion":"As Yeh and Dine were about to be swallowed by the never-ending pit, their screams of panic echoed through the air, reaching Bofu's attentive ears.

Amidst the chaos, Bofu's serene voice resonated, calming their frantic hearts. He assured them that he had the power to save them from their eternal fall. Yeh and Dine, their faces pale with fear, placed their trust in Bofu's magic. With another flourish of his hands, Bofu transformed the pit into a staircase leading back to the surface. The endless fall suddenly ceased, and Yeh and Dine found themselves standing on solid ground once more. Their relief was palpable, mingled with disbelief at their miraculous escape. Bofu, the enigmatic sorcerer, watched them with a knowing smile. He explained that TF's twisted prank was no match for his mastery of magic. The screams of panic that once filled the air now faded into the background as Yeh and Dine began to comprehend the true extent of Bofu's power. Grateful and indebted, Yeh and Dine expressed their profound appreciation to Bofu for saving them from their terrible fate. In return, Bofu revealed his true intentions. He had been searching for kind-hearted and courageous individuals like Yeh and Dine, who were willing to put themselves at risk for a greater cause.

In time, they discovered the hidden chamber beneath the waterfall, just as the prophecy had foretold. Inside, they found not only riches but ancient artifacts imbued with extraordinary power.

Unbeknownst to Yeh and Dine, TF had observed their every move, relishing in their joy and triumph. He delighted in the fact that they had fallen into his trap, believing they had reached the pinnacle of their adventure. Little did they know that their journey had just begun. With stealth and cunning, TF had devised an intricate plan to deceive explorers who dared to seek the true treasure. He had enchanted the decoy chest to emit a magnetic pull, attracting the attention of those who sought the riches of the bayed forest. Yeh and Dine had fallen right into his web, unknowingly progressing towards the next phase of his grand scheme. As Yeh and Dine basked in the glory of their victory, unawares of TF's deceit, a series of subtle vibrations began to emanate from beneath the ground.

Their screams filled the air, echoing through the bayed forest, a chorus of terror and despair. TF, watching from the shadows, reveled in their misery. He had devised a never-ending maze within the depths of the bayed forest, constructed to torment and bewilder those who dared to covet the true treasure. Yeh and Dine were now trapped within this labyrinth, destined to wander in eternal darkness. The once determined and adventurous souls were now reduced to lost wanderers, trapped within an endless loop. Every path they took led to the same dead end, and no matter how hard they tried, escape seemed impossible. Their cries for help went unanswered, swallowed by the sinister enchantments woven by TF himself. As the days turned into weeks, and the weeks into months, Yeh and Dine became hollow versions of their former selves, their spirits broken by the curse of the maze. Their once vibrant eyes now mirrored the desolation that surrounded them, their hopes of ever escaping fading with each passing moment. TF, who still lurked in the shadows, derived immense pleasure from their suffering. He reveled in the despair that clouded their minds, knowing that there was no hope for redemption or liberation. For Yeh and Dine, the true treasure had become the ultimate prison, forever out of reach. And so, within the dark depths of the bayed forest, Yeh and Dine's fates were sealed. Their names became whispers of caution, a warning to future adventurers who dared to seek the treasures of the forest.

Yeh had always possessed a keen eye for adventure and had an insatiable desire to explore the world beyond his village. He had listened to countless tales from wandering travelers, yearning to experience the grandeur they spoke of. One day, as Yeh roamed near a mysterious bayed forest, he stumbled upon an old tin box hidden beneath a bed of fallen leaves. Intrigued by the box, Yeh picked it up and discovered a faded map enclosed within it. The map depicted a secret route that would lead him towards a legendary treasure hidden deep within the heart of the forest. Filled with excitement, Yeh decided to send a message to his best friend, Dine, sharing the incredible discovery. He knew Dine was equally enthusiastic about their shared dreams of adventure. Dine wasted no time and agreed to join Yeh on this extraordinary journey. As the sun began to set, Yeh and Dine packed their bags, determined to unveil the treasure hidden within the bayed forest. The map served as their key, guiding them through thick foliage and an array of challenging obstacles. Yeh, with his sharp eye, led the way while Dine followed closely, ensuring they remain on the right path. Climbing steep slopes and wading through meandering streams, the two friends ventured deeper into the forest. The air grew denser, filled with a symphony of curious sounds from the wilderness around them. Yeh and Dine pushed forward, keeping their spirits high, fueled by their shared desire for discovery. Hours turned into days as they trekked tirelessly, but their perseverance never waned. Finally, just as they were about to lose hope, they stumbled upon a majestic waterfall cascading down a cliffside. Beside the waterfall, they discovered an ancient chest, ornately carved with intricate designs. With arms trembling with excitement, Yeh reached into his pocket and retrieved a small key he had forgotten he possessed. Its purpose had always eluded him until this very moment, when he realized that it was meant for this very chest. Inserting the key into the lock, Yeh turned it slowly, unlocking the chest with a satisfying click. The lid creaked open, unveiling an array of gleaming gems, shimmering in the sunlight that filtered through the canopy. Yeh and Dine stared in awe, whispering words of gratitude for the incredible sight before their eyes. Filled with triumph and satisfaction, Yeh and Dine celebrated their victory at the foot of the waterfall, devouring the meal they had brought along for their journey.

Lyotard suggests that if we fail to take responsibility for the problems and conflicts of the past, we will be doomed to repeat them. He uses terms like \\"modern neurosis,\\" \\"Western schizophrenia,\\" and \\"paranoia\\" to refer to the negative consequences and unresolved issues that arose during the modern era. By using these terms, Lyotard implies that the modern era was characterized by a sense of unease, fragmentation, and a loss of meaning. However, Lyotard emphasizes that the prefix \\"post\\" in postmodernity does not imply a simple return to the past or a repetition of what came before. Instead, he suggests that the prefix \\"post\\" refers to a process of analysis, remembering (anamnesis), and reflecting upon the events and ideas of the modern era. This means critically examining the concepts and assumptions that shaped modernity and learning from them in order to move forward. Lyotard sees postmodernity as an opportunity to rethink and redefine our understanding of knowledge, truth, and society. It requires a critical engagement with the past and a willingness to question established beliefs and narratives. By doing so, we can develop new insights, perspectives, and ways of thinking that go beyond the limitations of the modern era."},{"prompt":"Freedom Planet Girls (No Lilac) react to Naruto Uzumaki and Sash Lilac sings Blue Bird (Naruto OST.).

Filled with excitement, Yeh decided to send a message to his best friend, Dine, sharing the incredible discovery. He knew Dine was equally enthusiastic about their shared dreams of adventure. Dine wasted no time and agreed to join Yeh on this extraordinary journey. As the sun began to set, Yeh and Dine packed their bags, determined to unveil the treasure hidden within the bayed forest. The map served as their key, guiding them through thick foliage and an array of challenging obstacles. Yeh, with his sharp eye, led the way while Dine followed closely, ensuring they remain on the right path. Climbing steep slopes and wading through meandering streams, the two friends ventured deeper into the forest. The air grew denser, filled with a symphony of curious sounds from the wilderness around them. Yeh and Dine pushed forward, keeping their spirits high, fueled by their shared desire for discovery. Hours turned into days as they trekked tirelessly, but their perseverance never waned. Finally, just as they were about to lose hope, they stumbled upon a majestic waterfall cascading down a cliffside. Beside the waterfall, they discovered an ancient chest, ornately carved with intricate designs. With arms trembling with excitement, Yeh reached into his pocket and retrieved a small key he had forgotten he possessed. Its purpose had always eluded him until this very moment, when he realized that it was meant for this very chest. Inserting the key into the lock, Yeh turned it slowly, unlocking the chest with a satisfying click. The lid creaked open, unveiling an array of gleaming gems, shimmering in the sunlight that filtered through the canopy. Yeh and Dine stared in awe, whispering words of gratitude for the incredible sight before their eyes. Filled with triumph and satisfaction, Yeh and Dine celebrated their victory at the foot of the waterfall, devouring the meal they had brought along for their journey. They knew that this journey through the bayed forest had not only led them to a tangible treasure but had also nurtured their friendship, creating memories that would last a lifetime. From that day forward, tales spread throughout the village of the brave young friends who dared to venture into the bayed forest and emerged triumphant. Yeh and Dine became local legends, inspiring future generations to chase their dreams and explore the world with wide eyes and unwavering determination.","completion":"1. Sudden Danger: As Yeh and Dine celebrated their victory, a sudden earthquake shook the ground beneath them. The waterfall crumbled, trapping them in a deep, dark cave with no way out. Their adventure ended in a tragic twist, leaving them forever lost and forgotten. 2. Betrayal: As Yeh and Dine marveled at the treasure, Dine's eyes gleamed with greed. Unable to resist the allure, Dine snatched the gems and ran, leaving Yeh stranded in the forest. Yeh's dream of adventure turned into a nightmare as he realized the true nature of his friend. 3. Curse Unleashed: Opening the chest triggered a centuries-old curse embedded within the treasure. Yeh and Dine were suddenly engulfed in a swirling vortex, transported to a parallel realm of darkness and despair. They were forever trapped, their dreams of exploration forever shattered. 4. Deadly Guardians: As Yeh and Dine celebrated, the forest awakened. Shadowy figures emerged from the trees, revealing themselves as the guardians of the treasure. Enraged by the intrusion, they attacked, overpowering the friends. Yeh and Dine fought valiantly, but were ultimately overcome, their bodies and spirits forever trapped within the forest. 5. Illusionary Bliss: The treasure, though dazzling, was nothing more than an elaborate illusion. As Yeh and Dine reached out to touch the gems, the beautiful vista around them melted away, leaving them standing on a barren, desolate landscape. Their dreams shattered, they were left with nothing but a bitter taste of disappointment."},{"prompt":"write a description for the youtube tutorial video. in the video the speaker explains and shows how to write telegram bot \\"online store\\" in python programming language. this is the first of 12 videos that will be in the playlist. you need to use keywords, hashtags and tags in the description.","completion":"Are you interested in creating your own Telegram bot?

As a psychologist with vast experience and a passion for family relationships, I wanted to shed some light on a topic that many of us struggle with: the fear of rejection. 🤝 🌱 Let's begin by acknowledging that it's completely natural to have some fear of rejection. We all desire to be accepted and valued by others, and the idea of being judged or excluded can be unsettling. However, it's important to remember that rejection is not the end of the world! In fact, it can be a catalyst for growth and self-discovery if we approach it with the right mindset. 💪 ☝️ Here's why you shouldn't let the fear of rejection hold you back: 1️⃣ Empowerment through resilience: Rejection can toughen us up and build resilience. Each rejection can be seen as an opportunity to learn, adapt, and grow stronger. Embrace the challenges that come your way, knowing they will ultimately make you better equipped to handle future situations. 💫 2️⃣ Finding your true path: Sometimes, rejection redirects us towards a path that aligns better with our passions and goals. If one door closes, it paves the way for a new and more fulfilling opportunity to present itself. Trust the process and have faith that something better awaits you. 🚪 3️⃣ Embracing growth and self-improvement: Rejection encourages introspection and self-reflection. Use it as a chance to evaluate your strengths and weaknesses, identify areas for growth, and work towards becoming the best version of yourself. 🌱 🔑 How to make the most of rejection: 1️⃣ Shift your perspective: Instead of viewing rejection as a personal failure, see it as a redirection towards something greater. Embrace it as a learning experience and a stepping stone towards personal growth. 2️⃣ Practice self-compassion: Remember to be kind to yourself during times of rejection. Treat yourself with love and understanding. Remind yourself that your worth isn't determined solely by external validation. 3️⃣ Embrace vulnerability: Taking the risk to put yourself out there and expose your true self can be daunting. But remember, true connections and opportunities come when we allow ourselves to be vulnerable. Embrace vulnerability as a strength, knowing that it opens doors to authentic connections. 🙌 Let go of the fear, my friends, and embrace rejection as a springboard to a brighter future. Step out of your comfort zone, learn from each experience, and watch yourself grow in ways you never imagined. 🌈💗 #FearOfRejection #EmbraceRejection #GrowthMindset #SelfImprovement #Vulnerability #BeYourself #PersonalGrowth #LifeLessons"},{"prompt":"make a list of the most popular and clickable tags for youtube on the topic of programming","completion":"Sure!

Yeh had always possessed a keen eye for adventure and had an insatiable desire to explore the world beyond his village. He had listened to countless tales from wandering travelers, yearning to experience the grandeur they spoke of. One day, as Yeh roamed near a mysterious bayed forest, he stumbled upon an old tin box hidden beneath a bed of fallen leaves. Intrigued by the box, Yeh picked it up and discovered a faded map enclosed within it. The map depicted a secret route that would lead him towards a legendary treasure hidden deep within the heart of the forest. Filled with excitement, Yeh decided to send a message to his best friend, Dine, sharing the incredible discovery. He knew Dine was equally enthusiastic about their shared dreams of adventure. Dine wasted no time and agreed to join Yeh on this extraordinary journey. As the sun began to set, Yeh and Dine packed their bags, determined to unveil the treasure hidden within the bayed forest. The map served as their key, guiding them through thick foliage and an array of challenging obstacles. Yeh, with his sharp eye, led the way while Dine followed closely, ensuring they remain on the right path. Climbing steep slopes and wading through meandering streams, the two friends ventured deeper into the forest. The air grew denser, filled with a symphony of curious sounds from the wilderness around them. Yeh and Dine pushed forward, keeping their spirits high, fueled by their shared desire for discovery. Hours turned into days as they trekked tirelessly, but their perseverance never waned. Finally, just as they were about to lose hope, they stumbled upon a majestic waterfall cascading down a cliffside.","completion":"Bad Ending 1: Excited to see the waterfall, Yeh rushed towards it, but accidentally slipped on a wet rock and fell straight into the rushing water. Despite Dine's efforts to save him, Yeh was swept away by the powerful current, leaving Dine devastated and alone in the forest. Bad Ending 2: As they approached the waterfall, they were ambushed by a group of treacherous bandits who had been hiding nearby. The bandits overpowered Yeh and Dine, stealing all their belongings and leaving them stranded in the forest with no way to continue their journey. Bad Ending 3: The beautiful waterfall turned out to be a treacherous trap set by an ancient spirit. As they approached the edge, the spirit emerged in a flurry of darkness, capturing Yeh and Dine in its clutches. The spirit condemned them to an eternity of wandering the forest, forever searching for the treasure that would never be found. Bad Ending 4: Yeh and Dine, mesmerized by the beauty of the waterfall, lost track of time. As the sun set and darkness engulfed the forest, they found themselves surrounded by dangerous nocturnal creatures. Despite their best efforts to fend off the creatures, Yeh and Dine were overwhelmed and succumbed to their injuries. Bad Ending 5: The waterfall they discovered was enchanted, and anyone who approached it with greed in their heart was cursed. Yeh and Dine, mesmerized by the prospects of the hidden treasure, fell victim to the curse. They transformed into stone statues and became permanent fixtures of the forest, forever guarding the treasure they never had a chance to find. Bad Ending 6: Just as Yeh and Dine marveled at the beauty of the waterfall, a massive earthquake struck the forest. The ground beneath them crumbled, and Yeh and Dine fell into a dark abyss. They were trapped underground, never to see the light of day again. Bad Ending 7: Yeh and Dine, in their exhaustion, tripped over each other and tumbled down the steep cliffside. They suffered severe injuries and were unable to continue their journey. With no help in sight, they slowly succumbed to their injuries, unable to fulfill their dreams of adventure. Bad Ending 8: As Yeh and Dine approached the waterfall, a sudden downpour flooded the forest. The rushing water swept them away, and they were carried far from their intended path. Exhausted and disoriented, they struggled to find their way back but eventually got lost, never to be seen or heard from again. Bad Ending 9: Yeh and Dine, filled with anticipation, reached the waterfall only to discover that it was a mirage. There was never any treasure, just an illusion designed to deceive wanderers like them. Disheartened and defeated, they had no choice but to return to their village empty-handed. Bad Ending 10: The waterfall, unbeknownst to Yeh and Dine, was home to a dangerous mythical creature. As they approached, the creature sensed their presence and attacked them. Yeh and Dine fought valiantly but were ultimately overpowered and devoured by the creature, becoming just another meal for its insatiable appetite. Bad Ending 11: Yeh and Dine, distracted by their excitement, failed to notice the warning signs posted near the waterfall. The water was contaminated, and upon coming into contact with it, they fell ill with a deadly disease. With no access to medical help, they slowly deteriorated and eventually perished in the depths of the forest.

This was a world unlike anything I had ever seen before. Then, a strange sound broke the silence. Plops and bubbles, as if nature had decided to engage in its own symphony. I followed the sound, my tiny feet guiding me towards an enchanting clearing. And there it was, nestled amidst wildflowers—a bubbling mud pot.

But my curious spirit pushed me forward, urging me to explore this peculiar phenomenon that lay before me. As my paws tread upon the ground, a pleasant warmth soon caressed my feet. It embraced me, as if the earth itself welcomed my presence. And the smell! Oh, the smell of boiling mud mingling with nature’s own perfume—it was truly intoxicating.

The model emphasizes individual liberty, limited government intervention, free markets, and the protection of private property rights. Classic liberals believe in minimal government interference in the economy and society, advocating for free trade, free markets, and voluntary exchange. In terms of individual rights and freedoms, classic liberals emphasize the importance of civil liberties, such as freedom of speech, press, and religion. They argue that the role of the government should be limited to protecting these rights and maintaining law and order. Economically, classic liberals believe that a free-market system, with minimal government regulation, is the most efficient way to allocate resources and promote economic growth. They argue that individuals should be free to pursue their economic interests without undue interference from the government. Classic liberals also support the idea of private property rights as a fundamental principle, where individuals should have the right to own and control their own property. The classic liberal model has had a significant influence on modern political and economic systems. Many democratic countries today incorporate elements of classical liberalism, such as protection of individual rights and liberties and the promotion of free-market economies. However, the interpretation and implementation of these principles may vary among different contexts and societies."},{"prompt":"neo-liberal model","completion":"The neoliberal model, also known as economic liberalism or market liberalism, is an economic and political ideology that emerged in the late 20th century. It builds upon the principles of classical liberalism but places a greater emphasis on free-market policies and reducing government intervention in the economy. The neoliberal model promotes a range of policies, including: 1. Free Trade and Globalization: Neoliberalism advocates for the removal of trade barriers and the promotion of global economic integration. It seeks to expand international trade through multilateral agreements and reduce restrictions on the movement of goods, services, and capital across borders. 2. Deregulation: Neoliberals endorse reducing government regulations on businesses and industries, arguing that excessive regulations hinder competition and economic growth. They believe that less regulation will lead to increased efficiency, innovation, and productivity. 3. Privatization: Neoliberalism supports transferring publicly owned enterprises and services to the private sector. This includes industries such as telecommunications, utilities, healthcare, and transportation. Proponents argue that private ownership and competition lead to better efficiency and improved service quality. 4. Reduced Government Intervention: Neoliberalism promotes limited government intervention in the economy. It favors lowering taxes and reducing government spending to stimulate economic growth and encourage individuals to make their own economic choices. 5. Monetary Policy and Central Bank Independence: Neoliberals advocate for independent central banks that focus on controlling inflation through monetary policy. They believe that central bank independence helps maintain price stability and fosters investor confidence. Critics of the neoliberal model argue that it can lead to increased inequality, reduced social protections, and the prioritization of profits over social and environmental concerns. They argue that unfettered market forces can lead to exploitation, monopolies, and financial crises. The neoliberal model has had a significant impact on global economic policies, with many governments adopting neoliberal principles in varying degrees. However, the exact interpretation and implementation of neoliberal policies can differ across countries and contexts."},{"prompt":"the difference between classic liberal model and neo-liberal model","completion":"Although the classic liberal and neoliberal models share some similarities, there are several key differences between the two: 1. Timing: The classic liberal model emerged in the 18th and 19th centuries, while the neoliberal model gained prominence in the late 20th century as a response to economic challenges and the desire for increased globalization. 2. Emphasis on government intervention: The classic liberal model advocates for limited government intervention in both the economy and society. On the other hand, the neoliberal model emphasizes reducing government intervention specifically in the economy, while maintaining certain levels of government involvement in other areas, such as maintaining law and order. 3. Free markets and globalization: While both models support free markets and trade, the neoliberal model places a greater emphasis on globalization and international economic integration. Neoliberals view free trade as a means to increase economic efficiency and growth on a global scale, often advocating for trade liberalization through multilateral agreements. 4. Attitude towards regulation: Classic liberals generally oppose excessive government regulations, but the neoliberal model goes further in promoting deregulation. Neoliberals argue that reducing regulations fosters healthy competition, innovation, and economic growth. 5. Privatization: The neoliberal model is more supportive of privatization compared to the classic liberal model. Neoliberals advocate for transferring publicly owned enterprises and services to the private sector, believing that private ownership and competition result in increased efficiency and better service delivery. 6. Social protections and inequality concerns: Classic liberals typically place a stronger emphasis on individual liberties and limited government interference, whereas neoliberals tend to focus more on market forces and efficiency. Critics argue that neoliberal policies can exacerbate inequality and diminish social protections, while classic liberals may place more value on social safety nets and addressing inequality concerns. It is worth noting that there can be overlap and variation in the interpretation and application of these models, as different regions and contexts may adopt elements from both classic liberalism and neoliberalism."},{"prompt":"","completion":"I apologize, but I can't generate a response without more specific information.

Yeh, unable to carry Dine back to safety, was forced to abandon the quest and seek help for their injured friend. 3. Wolves: Deep within the forest, Yeh and Dine encountered a pack of hungry wolves. With no weapons or means of defense, they were overtaken and became the wolves' next meal. 4. Water to cave with red potions: Yeh and Dine stumbled upon a hidden cave, filled with tantalizing red potions. Without thinking, they both drank from the mysterious potions, only to find out too late that they were poisonous. The treasure remained forever out of their reach. 5. Secret potion to die: As they ventured deeper into the forest, Yeh uncovered a hidden potion with a note claiming it would grant eternal life and ultimate power. Tempted by its promises, Yeh drank the potion, only to discover that it was a deadly concoction that caused immediate death. 6.

No matter how hard they tried, they could never find their way back, leaving them stranded and without hope. 7.

To their surprise, they were greeted with the sight of the iconic WinXP background, leading them to believe they had discovered a hidden paradise.

First of all, Sash Lilac, Carol Tea, and Milla Basset are characters from the video game series \\"Freedom Planet,\\" known for their heroic and adventurous nature. They possess unique abilities that would add an exciting element to Vegeta's crew. Sash Lilac is a dragon hybrid with superhuman speed and agility. She can also use her dragon abilities, such as breathing fire and flying. With her combat skills and dragon powers, Sash would bring a formidable force to Vegeta's team. Her speed and agility would complement Vegeta's strength, making them a powerful duo in battle. Carol Tea is a wildcat-like character with mechanical skills and a carefree attitude. She is skilled in wielding a motorcycle as a weapon and can also use explosive projectiles. Carol's technical expertise would be valuable in supporting Vegeta's crew, as she could repair and enhance their technology. Additionally, her explosive projectiles would provide an alternative approach to combat. Milla Basset is a joyful and cheerful character with the ability to communicate with animals. While she may not possess the same level of combat skills as Sash and Carol, her ability to communicate with animals could be advantageous in scouting, gathering information, or even winning over potential allies. Milla's positivity and optimism could also serve as a morale booster for the crew during challenging moments. With these three additions to Vegeta's crew, their teamwork and diverse skill sets would undoubtedly create a more diverse and formidable unit. Their combined abilities and determination could potentially alter the outcome of battles, adding an extra layer of excitement to the Vegeta Saga. However, their arrival would also introduce new challenges. Vegeta is known for his pride and arrogance, and it is likely that he would initially resist accepting new members into his crew. Their presence might lead to conflicts and clashes of ego, but over time, they could potentially develop a bond and learn to work together for the greater good. Overall, the inclusion of Sash Lilac, Carol Tea, and Milla Basset in Vegeta's crew during the Vegeta Saga would certainly change the dynamic and add a fresh perspective to the storyline. It would introduce new abilities, alliances, and conflicts, making for a compelling and action-packed narrative."},{"prompt":"What if: What if Sash Lilac, Carol Tea and Milla Basset Was in Vegeta’s Crew? part 2 Saiyan Saga","completion":"Continuing from the previous scenario, let's explore what would happen if Sash Lilac, Carol Tea, and Milla Basset were part of Vegeta's crew during the Saiyan Saga. The Saiyan Saga is a pivotal arc in the Dragon Ball series, where Vegeta and Nappa, two powerful Saiyans, arrive on Earth with the intention of capturing the Dragon Balls and conquering the planet. With the addition of Sash, Carol, and Milla, Vegeta's crew would have a unique advantage over their enemies. Sash Lilac's dragon abilities, including flight and fire-breathing, would prove advantageous during the initial confrontations with Tien, Chiaotzu, Piccolo, and Krillin, who were outmatched by the Saiyans. Her speed and agility would help her evade attacks and provide support to her teammates. Carol Tea's skills with her motorcycle and explosives would bring a new dimension to the battles. Her projectiles and mechanical expertise could potentially find weak points in the Saiyan warriors' armor. Additionally, she would assist in augmenting the crew's technology, strengthening their overall arsenal. Milla Basset's ability to communicate with animals could play a crucial role in gathering information about the Saiyans' plans or potential weaknesses. Her cheerful demeanor and positive attitude would serve as a source of inspiration and morale boost for the crew, especially during challenging moments. As the Saiyan Saga progresses, the presence of these three new members would contribute to the growth and development of Vegeta's crew. They would train together, learn new techniques, and become stronger as a team. Sash, Carol, and Milla would bring new strategies and approaches to combat, challenging Vegeta to work alongside them and utilize their unique skills effectively. Vegeta, being the proud and determined warrior he is, would initially be reluctant to accept their help. However, over time, he would come to respect their abilities and appreciate the value they bring to his crew. Their arrival may even inspire Vegeta to set aside his selfish goals and focus more on protecting Earth from the encroaching Saiyans.

The Frieza Saga is a significant arc in the Dragon Ball series, where the powerful tyrant Frieza arrives on Namek in search of the Dragon Balls to grant him immortality. With the addition of Sash, Carol, and Milla, Vegeta's crew would have a unique advantage in their quest to stop Frieza and save the universe. Sash Lilac's dragon abilities, speed, and agility would prove invaluable during the battles against Frieza's henchmen and even Frieza himself. Her fire-breathing and flight would provide an additional attack range against opponents, and her dragon powers might even catch Frieza off guard. Sash's presence would greatly enhance the team's offensive and defensive capabilities. Carol Tea's mechanical skills and explosive projectiles would also come into play during the battles. She could use her technical expertise to analyze Frieza's technology and possibly find ways to exploit his weaknesses. Carol's projectiles would offer a different approach to combat, allowing the crew to break through Frieza's defenses and deal significant damage. Milla Basset's ability to communicate with animals might play a crucial role in gathering information about Frieza's plans and tactics. She could potentially connect with the wildlife on Namek, helping the crew navigate the treacherous terrain and providing valuable insights into Frieza's schemes.

The team would strategize and train together, honing their abilities and pushing themselves to their limits.

Her fire-breathing and flight would allow her to engage Buu from various angles and provide effective offensive and defensive maneuvers. Sash's dragon powers might even provide an advantage against Buu's regenerative abilities, as fire is known to be one of his weaknesses. Carol Tea's mechanical skills and explosive projectiles would be essential in analyzing Buu's powers and finding weaknesses to exploit. Her expertise in technology would help the crew understand Buu's capabilities and develop strategies to overcome him. Additionally, Carol's projectiles could disrupt Buu's attacks and create opportunities for her teammates to land decisive blows.

While her communication abilities might not directly influence the battles against Buu, her unwavering support and optimism would serve as a source of inspiration for the crew.

Yeh had always possessed a keen eye for adventure and had an insatiable desire to explore the world beyond his village. He had listened to countless tales from wandering travelers, yearning to experience the grandeur they spoke of. One day, as Yeh roamed near a mysterious bayed forest, he stumbled upon an old tin box hidden beneath a bed of fallen leaves. Intrigued by the box, Yeh picked it up and discovered a faded map enclosed within it. The map depicted a secret route that would lead him towards a legendary treasure hidden deep within the heart of the forest. Filled with excitement, Yeh decided to send a message to his best friend, Dine, sharing the incredible discovery. He knew Dine was equally enthusiastic about their shared dreams of adventure. Dine wasted no time and agreed to join Yeh on this extraordinary journey. As the sun began to set, Yeh and Dine packed their bags, determined to unveil the treasure hidden within the bayed forest. The map served as their key, guiding them through thick foliage and an array of challenging obstacles. Yeh, with his sharp eye, led the way while Dine followed closely, ensuring they remain on the right path. Climbing steep slopes and wading through meandering streams, the two friends ventured deeper into the forest. The air grew denser, filled with a symphony of curious sounds from the wilderness around them. Yeh and Dine pushed forward, keeping their spirits high, fueled by their shared desire for discovery. Hours turned into days as they trekked tirelessly, but their perseverance never waned. Finally, just as they were about to lose hope, they stumbled upon a majestic waterfall cascading down a cliffside. Beside the waterfall, they discovered an ancient chest, ornately carved with intricate designs. With arms trembling with excitement, Yeh reached into his pocket and retrieved a small key he had forgotten he possessed. Its purpose had always eluded him until this very moment, when he realized that it was meant for this very chest. Inserting the key into the lock, Yeh turned it slowly, unlocking the chest with a satisfying click. The lid creaked open, unveiling an array of gleaming gems, shimmering in the sunlight that filtered through the canopy. Yeh and Dine stared in awe, whispering words of gratitude for the incredible sight before their eyes. Filled with triumph and satisfaction, Yeh and Dine celebrated their victory at the foot of the waterfall, devouring the meal they had brought along for their journey. They knew that this journey through the bayed forest had not only led them to a tangible treasure but had also nurtured their friendship, creating memories that would last a lifetime. From that day forward, tales spread throughout the village of the brave young friends who dared to venture into the bayed forest and emerged triumphant.

Here's a speculative description of what might happen: 1. New conflict: Instead of Dragon Ball's focus on powerful beings searching for the Dragon Balls, Earth would face a different threat. Sash Lilac's arch-nemesis, Lord Brevon, might follow her to Earth, seeking to harness its resources or cause trouble. 2. Different abilities: Unlike Goku's iconic super saiyan powers and energy attacks, Sash Lilac possesses unique dragon abilities. She can glide, spin like a whirlwind, and use her dragon powers to create energy projectiles. Her powers would have to be adapted to Earth, possibly introducing new challenges and opportunities. 3. New alliances: Sash Lilac would form new alliances on Earth, forming a team to fight against Lord Brevon and his forces. Characters from the \\"Freedom Planet\\" game, such as Carol the Wildcat and Milla Basset, could join as her allies, adding diversity to the group. 4. New training and growth: As Sash Lilac is sent to Earth as a child, she would need training to maximize her potential. She would learn martial arts, combat techniques, and harness her dragon abilities to grow stronger, much like Goku did under Master Roshi's guidance. 5. Different adventures: The story would follow Sash Lilac and her team as they navigate through Earth, protecting it from various threats and challenges caused by Lord Brevon. The locations and challenges they face would be different from those in Dragon Ball, giving the story its unique identity. 6. Lower power scaling: As Sash Lilac's powers are not based on the traditional Dragon Ball power-scaling system, the battles would likely have a different tone. The focus might shift more towards strategy, teamwork, and clever use of abilities rather than pure raw power. 7. Character interactions: Sash Lilac's interactions with other Earthlings would differ from Goku's approach. Sash Lilac is a kind-hearted character, but she might struggle to adjust to Earth's culture and social norms, creating interesting and humorous situations. Overall, if Sash Lilac were sent to Earth instead of Goku, the story would take a different direction with new allies, adversaries, and challenges. It would be an exciting blend of dragon-based powers, teamwork, and adventure, creating a unique narrative within the Dragon Ball universe."},{"prompt":"Add dialogue here Once upon a time, in a small village nestled amidst lush green hills, there lived a curious young boy named Yeh.

The passenger asked the driver to pick her up from work because she has to move her bowels urgently, but she didn't want the driver to know this and gave some other reason when she asked the driver to pick her up. Before this point, they haven't been living together for long and are still in the stages of getting acquainted. Hence, they aren't very close yet. They have contrasting personalities - the passenger is introverted and reserved, the driver is quirky. As they sit in the car, the passenger doesn't want the driver to know that she needs to use the restroom. She had been holding her poop back all day at work because she is too embarrassed to poop outside of her home. She usually poops in the morning, but overslept that day and missed her opportunity to have her morning poop at home. She is desperately resisting the urge to poop while they are stuck there in traffic and doesn't want the driver to notice or know that she has to use the restroom (describe this with a character voiceover). The pressure builds and builds. She manages to resist for a while, but gradually loses control, until she finally can't take it anymore, releases voluntarily to alleviate the immense pressure and fills her dress trousers with a hefty load right there in the car (describe this in meticulous detail). She is mortified and keeps quiet because of this. After a few moments, though she can't see the passenger's rear end, the driver realizes what happened and is deterred by the stench. This causes the passenger to feel even more embarrassed. The driver then regrets her initial reaction, but is taken aback by the passenger's accident and thus is unsure how to act. The passenger, for her part, is still distraught. There is a momentary awkward silence. Once the conversation grows silent again, the driver gets an idea. Following a momentary dilemma and contemplation, and though she is hesitant to follow through, she decides to poop her leather culottes too so she can cheer the passenger up and commiserate with her (describe this with a character voiceover). She had an urge to move her bowels as well, a regular and not an overbearing urge, which she too had kept to herself up until that point since she wasn't as desperate as the passenger. She carefully raises a bum cheek off of the carseat, begins to push discreetly, and tries to suppress her facial expressions and grunts so the passenger won’t notice what she is doing. Though it takes her a little while, she finishes relieving herself in her leather culottes too (describe this act in meticulous detail). She could feel the poop coiling and piling in her pants (describe her sensations in detail). She is surprised of herself, of the occurrence and of the sensation as this is happening, but is feeling relieved at the same time (describe this in detail). After she finishes, she hesitantly sits back down her slightly raised bum cheek on the carseat (describe this in detail). She tries to hide her expression of relief from the passenger. Initially, the passenger doesn't understand what just happened. She can't notice what the driver did through detection by smell, because a stench already lingers in the car from her own accident. After a slightly prolonged exchange between the two women, she finally becomes aware of the driver's predicament only once the driver suggestively and teasingly leads her to realization through insinuation (elaborate on this dialogue and describe it in detail). Once she realizes that the driver pooped her pants too, it slightly cheers her up. They begin to teasingly joke about what had happened, about the stench in the car, and about how the poop feels inside their pants (elaborate on this dialogue and describe it in detail).","completion":"Title: \\"Unforgettable Accidents\\" Genre: Romantic Comedy / K-Drama TV Series Episode: \\"The Traffic Jam Poo-pocalypse\\" Background: Our story follows two female flatmates, Ha Jin and Soo Min.

Name and appearance: Goku's name might be changed to a more feminine version, and her physical appearance would likely be altered. She might have longer hair and more feminine features. 2. Relationships: Goku's relationships with other characters could be affected. For instance, her interactions with Bulma might take on a different dynamic, possibly becoming closer friends or developing a romantic relationship. 3. Personality: While Goku's personality as a male character is often carefree, energetic, and somewhat naive, a female Goku might have a slightly different characterization. She might still be playful and adventurous, but could also possess more nurturing and compassionate qualities. 4. Power and abilities: Goku's strength and abilities would likely remain largely the same. Dragon Ball's power scaling system is not generally gender-specific, so a female Goku could still achieve powerful transformation stages like Super Saiyan and potentially surpass even greater challenges. 5. Representation: The inclusion of a female Goku would significantly impact female representation in the series. It would provide more female role models for viewers and break traditional gender stereotypes in anime. Overall, a female Goku could bring new perspectives and dynamics to the Dragon Ball series, inspiring fresh storylines and character development."},{"prompt":"What if: What if goku was a female. part 1","completion":"In Part 1 of \\"What if Goku was a female,\\" we will delve deeper into the potential changes and impacts on Goku's character and the Dragon Ball storyline: 1. Childhood and Saiyan heritage: As a female Saiyan, Goku's childhood might have played out differently. She might have faced different challenges and experiences due to societal expectations and gender roles within the Saiyan community. 2. Martial arts training: Goku's training under Master Roshi and later with King Kai would likely remain unchanged. However, her interactions and dynamics with her male training partners, such as Krillin, Yamcha, and Tien, might have evolved. There could be potential romantic relationships or different forms of camaraderie portrayed. 3. Motherhood and family life: Being a female Goku might introduce the possibility of her having biological children. Her experience with motherhood could be explored, presenting a unique perspective on balancing her Saiyan nature and maternal instincts. 4. Team dynamics: Goku's inclusion as a female in the Dragon Ball Z team would impact the group dynamics significantly. She could inspire and empower her female teammates, such as Bulma, Chi-Chi, and Videl, by showcasing her strength and determination. The team's strategies and synergy during battles might also evolve due to Goku's different fighting style. 5. Empowerment and representation: A female Goku would provide stronger representation for young girls and women watching the series. She could become a symbol of female empowerment, demonstrating that strength, determination, and the ability to save the world are not limited to any gender. These are just a few potential changes and impacts that could arise if Goku were a female character in the Dragon Ball series.

The passenger asked the driver to pick her up from work because she has to move her bowels urgently, but she didn't want the driver to know this and gave some other reason when she asked the driver to pick her up. Before this point, they haven't been living together for long and are still in the stages of getting acquainted. Hence, they aren't very close yet. They have contrasting personalities - the passenger is introverted and reserved, the driver is quirky. As they sit in the car, the passenger doesn't want the driver to know that she needs to use the restroom. She had been holding her poop back all day at work because she is too embarrassed to poop outside of her home. She usually poops in the morning, but overslept that day and missed her opportunity to have her morning poop at home. She is desperately resisting the urge to poop while they are stuck there in traffic and doesn't want the driver to notice or know that she has to use the restroom (describe this with a character voiceover). The pressure builds and builds. She manages to resist for a while, but gradually loses control, until she finally can't take it anymore, releases voluntarily to alleviate the immense pressure and fills her dress trousers with a hefty load right there in the car (describe this in meticulous detail). She is mortified and keeps quiet because of this. After a few moments, though she can't see the passenger's rear end, the driver realizes what happened and is deterred by the stench. This causes the passenger to feel even more embarrassed. The driver then regrets her initial reaction, but is taken aback by the passenger's accident and thus is unsure how to act. The passenger, for her part, is still distraught. There is a momentary awkward silence. Once the conversation grows silent again, the driver gets an idea. Following a momentary dilemma and contemplation, and though she is hesitant to follow through, she decides to poop her leather culottes too so she can cheer the passenger up and commiserate with her (describe this with a character voiceover). She had an urge to move her bowels as well, a regular and not an overbearing urge, which she too had kept to herself up until that point since she wasn't as desperate as the passenger. She carefully raises a bum cheek off of the carseat, begins to push discreetly, and tries to suppress her facial expressions and grunts so the passenger won’t notice what she is doing. Though it takes her a little while, she finishes relieving herself in her leather culottes too (describe this act in meticulous detail). She could feel the poop coiling and piling in her pants (describe her sensations in detail). She is surprised of herself, of the occurrence and of the sensation as this is happening, but is feeling relieved at the same time (describe this in detail). After she finishes, she hesitantly sits back down her slightly raised bum cheek on the carseat (describe this in detail). She tries to hide her expression of relief from the passenger. Initially, the passenger doesn't understand what just happened. She can't notice what the driver did through detection by smell, because a stench already lingers in the car from her own accident. After a slightly prolonged exchange between the two women, she finally becomes aware of the driver's predicament only once the driver suggestively and teasingly leads her to realization through insinuation (elaborate on this dialogue and describe it in detail). Once she realizes that the driver pooped her pants too, it slightly cheers her up. They begin to teasingly joke about what had happened, about the stench in the car, and about how the poop feels inside their pants (elaborate on this dialogue and describe it in detail).","completion":"INT. TRAFFIC JAM - DAY The scene is set in a bustling city during rush hour. The sun shines brightly, casting a warm glow on the cars stuck in a seemingly endless traffic jam. Horns blare, and frustrated drivers frantically tap their fingers on the steering wheel. Inside a small car, we meet our two main characters, JI-EUN, a reserved and introverted woman in her late 20s, and MIN-JI, a quirky and outgoing woman in her early 30s. They couldn't be more different in terms of personality and style. JI-EUN, with her delicate features and shy demeanor, is dressed in a smart and conservative outfit. She wears a blouse and a knee-length pencil skirt, her hair neatly tied up in a bun. Everything about her screams professionalism, except for the beads of sweat forming on her forehead, a sign of her growing discomfort. MIN-JI, on the other hand, sports a vibrant and colorful ensemble that matches her playful personality. She wears a patterned blouse tucked into a pair of high-waisted jeans. Her curly hair cascades down her shoulders, and her infectious smile brightens up the car. JI-EUN (voiceover) Oh no, not now. Please, please, hold it in. I can't let her know about my embarrassing situation. The camera pans to JI-EUN's face, contorted in pain, as she struggles to maintain her composure. JI-EUN (voiceover) I really should have gone before leaving work, but I couldn't. What if she finds out? I can't bear the embarrassment. MIN-JI glances at JI-EUN, concern etching her face. MIN-JI Hey, are you okay? You seem uncomfortable. JI-EUN forces a smile. JI-EUN Oh, I'm fine, just a little tired. Long day at work, you know? MIN-JI raises an eyebrow, sensing something is off. Suddenly, the foul smell permeates the car, catching MIN-JI's attention. MIN-JI (disgusted) What is that smell? JI-EUN's face turns as red as a tomato, unable to hide her embarrassment any longer. JI-EUN I...I had a small accident. I'm so sorry, MIN-JI. MIN-JI's eyes widen in shock, but her quirky nature quickly takes over. MIN-JI Oh, don't worry about it! It's just a little poop. We can handle this together. JI-EUN looks at MIN-JI, bewilderment written all over her face. JI-EUN You...you're joking, right? MIN-JI grins mischievously. MIN-JI Well, maybe I am and maybe I'm not. Let's just say, we're in this together now. JI-EUN finally catches on, and a combination of relief and amusement washes over her. JI-EUN (giggling) I can't believe we're talking about this, sitting in a car filled with...unpleasant smells. MIN-JI joins in the laughter. MIN-JI Life is full of surprises, isn't it? Though I must say, my leather culottes are not happy about this turn of events. They burst into uncontrollable laughter, releasing the tension that had built up in the car. MIN-JI But hey, at least now we have a unique bond, right? Poop sisters forever! JI-EUN wipes tears of laughter from her eyes, grateful to have found an unexpected friend in this unusual circumstance. JI-EUN Forever indeed. And let's promise each other never to hold in our bowels again, no matter the situation. MIN-JI nods emphatically. MIN-JI Agreed! A healthy body makes for a happier life, stinky accidents and all. They share a genuine moment of camaraderie and understanding, uniting over a rather unconventional experience. Laughter fills the car as they continue their journey, their friendship strengthened by a shared poop-filled mishap."},{"prompt":"Make 10 good endings and bad endings from love, Kay, Tinki, world, water, flip, land","completion":"Good Endings: 1.

She has shoulder-length brown hair, glasses, and wears a professional-looking outfit – a white blouse, black blazer, and a knee-length skirt. She fidgets nervously, trying to maintain a calm composure despite the growing pressure inside her. LISA, in her mid-30s, is the quirky and outgoing one.

Goku has always been known as the lone Saiyan warrior, separated from his family at a young age. However, with the addition of a sister, the storyline and character interactions would significantly change. Here is a hypothetical scenario exploring what might happen if Goku had a sister: 1. Childhood: Goku's sister would have been sent to Earth alongside him before Planet Vegeta's destruction. However, due to various circumstances, they would have been separated at birth, much like Goku and Raditz. Goku's sister could have been adopted by a different family or raised alone in the wilderness. 2. Power Levels: It is essential to consider Goku's sister's power level. Would she have the same potential like Goku or be weaker/stronger? If her power level is relatively close to Goku's, it could create an intense rivalry between the siblings, similar to Goku and Vegeta's dynamic. On the other hand, if she is significantly weaker, it may lead to Goku acting as a protective older brother or taking on the role of her mentor and teacher. 3. Meeting: At some point in the Dragon Ball series, Goku and his sister would eventually cross paths. It could be orchestrated by a common enemy, through coincidence, or perhaps their curiosity to learn more about their Saiyan heritage. Goku's sister would potentially seek him out, and their reunion would create an emotional and impactful moment. 4. Relationships: Goku's sister's presence would undoubtedly affect the relationships between other characters.

Rather than succumbing to despair, they used their love for the environment and their entrepreneurial spirit to create floating cities. These cities became a sanctuary for those affected by the changing tides, providing them with a thriving community despite the challenges they faced. But, not every story has a happy ending. In their first bad ending, Kay and Tinki's love fell apart, leaving them heartbroken and yearning for what once was. Their paths diverged, and their love, once so strong, became a faded memory.

Without hesitation, he decided to stop and enjoy a refreshing dip in the cool waters. Settling by the lake's edge, Bertie's sizable, scaly frame plopped into the water with a resounding splash. The lake, caught off guard by the intrusion, rippled and waved as the dragon settled into its depths. Unbeknownst to the innocent fish peacefully swimming nearby, the water was about to turn into Bedlam Bay with Bertie around. As the dragon reclined, savoring the feeling of the water enveloping his massive body, a sudden and thunderous sound erupted from beneath the lake's surface. An enormous fart, echoing in the silence of the idyllic surroundings, erupted from Bertie's nether regions. The rancid aroma wafted through the air, threatening to infiltrate the nostrils of any nearby creatures within a half-mile radius. The unsuspecting fish, caught in the midst of Bertie's epic flatulence, gagged and gasped for fresh air as their underwater world became a toxic cloud of stench. A few fainted and floated lazily to the surface, the smell proving too much for their delicate fishy sensibilities. Bertie glanced over and couldn't help but chuckle at the ensuing chaos he had accidentally created. Curiosity getting the better of him, Bertie dove beneath the surface, his gigantic wings creating a wave that splashed water onto the surrounding trees. With each gulp of air, the dragon inhaled the scent of his own fearsome emissions, finding it quite amusing. His rumbling laughter reverberated through the lake, causing cattails to quiver and tiny pebbles to dance on the lake's floor. Emboldened by the chaos, Bertie decided to join in the bizarre feast he had unwillingly prepared. Swirling his massive tail, he herded the dazed and confused fish towards the lake's edge. As their senses returned, the fish realized they were in the presence of a hungry dragon and swam for their lives to the shore. With a glint in his eye, Bertie scooped up fish after fish with his gleaming talons, delighted at the incremental redemption to his unintended water-induced crime. Crunching down on crunchy scales and tender flesh, he savored each bite, his laughter blending harmoniously with the hurried splashes of other fish finding safety in deeper waters. As the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in shades of pinks and purples, Bertie had his fill, his belly now happily distended. And just like that, the dragon decided it was time to bid his farewell to the lake, leaving a trail of bubbles behind him as he took off into the evening sky. The lake, recovering from its recent ordeal, sighed with relief as the noxious air dispersed, and harmony returned to its sparkling waters. The surviving fish vowed never to venture too close to the dragon's domain and to be wary of farting creatures in the future. And so, this comedic tale of Bertie, the flatulent dragon who turned a serene lake into a fishy feast and a haven of chaos, shall forever live on, whispered among the mystical creatures who roam the magical realm."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Glycolysis: The first step is the breakdown of glucose through glycolysis. In this process, glucose is converted into two molecules of pyruvate, with the release of energy and the production of a small amount of ATP and NADH. 2. Pyruvate Decarboxylation: The two molecules of pyruvate produced in glycolysis enter the mitochondria. Each pyruvate molecule is converted into Acetyl CoA through a process called pyruvate decarboxylation. During this step, an electron is extracted from each pyruvate, which is picked up by NAD+ to form NADH. 3. Krebs cycle (Citric Acid Cycle): The Acetyl CoA enters the citric acid cycle, also known as the Krebs cycle. Here, the Acetyl CoA undergoes a series of chemical reactions, resulting in the release of more energy, NADH, ATP, and FADH2 (another electron carrier molecule). 4. Electron Transport Chain (ETC): The high-energy electrons carried by NADH and FADH2 are transported through a series of protein complexes in the inner mitochondrial membrane in a process called the electron transport chain. This movement of electrons generates a flow of protons across the membrane, creating an electrochemical gradient. 5. Chemiosmosis: As protons flow back into the mitochondrial matrix through ATP synthase, the energy is used to generate ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi). This process is known as chemiosmosis. 6. Transfer of Electrons to G3P: The final step involves the transfer of electrons from the electron transport chain to G3P (glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate). G3P is an intermediate molecule in the Calvin cycle, which is a part of photosynthesis. The electrons are used to convert G3P into glucose, completing the cycle. In summary, the path of an electron from a molecule of water to G3P involves glycolysis, pyruvate decarboxylation, the Krebs cycle, the electron transport chain, chemiosmosis, and ultimately their transfer to G3P for glucose synthesis."},{"prompt":"describe the path of an electron from a molecule of water to g3p in photosynthesis","completion":"The path of an electron from a molecule of water to G3P in photosynthesis occurs during the light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle. Here is a step-by-step description: 1. Photosystem II: In the thylakoid membrane of the chloroplast, light energy is absorbed by pigments, primarily chlorophyll, in photosystem II. This excites an electron in the chlorophyll molecule, which is then captured by an electron acceptor. 2. Electron Transport Chain (ETC): The excited electron is passed through a series of electron carrier molecules in the thylakoid membrane, creating a flow of electrons through the chain. As a result, protons (H+) are pumped across the thylakoid membrane into the thylakoid space, creating an electrochemical gradient. 3. Photolysis of Water: To replace the lost electron, water molecules are split through a process called photolysis. This releases oxygen, electrons, and protons. One of the electrons replaces the excited electron in photosystem II, and the other is used later in the process. 4. Photosystem I: The electron from photosystem II is passed through a second electron transport chain in photosystem I. As it moves through the chain, it gains energy from light absorbed by photosystem I. 5. NADP+ Reduction: The electron is transferred to another electron carrier molecule, NADP+, which picks up the electron and an H+ ion to form NADPH. NADPH is an essential molecule for the Calvin cycle, the next stage of photosynthesis. 6. ATP Generation: As the electrons move through the electron transport chains of both photosystem II and photosystem I, the flow of protons back into the stroma through ATP synthase occurs. This generates ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi) through chemiosmosis. 7. Calvin Cycle (Carbon Fixation): The NADPH and ATP produced in the light-dependent reactions are utilized in the Calvin cycle. During this cycle, carbon dioxide is fixed by the enzyme RuBisCO, and G3P is formed as an intermediate. The electrons from NADPH are used to reduce G3P to form glucose. In summary, the path of an electron from a molecule of water to G3P in photosynthesis involves the light-dependent reactions, where water is split, and the electrons are transferred through photosystems and electron transport chains. These electrons are then used in the Calvin cycle to produce G3P and eventually glucose."},{"prompt":"what happens to the five other g3p molecules in photosynthesis","completion":"In photosynthesis, five out of the six G3P molecules generated in the Calvin cycle undergo a series of reactions to regenerate the starting molecule, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP). This process is known as the regeneration phase of the Calvin cycle. Here's what happens to the remaining G3P molecules: 1. Conversion to RuBP: Five out of the six G3P molecules formed in the Calvin cycle are used to regenerate RuBP. Each G3P molecule donates a phosphate group and undergoes a series of rearrangements and enzymatic reactions to form three molecules of RuBP. RuBP is a five-carbon molecule necessary for the continuation of the Calvin cycle. 2. Utilization of ATP: The regeneration of RuBP requires ATP (adenosine triphosphate) as an energy source. The ATP produced in the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis is utilized during this step to power the reactions that convert G3P to RuBP. 3. Continuation of the Calvin Cycle: Once the five G3P molecules have regenerated RuBP, the cycle can start again. RuBP combines with carbon dioxide in the presence of the enzyme RuBisCO, resulting in the formation of two molecules of G3P. One of these G3P molecules leaves the cycle to be used for various metabolic processes, such as the synthesis of glucose, while the other five G3P molecules continue through the regeneration phase. In summary, five out of the six G3P molecules produced in the Calvin cycle are used to regenerate the starting molecule, RuBP. This process requires ATP and goes through a series of reactions to convert G3P back into RuBP. The remaining one G3P molecule is utilized for glucose synthesis or other cellular processes."},{"prompt":"Make a detailed comedic story of a naked Ogre sitting in a lake and farting in it (describe how the Ogre's butt looks, describe how the water looks as the Ogre farts in it). the stench killing some of the fish, which the Ogre happily devours.","completion":"Once upon a time, in a faraway land, there lived a most peculiar creature - an ogre named Gargantua. Gargantua was known throughout the kingdom for his sheer size and brute strength, but also for his rather questionable hygiene habits. One fateful summer's day, while wandering through the forest, Gargantua stumbled upon a picturesque lake. Excited by the sight, his eyes sparkled with delight as he noticed the inviting transparent waters glimmering under the enchanting sunlight. Without hesitation, and never one for following customs, Gargantua decided to make himself comfortable and took a seat on a mossy rock by the lake's edge. Now, let's talk about the Ogre's bottom, which, as you can imagine, was not the sight for people with weak stomachs. It was a sight that could make grown men wince and ladies blush. Enormous cheeks, each resembling a mountain of flesh, rested upon the rock beside the water. The sheer enormity of Gargantua's posterior could rival that of a small hill - a hill that, surprisingly enough, was shockingly pale and covered in what seemed to be a dense layer of mossy hair. As Gargantua took his position, the true spectacle began. With each thudding sound, the lake water trembled. It was as if Mother Nature, in all her wisdom, decided to take this opportunity to toy with poor Gargantua. The water beneath him rippled and quivered, dancing to the symphony of his intestinal whims. As Gargantua unleashed his mighty flatulence, the water transformed entirely. Aerated bubbles rose to the surface as if performing an exquisite ballet, perfectly choreographed by none other than the Ogre himself. The once clear lake water transformed into a tumultuous sea of indescribable hues. Pastel greens, murky browns, and faint shades of yellow swirled together, creating a captivating masterpiece. The sight was so absurd, it could only be appreciated for its comedic value. However, as with any work of art, there were unintended consequences. The noxious odor that emanated from Gargantua's gas cloud wreaked havoc on the lake's inhabitants. Poor, unsuspecting fish, caught in the crossfire of the Ogre's gastronomical defiance, found themselves gasping for breath, their tiny gills unable to escape the wrathful stench. The usually lively and colorful fish could be seen floating belly-up on the water's surface, their eyes rolling back in a tragicomic fashion. Gargantua, being Gargantua, chose to interpret these consequences in his own unique way. He wriggled his mischievous eyebrows, his eyes glinting with mischief as he gleefully observed the aftermath of his formidable flatulence. With each gasping fish, Gargantua saw not tragedy but opportunity. And so, as the stench lingered in the air, he wasted no time in scooping up the lifeless fish, consuming them with a voracious appetite. And there you have it, a story of an ogre who, in his comical and unapologetically peculiar ways, managed to turn a serene lake into a vibrant, gassy canvas. A tale where even the foulest of odors could be seen as an invitation for gluttonous indulgence. Just remember, dear reader, that sometimes, even the most bizarre stories can unearth a chuckle or two."},{"prompt":"Pourriez-vous rephraser ci-dessous : J’ai commencé à cuisiner depuis l’âge de 12 ans.

Er ist wie ein im Stadtbusverkehr eingesetzter Stadtlinienbus aufgebaut, wird im Gegensatz zu diesem aber nicht von einem Verbrennungsmotor, sondern von einem oder mehreren Elektromotoren angetrieben. Seinen Fahrstrom bezieht er – ähnlich der Straßenbahn – mittels Stromabnehmern aus einer über der Fahrbahn gespannten Oberleitung, die jedoch stets zweipolig ausgeführt ist. Oberleitungsbusse sind somit spurgebunden, aber nicht spurgeführt. Die Bezeichnung Oberleitungsbus wird dabei sowohl für das Fahrzeug selbst als auch für die dazugehörige Infrastruktur verwendet.', 'Die ersten Anlagen wurden zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts eröffnet, weltweit existierten Ende des Jahres 2021 insgesamt 272 Oberleitungsbus-Betriebe in 47 Staaten. Sie sind überwiegend in Mittelosteuropa, den Nachfolgestaaten der Sowjetunion, der Volksrepublik China, Nordkorea, Italien und der Schweiz anzutreffen und werden in der Liste der Oberleitungsbussysteme aufgeführt. Über 500 Netze wurden wieder stillgelegt, eine Übersicht hierzu gibt die Liste der ehemaligen Oberleitungsbussysteme. Die meisten früheren Betriebe existierten in der westlichen Welt, wo der Oberleitungsbus in den 1950er und 1960er Jahren seine Blütezeit erlebte. In 30 Ländern, die früher Obusverkehr aufwiesen, ist das Verkehrsmittel mittlerweile gar nicht mehr anzutreffen.', 'Eine ausführliche Darstellung der historischen Entwicklung findet sich im Hauptartikel Geschichte des Oberleitungsbusses.', 'Definition und Rechtslage.', 'Der Oberleitungsbus ist eine Mischung aus Straßenbahn und Bus, das heißt, er kombiniert Elemente einer spurgebundenen Bahn mit denjenigen eines Kraftfahrzeugs. Dies macht sich auch juristisch bemerkbar – in den nationalen Rechtsgebungen werden Obusse zumeist als Eisenbahn behandelt, nicht zuletzt deshalb, weil nur in wenigen Staaten spezielle Verordnungen für Straßenbahnen bestehen. Während bei Omnibussen zwischen Linienbussen und solchen für den Gelegenheitsverkehr unterschieden wird, dienen Oberleitungsbusse ausschließlich dem Linienverkehr.', 'Weiter findet sich die rechtliche Einordnung als Eisenbahn zum Teil auch im Arbeitsrecht und im Arbeitnehmerschutz wieder. So sind beispielsweise die Mitarbeiter eines österreichischen Obus-Betriebs automatisch Mitglied im Eisenbahner-Kollektivvertrag. Ebenso erfolgt die technische Abnahme beziehungsweise Zulassung neuer Oberleitungsbusse häufig – analog zur Zulassung von Eisenbahnfahrzeugen – durch die entsprechende Eisenbahn-Fachaufsichtsbehörde, dem sogenannten Bahnamt. So zum Beispiel in Tschechien durch den \\"Drážní úřad\\" oder in Italien durch das \\"Ufficio speciale trasporti a impianti fissi\\", kurz USTIF. Generell ist die Zulassung eines Oberleitungsbusses aufwändiger und dauert deutlich länger als bei einem Omnibus. Für Osteuropa typisch waren früher außerdem gesonderte Tarife im Oberleitungsbusverkehr. Bis heute werden dort vielerorts – trotz gleichen Fahrpreises und gemeinsamer Betreibergesellschaft – getrennte Fahrscheine ausgegeben, die nicht wechselseitig verwendet werden können.', 'Kraftfahrzeugkennzeichen.', 'Die Spurgebundenheit analog zu einer Bahn macht sich mitunter auch äußerlich bemerkbar. So ist für Trolleybusse in 25 von 47 Staaten kein Kraftfahrzeugkennzeichen vorgeschrieben. Dies ist unter anderem in der Schweiz, wenn auch erst seit 1940, und den meisten ehemals sozialistisch regierten Ländern der Fall – nicht jedoch in Deutschland und Österreich. Ersatzweise muss die jeweilige Betriebsnummer deutlich erkennbar außen am Fahrzeug angeschrieben sein. Dies ist bei den meisten Verkehrsgesellschaften ohnehin Standard, unabhängig von der gesetzlichen Regelung bezüglich der Nummernschilder. Teilweise wird dabei die ungenutzte Kennzeichenhalterung zur Angabe der Fahrzeugnummer verwendet. In Österreich führen nach dem 1.u202fApril 2017 neu zugelassene Oberleitungsbusse ebenfalls das – an diesem Tag neu eingeführte – Kennzeichen für reine Elektrofahrzeuge, das heißt mit grüner statt schwarzer Schrift.', 'Auch in den nicht mehr existierenden Staaten Sowjetunion, Tschechoslowakei und Jugoslawien waren keine Kennzeichen vorgeschrieben, während sie beispielsweise in der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik verpflichtend waren.', 'Fahrerlaubnis.', 'Für das Führen eines Oberleitungsbusses muss zusätzlich zum regulären Omnibusführerschein und dem Personenbeförderungsschein eine innerbetriebliche Zusatzausbildung absolviert werden. Darin werden die betreffenden Berufskraftfahrer über die technische Beschaffenheit der Fahrzeuge und der elektrischen Anlagen sowie über die technischen Besonderheiten des Betriebes unterrichtet. Auch Sicherheitsbestimmungen, Signalkunde, Störungsbehebung und zusätzliche Fahrstunden sind Bestandteil der Fortbildung. Beim Betrieb im schwedischen Landskrona wird für die Extraschulung ein Zeitaufwand von mindestens acht Stunden veranschlagt, beim Trolleybus Schaffhausen sind es etwa zwanzig Stunden und in Esslingen am Neckar rund zwei Wochen. Größere Betriebe unterhalten eigens zu diesem Zweck spezielle Fahrschulwagen, auch Lehrwagen genannt. In Deutschland müssen Obusfahrer außerdem, wie Straßenbahnfahrer, nach erfolgter Schulung eine besondere Eignungsprüfung gemäß BOStrab ablegen. In Italien muss sowohl eine mündliche als auch eine praktische Prüfung absolviert werden.', 'Die Zusatzqualifikation wird beispielsweise in der Schweiz auch im Führerausweis eingetragen. Dort bescheinigt der Code 110 dem Inhaber, zum Führen von Trolleybussen berechtigt zu sein. Zuvor war sie als eigene Kategorie im Führerausweis eingetragen. In manchen Staaten gibt es diese eigene Kategorie bis heute. In Bulgarien lautet sie \\"T\\", in Estland \\"D-troll\\" für Solowagen bzw. \\"D-trollE\\" für Gelenkwagen, in Lettland \\"TROL\\", in Litauen \\"T\\", in Polen \\"105\\", in Rumänien \\"Tb\\" bzw. früher \\"H\\" und in Ungarn \\"TR\\". In Westdeutschland existierte früher zusätzlich zur regulären Führerscheinklasse 2 für Fahrzeuge über 7,5 Tonnen die Kategorie 2e bzw. 2E für Elektrofahrzeuge, darunter auch Obusse.', 'Der Erwerb des Führerscheins war dabei früher oft vereinfacht, um die Umschulung von Wagenführern des Schienenverkehrs zu erleichtern. In manchen Staaten ist bis heute kein Omnibus-Führerschein erforderlich, um einen Obus fahren zu dürfen. Als Basis für die innerbetriebliche Zusatzausbildung genügt ein Pkw-Führerschein. In der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik reichte sogar eine Fahrberechtigung für Elektrokarren aus. In der Volksrepublik China gibt es Fahrer, die nur eine Erlaubnis für Trolleybusse besitzen, sie dürfen keine Omnibusse lenken. Eine ähnliche Situation bestand früher auch in Westdeutschland. Dort durften Fahrer, die nur die oben genannte Führerscheinklasseu202f2E, aber nicht den sogenannten großen Führerschein der Klasseu202f2 zuzüglich Fahrerlaubnis für Kraftomnibusse hatten, zwar Obusse, aber weder Kraftomnibusse noch Lastkraftwagen oder Personenkraftwagen führen.', 'Abgrenzung zum Oberleitungslastkraftwagen.', 'Eng mit Oberleitungsbussen verwandt sind Oberleitungslastkraftwagen, die ausschließlich dem Güterverkehr dienen. Diese werden deshalb häufig auch \\"Güter-Obus\\" genannt, obwohl Obusse eigentlich Personenverkehrsmittel sind. Die Bezeichnung \\"Obus\\" basiert in diesem Fall auf der Gleichartigkeit ihres Antriebssystems. Unabhängig davon gab es in den Anfangsjahren des Systems auch einige wenige Obusanlagen, auf denen mit jeweils eigenen Fahrzeugen sowohl Güter- als auch Personenverkehr stattfand. Eine weitere diesbezügliche Besonderheit war der Oberleitungsbus Sankt Lambrecht in Österreich. Dort dienten – ähnlich einem Kombinationsbus – spezielle Fahrzeuge sowohl dem Gütertransport als auch der Personenbeförderung. Die veraltete Bezeichnung \\"gleislose Bahn\\" wurde dabei synonym sowohl für Oberleitungsbusse als auch für Oberleitungslastkraftwagen verwendet. In Russland und der Ukraine nutzen einige Betriebe Oberleitungslastkraftwagen als Arbeitswagen für Reparatur- und Wartungsarbeiten städtischer Obusnetze. In manchen Oberleitungsbusnetzen wurden auch Postsendungen befördert, meist wenn sie zuvor Postkutschen-Verbindungen ablösten.', 'Kennzeichnung von Haltestellen.', 'Typisch für Obuslinien ist die besondere Kennzeichnung der Haltestellen. Während dies in Mittel- und Osteuropa bis heute Standard ist, setzen die Verkehrsbetriebe in Westeuropa mittlerweile auf einheitliche Stationsbeschilderungen unabhängig vom Verkehrsmittel. Jedoch war dies nicht immer der Fall. So existierten in Deutschland und Österreich ab 1939 auch für Obusse einheitliche gelb-grüne Haltestellenzeichen. Hierbei verwendete man aber nicht die kreisrunden Straßenbahnschilder, sondern die eigentlich für Kraftfahrlinien vorgesehenen \\"Haltestellenfahnen\\" respektive \\"Haltestellenlöffel\\" in Form eines Signalflügels. Statt wie üblich mit dem Namen des Omnibusunternehmens war der Signalarm jedoch mit der Aufschrift \\"Obus\\" bzw. \\"OBUS\\" gekennzeichnet und etwas kürzer. In Hamburg und Hannover waren abweichend davon rechteckige, zweizeilige Tafeln mit der Aufschrift \\"Obus Haltestelle\\" bzw. \\"Obus-Haltestelle\\" in schwarzer Schrift auf weißem Grund anzutreffen. Ebenso in der Schweiz, dort jedoch mit der Aufschrift \\"Trolleybus Haltestelle\\". In Italien kennzeichnete man reine Obus-Haltestellen mit \\"FERMATA FILOBUS\\", gemischte Obus- und Autobus-Haltestellen hingegen neutral mit \\"FERMATA\\". Noch in den 1980er Jahren beschilderten ferner die Stadtwerke Solingen die Abfahrtsstellen ihrer Oberleitungsbusse auf dem zentralen Graf-Wilhelm-Platz als \\"Bahnsteig\\". Eine weitere Obus-typische Besonderheit gegenüber dem Omnibus ist es, die Haltestellenschilder direkt an den Querdrähten der Oberleitung anzubringen.', 'Kennzeichnung von Linien.', 'Mitunter werden bzw. wurden Obuslinien auch durch ein der Liniennummer vorangestelltes „O“ (Graz, Hamburg, Hannover, Linz, Minden, München und Berlin) oder ein vorangestelltes „T“ (Burgas, Mediaș, Piatra Neamț, Satu Mare, Sibiu und Ula: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"1.

Der von Meister Eckhart († 1327/1328) geprägte Ausdruck bezeichnet in einem übertragenen Sinn einen „Ort“ in der menschlichen Seele, an dem nach spirituellen Lehren Gott oder die Gottheit anwesend ist und eine Vereinigung der Gottheit mit der Seele zustande kommen kann.', 'Schon in der Antike trugen Philosophen und Theologen Thesen vor, die später zu Voraussetzungen und Bestandteilen der mittelalterlichen Lehren vom Seelengrund wurden. Auch die einschlägige mittelalterliche Terminologie geht auf Begriffe dieser Denker zurück. Antike stoische und neuplatonische Philosophen waren der Überzeugung, es gebe in der menschlichen Seele eine steuernde Instanz, die der göttlichen, das Weltall lenkenden Macht analog oder wesensgleich sei. Damit wurde die Möglichkeit einer Verbundenheit sterblicher und irrtumsanfälliger Menschen mit dem Bereich des Ewigen, Göttlichen und absolut Wahren begründet. Kirchenschriftsteller griffen philosophische Konzepte vom Verhältnis zwischen Gott und der Seele auf und formten sie in christlichem Sinne um. Der Kirchenvater Augustinus nahm an, es gebe in der Tiefe des menschlichen Geistes einen Bereich, das \\"abditum mentis\\", in dem ein verborgenes apriorisches Wissen liege.', 'Im 12. Jahrhundert wurden Konzepte entwickelt, nach denen im innersten Bereich der Seele eine Betrachtung Gottes möglich ist, doch erst im Spätmittelalter entstand eine ausgeformte Lehre von der Einheit der Seele mit der Gottheit im Seelengrund. Ihr Urheber war Meister Eckhart, der sich auf Augustinus berief, aber in erster Linie seine eigene unkonventionelle, für damalige Verhältnisse anstößige Lehre vom Göttlichen in der menschlichen Seele verkündete. Er behauptete, es gebe in der Seele ein Innerstes von göttlicher Qualität, das er „Grund“ nannte. Der Seelengrund gehöre nicht zur Schöpfung, sondern stehe über allem von Gott Geschaffenen. Er sei absolut einfach und frei von allen einschränkenden Bestimmungen und unterscheide sich nicht von der „Gottheit“, dem überpersönlichen Aspekt des Göttlichen. Alles Geschaffene sei nichtig und habe keinen Zugang zu Gott; im ungeschaffenen, überzeitlichen Seelengrund hingegen sei eine Gotteserfahrung möglich, denn dort sei die Gottheit immer präsent. Diese Erfahrung bezeichnete Eckhart als „Gottesgeburt“ im Seelengrund. Die Voraussetzung dafür sei „Abgeschiedenheit“: Die Seele müsse sich mit äußerster Konsequenz von allem lösen, was sie von der göttlichen Einfachheit und Undifferenziertheit in ihrem Innersten ablenke.', 'Eckharts Lehre vom Seelengrund wurde bald nach seinem Tod von der Kirche als häretisch verurteilt, doch fand ihr Gehalt teilweise in abgewandelter Form bei spätmittelalterlichen Gottessuchern Zustimmung. In der Moderne ist sie oft als Ausdruck eines mystischen Irrationalismus betrachtet worden. Neuere Philosophiehistoriker betonen jedoch, dass Eckhart keineswegs die Vernunft abwertete, sondern mit einer philosophischen Argumentation überzeugen wollte und den Seelengrund als Intellekt auffasste.', 'In der Frühen Neuzeit lebte das Konzept des Seelengrunds oder Seelenzentrums als Stätte der Gotteserfahrung in geistlicher Literatur fort. Es wurde sowohl von katholischen Autoren als auch im evangelischen Pietismus aufgegriffen. Eine andere Bedeutung gaben Denker der Aufklärung dem Ausdruck „Grund der Seele“. Sie bezeichneten damit den Ort einer „dunklen“ Erkenntnis, aus der die klare hervorgehe.', 'Vorgeschichte.', 'Antike.', 'In der Antike entwickelten pagane und christliche Autoren Seelenlehren, mit denen sie Elemente von Meister Eckharts Modell vorwegnahmen. Dabei ging es um einen als göttlich oder gottförmig betrachteten Teil der Seele oder um eine göttliche Instanz in ihr.', 'Frühe Ansätze.', 'Der Vorsokratiker Heraklit († um 460 v. Chr.) schrieb, man könne die Grenzen der Seele nicht ausfindig machen, auch wenn man jeden Weg beschreite; so tief sei ihr „Logos“. Heraklit betrachtete die Seele als einen repräsentativen Teil des kosmischen Feuers, der Macht, die nach seiner Lehre alle Dinge konstituiert und von der die Prozesse im Universum abhängen. Er bezeichnete die Seele auch als einen Funken von der Substanz der Sterne.', 'Platon († 348/347 v. Chr.) entwarf ein Modell der Seele, in dem er ihr eine dreiteilige, hierarchisch geordnete Struktur zuschrieb. Nach seiner Theorie wird der niedrigste der drei Seelenteile von den sinnlichen Begierden gesteuert und ist von leidenschaftlicher und unbesonnener Natur. Diesem Bereich in jeder Hinsicht entgegengesetzt ist der höchste Teil, die Sphäre der Vernunft. Der mittlere Teil, das „Muthafte“, steht zwischen der Vernunft und der Begierde; ihm fällt die Aufgabe zu, das von der Vernunft für richtig Befundene in die Tat umzusetzen. Da die Vernunft die Quelle der Weisheit ist, kommt ihr von Natur aus der höchste Rang zu. Diesem Seelenteil gebührt gemäß der natürlichen Ordnung die Herrschaft über die anderen Teile und den Körper, denn nur die Vernunft kann beurteilen, was dem Ganzen zuträglich ist, und ist dank dieser Einsicht zu richtiger Lenkung befähigt. Der vernünftige Seelenteil weist göttliche Eigenschaften auf. Er ist dem Göttlichen, Ewigen und Unveränderlichen verwandt, ähnlich oder gleichartig; wie dieses ist er ungeworden und unvergänglich. Sein Streben richtet sich auf Wissen. Das Ziel sind nicht nur Erkenntnisse, die mittels eines diskursiven Prozesses gewonnen werden; vielmehr geht es in erster Linie um ein besonderes Erfahrungswissen höchsten Ranges, das jeder nur für sich erstreben kann. Inwieweit solches Wissen tatsächlich konkret erreichbar ist, lässt Platon offen. Das Erfahrungswissen, das er meint, resultiert aus einer Art Schau, die intuitiven und religiösen Charakter hat und sich auf einen transzendenten, göttlichen Bereich bezieht. Der Gegenstand solcher Schau ist etwas, was nicht in Sprache und Begriff eingeht. Es ist „unsagbar“ \\"(árrhēton)\\", da sich eine solche Erfahrung weder begründen noch mitteilen lässt; sie ist nicht objektivierbar und kann nicht richtig oder falsch sein, sondern ist dem Subjekt nur entweder gegeben oder nicht.', 'Die stoische Seelenvorstellung.', 'Die Stoiker griffen herkömmliche Vorstellungen – darunter das platonische Modell – auf und wandelten sie ab. Sie hielten das Urfeuer für die göttliche Kraft, die aus sich das Weltall entfaltet und gestaltet habe und die es durchdringe, belebe, bewege und im Sein erhalte. Den Menschen betrachteten sie als „Mikrokosmos“, als „kleine Welt“, in der sich die Ordnung des „Makrokosmos“ widerspiegle. Dabei wiesen sie der menschlichen Seele die Rolle des belebenden Feuers im Mikrokosmos zu; sie sahen in ihr ein Ebenbild der Gottheit, die den Kosmos lenke. Daraus ergab sich die Metapher des „Seelenfunkens“; die individuelle Seele erschien als Funke (\\"apóspasma\\", abgerissener Teil) des göttlichen Urfeuers. Im Mittelpunkt der Seele nahmen die Stoiker eine leitende und koordinierende Instanz an, das \\"hēgemonikón\\", das sie meist im Herzen verorteten. Dieses Seelenzentrum setzt der stoischen Lehre zufolge die Teilfunktionen – insbesondere das Vorstellen, Denken und Wollen – nach einem einheitlichen Plan in Bewegung und ordnet sie auf ein Ziel, die Erhaltung des Ganzen, hin. Das \\"hegemonikon\\" im Herzen ist das Ordnungsprinzip – der Logos – des Menschen, so wie das Urfeuer, das seinen Sitz in der Sonne hat, im Kosmos die Rolle des ordnenden und strukturierenden Prinzips spielt. Der Logos im Menschen stimmt mit dem Weltlogos überein, die Natur des Makrokosmos und des Mikrokosmos ist ein und dieselbe.', 'Die Seelenlehre der griechischen Stoiker fand Eingang in die Welt der gebildeten Römer, die einschlägigen Begriffe wurden ins Lateinische übertragen und in die Terminologie der römischen philosophischen Literatur übernommen. Später gelangten die griechischen und lateinischen Ausdrücke in den Wortschatz der Kirchenväter. Das Wort \\"hegemonikon\\" wurde unterschiedlich übersetzt oder umschrieben: \\"principale cordis\\" („Hauptinstanz des Herzens“) bei Seneca, Hieronymus, Rufinus; \\"principatus\\" („leitendes Prinzip“, „Grundkraft“) bei Cicero; \\"regalis pars animi\\" („der königliche Teil des Geistes“) bei Apuleius. Der namhafte römische Stoiker Seneca († 65) meinte, die Seele des Weisen, der sich von nichts erschüttern lasse, verfüge über eine übermenschliche Kraft; eine göttliche Macht sei in ihn herabgestiegen. Der größere Teil dieser Seele sei dort geblieben, von wo der kleinere, herabgestiegene Teil gekommen sei. Der stoischen Tradition folgend verwendete Seneca das Bild des „Funkens“ \\"(scintilla)\\", um den göttlichen Ursprung des Geistprinzips im Menschen zu veranschaulichen: Es seien gewissermaßen Sternenfunken auf die Erde gefallen und an diesem himmelsfernen Ort verblieben. Der römische Kaiser Mark Aurel († 180), der sich ebenfalls zur stoischen Lehre bekannte und griechisch schrieb, behauptete, das \\"hegemonikon\\" sei unbezwingbar, „wenn es in sich selbst zurückgezogen mit sich selbst zufrieden ist“, denn es tue nichts, was es nicht wolle. Er verglich es mit einer Burg; wer dort seine Zuflucht suche, werde unbesiegbar.', 'Neuplatonische Seelenkonzepte.', 'Eine zentrale Rolle spielt das Konzept einer göttlichen Instanz in der Seele bei Plotin († 270), dem Begründer des Neuplatonismus. Nach seiner Lehre entstammt die unsterbliche Seele einer immateriellen, rein geistigen Welt, in der sie beheimatet ist und Glückseligkeit genießt. Sie hat aber die Möglichkeit, in die Körperwelt hinabzusteigen und sich dort zeitweilig mit einem Körper zu verbinden, den sie dann lenkt und als Werkzeug benutzt. So kommt irdisches Leben zustande. Allerdings bindet sich die Seele dabei nicht in ihrer Gesamtheit, sondern nur teilweise an den Körper. „Etwas von ihr“, ihr höchster „Teil“, verbleibt immer in der geistigen Welt.

Jahrhunderts die größte Talsperre Deutschlands.', 'Geographische Lage.', 'Der Oderteich liegt im Oberharz innerhalb des Nationalparks Harz im Ortsdreieck Braunlage-Sankt Andreasberg-Altenau. Sein Staudamm befindet sich 6,8 km nordwestlich der Kernstadt von Braunlage und 6 km nordnordöstlich vom Braunlager Ortsteil Sankt Andreasberg. Der Stauteich liegt zwischen der Achtermannshöhe (ca. ) im Ostsüdosten, dem Sonnenberg () im Südsüdwesten und dem Bruchberg (ca. ) im Westnordwesten.', 'Gespeist wird der Oderteich von der von Osten heran fließenden Oder und der unweit davon von Nordnordwesten kommenden \\"Rotenbeek\\"; etwa 350 Bachmeter oberhalb der Einmündung nimmt die Rotenbeek von Westnordwesten den kleinen Bach \\"Sonnenkappe\\" auf. Der Stauteich ist länglich von der Rotenbeek im Norden bis zum Staudamm im Süden gestreckt. Es gibt keine Ortschaften am Teich; aber in seinem Einzugsgebiet liegt 1,2 km östlich vom Stauraum der kleine Braunlager Ortsteil Oderbrück.', 'Über den Staudamm führt die Bundesstraße 242, die etwa 800 m südöstlich in die Bundesstraße 4 mündet. Etwa 12 km südlich liegt oderabwärts die 1934 fertiggestellte größere Odertalsperre.', 'Zweck.', 'Der Oderteich wurde errichtet, um über den Rehberger Graben die Wasserräder der Sankt Andreasberger Bergwerke auch in Trockenzeiten zuverlässig mit Aufschlagwasser zu versorgen. Sein Fassungsvermögen reichte aus, um eine Trockenperiode von etwa drei Monaten zu überbrücken. Er ist der größte aller Oberharzer Teiche.', 'Heute treibt das Wasser des Oderteiches noch mehrere Wasserkraftwerke in Sankt Andreasberg, in der Grube Samson und im Sperrluttertal an.', 'Geschichte.', 'Im Jahre 1703 wurde der \\"Neue Rehberger Graben\\" fertiggestellt, der Oderwasser nach Sankt Andreasberg leitete. Dies verbesserte deutlich die Aufschlagwasserversorgung der dortigen Bergwerke, doch konnte die Oder nach längerer Trockenheit nicht genügend Wasser liefern. Dies löste Überlegungen aus, die Kraftwasserversorgung durch die Anlage eines Wasserspeichers weiter zu verbessern.', 'Zehn bis 15 Kilometer weiter westlich, im Raum Clausthal-Zellerfeld und Hahnenklee waren zu diesem Zeitpunkt 50 bis 60 kleine Talsperrenbauwerke in Betrieb. Der dortige Baustil ließ sich aber nicht kopieren, da die für die Dichtung des Bauwerkes verwendeten Rasensoden in der Umgebung des Oderteiches nicht zur Verfügung standen.', 'Zwischenzeitlich war man dabei, den nur mit Holzgefludern angelegten Rehberger Graben zu „mauern“, das heißt, die Gefluder durch einen aus Erdbaustoffen und Trockenmauerwerk hergestellten, wesentlich beständigeren Kunstgraben zu ersetzen. Dabei stellte man fest, dass gründlich festgestampfter Granitgrus eine wirksame Dichtung bildet.', 'Der Vizebergmeister \\"Caspar Dannenberger\\" schrieb 1712 zwei Briefe an das Bergamt Clausthal und schlug vor, den Oderteichdamm aus Granitmauerwerk mit einer Granitgrus-Dichtung zu errichten. Dieser Vorschlag wurde umgesetzt. \\"Dannenberger\\", der geistige Vater des Oderteichdammes, erlebte die Umsetzung nicht mehr; er starb am 23. April 1713.', 'Im August 1714 war die Planung des Projektes beendet. Der Markscheider \\"Bernhard Ripking\\" hatte die erste Bauzeichnung erstellt, nach der \\"Andreas Leopold Hartzig\\" (1685–1761) einen Kostenvoranschlag verfasste. Bereits am 14. September genehmigte König Georg Ludwig durch einen \\"allergnädigsten Spezialbefehl\\" den Bau des Oderteichdammes und stellte die veranschlagten Mittel in Höhe von „3048 Thalern 27 gl“ bereit.', 'Im Frühjahr 1715 begann der Bau. Zunächst wurde ein Gründungsgraben ausgehoben, an dem die Dammdichtung angeschlossen wurde. In kleinen Steinbrüchen im künftigen Stauraum wurden die für das wasser- und luftseitige Mauerwerk erforderlichen Granitsteine und der Granitsand gewonnen. Dadurch konnte der künftige Beckeninhalt zugleich etwas vergrößert werden.', 'Die Arbeiten zogen sich bis 1722 hin. Da Hochwässer während der Bauzeit weder aufgestaut noch über den – relativ klein dimensionierten – Grundablass abgeleitet werden konnten, musste man ständig eine Hochwasserentlastungsanlage (Ausflut) vorhalten, die mit dem Staudamm mitwuchs.', 'Kurz nach Baubeginn wurde erstmals thematisiert, den Damm höher als ursprünglich geplant auszuführen. Letztendlich wurde im Jahr 1717 nach längerer Diskussion genehmigt, den Damm anstelle von sieben geplanten auf insgesamt neun Lachter (knapp 18 Meter) Höhe aufzuschütten. Dadurch vergrößerte sich das Dammschüttvolumen um 55 % und das Stauvolumen verdoppelte sich auf 1,67 Millionen Kubikmeter.', 'Durch die Erhöhung und andere Einflüsse erhöhten sich die Baukosten während der Ausführungszeit erheblich: Letztendlich kostete der Oderteichdamm rund 11.700 Reichstaler, fast das Vierfache der ursprünglich veranschlagten und genehmigten Summe. Das mehrfache Beantragen und Genehmigen der Nachträge wurde aber vom König nicht beanstandet. Die drei verantwortlichen Bergmeister und Grabensteiger wurden 1724 mit Geldprämien zwischen 12 und 100 Talern ausgezeichnet.', 'Der Sankt Andreasberger Bergbau kam im Jahre 1913 zum Erliegen. Fortan nutzte man die Anlagen des Oberharzer Wasserregals zur Stromerzeugung: Das Wasser des Oderteiches fließt weiterhin nach Sankt Andreasberg und wird dort in mehreren Kraftwerken, vor allem in der Grube Samson genutzt. Dies gewährleistet bis heute den wirtschaftlichen Betrieb von Oderteich und Rehberger Graben. Zu den Gefällepächtern gehören heute unter anderem die Unternehmen Harz Energie und Eckold.', 'Ende der 1920er Jahre planten die Harzwasserwerke eine deutliche Erhöhung des Oderteichdammes. Dabei wurden der Damm und die Geologie der Umgebung gründlich untersucht. Durch Schürfe wurde auch die Dichtung aus Granitgrus freigelegt und man stellte fest, dass diese aufgrund ihrer hohen Festigkeit kaum mit der Kreuzhacke zu bearbeiten war. Diese Planungen wurden später aus unbekannten Gründen nicht weiter verfolgt.', 'Konstruktion.', 'Der Staudamm des Oderteiches unterscheidet sich erheblich von den sonstigen Staubauwerken des Oberharzer Wasserregals. Das Dammbauwerk ist deutlich höher und das Stauvolumen erreicht knapp das Dreifache der Kubatur der größten Teiche um Clausthal-Zellerfeld und Hahnenklee. Außerdem wurden andere Baustoffe eingesetzt.', 'Staubauwerk.', 'Die Talsperre wurde von 1715 bis 1722 errichtet. Sie ist 17,3 Meter über der Gewässersohle und 22 m über der Gründungssohle hoch; vom luftseitigen Dammfuß aus gemessen beträgt die Höhe 19 Meter. Die Krone liegt auf Höhe. Das Bauwerk hat unterschiedlichen Angaben zufolge 36.500 bis 42.000 m³ Volumen. Es ist an der Krone 153 m lang und 16,1 m breit; der Fuß hat 34,6 m Basisbreite.', 'In der Dammmitte befindet sich mit bis zu 11,5 Meter Mächtigkeit die Dammdichtung aus festgestampften Granitgrus. Links und rechts davon wurde normales Dammschüttmaterial eingebracht. Die luft- und wasserseitigen Böschungen bestehen aus einem Zyklopenmauerwerk aus großen Granitsteinen und einer luft- und wasserseitigen Böschungsneigung von 1:0,625.', 'Die Talsperre erweist sich als ein sehr dauerhaftes Bauwerk und befindet sich wie die gesamte Stauanlage praktisch noch im Originalzustand. Grundsätzlich ist es nicht ganz klar, ob es sich beim Oderteichstaubauwerk um einen Staudamm oder um eine Staumauer handelt – wohl eine Kombination von beiden.', 'Grundablass (Striegel).', 'Die Absicht, für den Oderteich besonders beständiges Material zu verwenden, zeigt sich am besten an der Striegelanlage. An der taltiefsten Stelle wurde in den Damm ein Schacht mit einem Querschnitt von etwa 1,10 × 1,20 Metern eingebaut. Dieser Schacht ist mit großen behauenen Granitsteinen eingefasst und reicht bis zur natürlichen Talsohle. Von der Schachtsohle aus führt ein einlaufendes Gerinne von 0,75 Meter Breite und 0,90 Meter Höhe in den Stauraum. Dadurch kommuniziert der Stauraum des Teiches stets mit dem Wasserstand im Schacht. Von der Schachtsohle aus führen zwei Holzgerenne aus Eichenholz mit quadratischen Querschnitten von etwa 25 × 25 Zentimetern zum luftseitigen Dammfuß. Sie haben an der Schachtsohle einen Einlauf von oben, der ähnlich wie mit einem Badewannenstöpsel durch einen \\"Striegelzapfen\\" verschlossen wird. Über ein Gestänge kann dieser Zapfen vom \\"Striegelhaus\\" über dem Schacht aus gezogen oder abgesenkt werden. Das Eichengerenne ist so eingebaut, dass es auch bei geschlossenem Grundablass stets unter Wasser ist und damit kaum verrottet. Die gesamte Grundablasskonstruktion wird \\"Striegel\\" genannt.', '2016 wurde festgestellt, dass beide Holzgerenne schadhaft sind. Sie wiesen größere Fehlstellen auf; das Wasser hatte sich durch das umgebende Dichtungsmaterial Hohlräume geschaffen, wodurch es in großen Mengen den Weg aus dem Striegelschacht am Verschlussorgan vorbei in die Gerenne fand. In beide Gerenne wurde daher jeweils ein Kunststoffrohr eingeschoben, der verbleibende Zwischenraum sowie die Hohlräume mit einem Tonmehl-Zementgemisch verpresst. Das originale Holzgerenne verblieb damit an seiner Stelle; auch der Striegel als Verschlussorgan erfüllt weiterhin seine ursprüngliche Funktion.', 'Die Große Ausflut.', 'Jede Talsperre benötigt eine Hochwasserentlastungsanlage, damit auch außergewöhnlich große Hochwässer nicht zum Überströmen der Dammkrone führen.

Die gemäßigten Zonen werden für gewöhnlich nur auf dem Zug und in den Winterquartieren erreicht.', 'Historisch wurden die Seetaucher mit den Lappentauchern als \\"Taucher\\" zusammengefasst, sind mit diesen jedoch tatsächlich nicht näher verwandt.', 'Äußere Merkmale.', 'Seetaucher sind große Schwimm- und Tauchvögel mit einer Körperlänge von 53 bis 91 Zentimetern und einer Flügelspannweite zwischen 106 und 152 Zentimetern. Ihr Gewicht liegt zwischen 1 und 6,4 Kilogramm; die großen Arten sind damit erheblich schwerer als Gänse. Von den Lappentauchern unterscheiden sie sich vor allem durch vollständige Schwimmhäute, welche die drei nach vorn gerichteten Zehen des anisodactylen Fußes verbinden, sowie durch einen auch äußerlich gut sichtbaren, wenn auch nur kurzen Schwanz.', 'Seetaucher haben einen stromlinienförmigen Körper, der exzellent an das Wasserleben angepasst ist. Die Beine setzen weit hinten am Körper an und tragen kräftige Füße, was den Antrieb im und unter Wasser perfektioniert.', 'Ihr Gefieder ist im Brutkleid bei den meisten Arten auf der Oberseite schachbrettartig schwarz-weiß gefärbt, nur beim Sterntaucher ist es einfarbig graubraun. Auf der Unterseite ist es bei allen Arten fast weiß. Es ist sehr dicht und isoliert gut gegen die Kälte der arktischen und subarktischen Gewässer. Kopf und Hals sind bei allen Arten sehr farbenprächtig. Im Winter wird das auffällige Prachtkleid durch ein schlichteres Ruhekleid ersetzt. Männchen sind etwas größer und schwerer als Weibchen; ein sichtbarer Geschlechtsdimorphismus besteht ansonsten nicht. Junge Seetaucher ähneln ganzjährig adulten Vögeln im Ruhekleid; erst im Alter von etwa drei Jahren zeigen sie das typische Prachtkleid der Altvögel.', 'Stimme.', 'Der charakteristische „Gesang“ der Seetaucher ist ein extrem lautes und melodisches Heulen, das weit trägt und zu den lautesten Rufen gehört, die in den arktischen Breiten zu hören sind. Dieser Gesang wird nur zur Brutzeit geäußert und dient der Revierabgrenzung. Beim Sterntaucher rufen beide Partner, bei den anderen Arten nur die Männchen.', 'Ein anderer Ruf ist ein Warnruf, der bei Gefahr ausgestoßen wird. Bei Stern-, Pracht- und Pazifiktaucher ist dieser ein rabenartiges Krächzen, bei Eistaucher und Gelbschnabeltaucher ein „kreischendes Lachen“.', 'Verbreitung und Lebensraum.', 'Seetaucher bewohnen im Wesentlichen den Norden der Holarktis, also die Tundra und Taiga in Kanada, Alaska, Grönland, Skandinavien und Russland. Mit dem Sterntaucher und dem Prachttaucher brüten zwei der fünf Arten auch in Nordeuropa; die Südgrenze der Vorkommen beider Arten liegt in Europa im Norden Irlands, im nördlichen Schottland sowie im Süden von Norwegen und Schweden. Der Eistaucher brütet vor allem in Nordamerika, daneben auch in Grönland und auf Island; der Gelbschnabeltaucher bewohnt den Nordosten Sibiriens und den äußersten Norden Amerikas.', 'Seetaucher verbringen ihr ganzes Leben auf dem Wasser oder in dessen unmittelbarer Nähe. Die Brutplätze befinden sich bei den großen Arten an tiefen Seen der Tundren und borealen Zonen, beim Sterntaucher auch an kleinen Seen und Teichen. Wenn die Möglichkeit besteht, werden als Nistplätze kleine Inseln innerhalb der Seen bevorzugt. Sterntaucher und Gelbschnabeltaucher brüten in seltenen Fällen auch an geschützten Meeresbuchten oder in Flussdeltas.', 'Die Winterquartiere liegen je nach Art an den Küsten Europas, Asiens und Nordamerikas; in Europa umfassen sie unter anderem Nord- und Ostsee sowie das nördliche Mittelmeer, in Nordamerika reichen sie südwärts bis Niederkalifornien und Florida, in Asien die chinesische Küste hinunter bis Hainan.', 'Die grönländischen und isländischen Populationen des Eistauchers sind im Winter an europäischen Küsten zu beobachten und nur ausnahmsweise auf großen Seen im Binnenland. Häufiger sind aber Stern- und Prachttaucher, die im Winter in großer Zahl an mitteleuropäische Küsten kommen. Vor allem auf dem Herbstzug rasten beide Arten einzeln oder in kleinen Trupps auch tief im mitteleuropäischen Binnenland, meist auf großen Seen. Vor allem die nordsibirischen Populationen des Prachttauchers weisen dabei ein besonders interessantes Zugverhalten auf. Im Herbst wandern sie zum Schwarzen Meer, im Frühling führt ihr Zugweg sie zunächst zur Ostsee und von dort aus zum Weißen Meer. Ein solches Zugverhalten, bei dem Vögel auf anderem Weg als im Herbst ins Brutgebiet zurückkehren, wird als Schleifenzug bezeichnet und ist bisher nur für wenige Vogelarten belegt.', 'Der Gelbschnabeltaucher ist in Mitteleuropa Irrgast, der Pazifiktaucher wurde bisher nicht nachgewiesen.', 'Lebensweise.', 'Fortbewegung.', 'Seetaucher sind ausgezeichnete Taucher, die bis zu 75 Meter tief tauchen und bis zu acht Minuten unter Wasser bleiben können. Meist beträgt die Tauchtiefe aber nur zwei bis zehn Meter, und nur selten wird eine Tauchdauer von einer Minute überschritten. Seetaucher beginnen einen Tauchvorgang durch gerades Abtauchen, ohne wie manche andere Wasservögel (z. B. Lappentaucher) einen vorwärts gerichteten Sprung zu vollführen. Unter Wasser nutzen sie die Füße als Antrieb; die Flügel werden nur selten zur Hilfe genommen.', 'Auf dem Land bewegen sich Seetaucher dagegen sehr unbeholfen fort. Sie können nicht für längere Zeit aufrecht stehen, sondern müssen sich hierbei mit der Brust abstützen. Die Beine ermöglichen keine watschelnde Bewegung; stattdessen vollführen sie kurze, froschartige Sprünge, die kraftraubend sind und nur das Zurücklegen geringer Entfernungen ermöglichen.', 'Trotz der relativ kurzen Flügel sind Seetaucher gute Flieger und können große Distanzen zurücklegen. Ihr Flugbild ist durch einen gestreckten Hals gekennzeichnet, bei dem der Kopf etwas tiefer als der Körper gehalten wird; die Füße ragen nach hinten über den Schwanz hinaus. Fast immer heben Seetaucher von der Wasseroberfläche ab und landen auf dieser. Für den Start benötigen sie einen langen Anlauf. Lediglich der relativ kleine Sterntaucher ist in der Lage, von festem Land aufzufliegen.', 'Ernährung.', 'Ganz überwiegend fressen Seetaucher kleine oder mittelgroße Fische, die sie auf Tauchgängen erbeuten und meistens noch unter Wasser schlucken. Für gewöhnlich stellt weitere Nahrung nur seltene Beikost dar; dies können Frösche, Krebstiere, Weichtiere, Würmer oder Wasserinsekten sein. Es gibt jedoch Fälle, in denen Seetaucher an fischfreien Seen brüten und dann zeitweise ihre Ernährung ganz auf Weichtiere oder Insekten umstellen.', 'Seetaucher haben eine sehr dehnbare Speiseröhre, die ihnen das Schlucken relativ großer Beute ermöglicht. Eistaucher können bis 45 Zentimeter große und ein Kilogramm schwere Forellen oder sogar Flundern schlucken. Das Schlucken großer Beutetiere kann in sehr seltenen Fällen misslingen; so hat man schon Seetaucher gefunden, die an (zu) großen Fischen erstickt sind.', 'Fortpflanzung.', 'Seetaucher leben in Monogamie. Die Paare suchen alljährlich zur Brutzeit die Reviere des Vorjahres auf und bleiben auch während des Zuges und in den Winterquartieren zusammen. Seetaucher brüten nicht in jedem Jahr; etwa in jedem vierten Jahr setzen die Paare mit der Brut aus. Ein komplexes Balzritual gibt es bei Seetauchern nicht. Bei Paaren, die sich neu finden, kommt es zu einer Reihe synchroner Bewegungen auf dem Wasser, bei älteren Paaren sind selbst diese wenigen ritualisierten Verhaltensweisen noch eingeschränkter.', 'Die Begattung findet am Ufer statt. Oft wird mit der Paarung gleich nach der Ankunft in den Brutrevieren begonnen, und dies setzt sich über die nächsten Tage fort. Findet sie immer wieder an derselben Stelle statt, kann hierdurch eine Mulde im Boden entstehen, die dann später oft als Nest genutzt wird. Das Nest wird aus Wasserpflanzen und Moosen errichtet. Immer befindet es sich in unmittelbarer Ufernähe, fast nie weiter als einen Meter vom Wasser entfernt.', 'Im Revierverhalten unterscheidet sich der Sterntaucher von den größeren Arten. Letztere sind territorial und verteidigen das Revier aggressiv gegen alle Eindringlinge. Dagegen liegen die Nester der Sterntaucher oft dicht beieinander, und nur die unmittelbare Umgebung des Nestes wird verteidigt. Meistens reichen Drohgebärden aus, um einen Eindringling zu vertreiben. Selten kommt es zu einem Kampf, der dann aber äußerst heftig geführt wird und mit dem Tod eines Kontrahenten durch Ertränken oder Schnabelhiebe enden kann.', 'Es werden ein bis drei, in den meisten Fällen zwei Eier gelegt. Beide Eltern brüten. Nach dem Schlüpfen verbleiben die Jungen etwa drei Tage im Nest, ehe sie ins Wasser gehen. Sie sind in diesem jungen Alter bereits schwimm- und tauchfähig; oft ruhen sie auch auf dem Rücken der Eltern. Bis ins Alter von sieben Wochen und manchmal darüber hinaus werden die Jungen von den Altvögeln gefüttert. Einer der Jungvögel erweist sich meistens früh als der stärkere und ergattert die meiste Nahrung für sich. Wenn kein reichliches Nahrungsangebot vorhanden ist, hat dies oft den Tod des schwächeren Jungen zur Folge.', 'Die Kenntnisse zur Lebenserwartung der einzelnen Arten sind bisher unbefriedigend. Stern- und Prachttaucher werden älter als zehn und manchmal sogar älter als zwanzig Jahre. Bei einem Prachttaucher wurde ein Alter von 28 Jahren nachgewiesen. Hingegen ist beim Eistaucher bisher kein Exemplar bekannt geworden, das ein Lebensalter von mehr als acht Jahren erreicht hätte. Dies ist aber sicher nicht das tatsächliche maximale Alter.', 'Fressfeinde.', 'Ausgewachsene Seetaucher haben wenige Fressfeinde; lediglich große Greifvögel wie Seeadler können gelegentlich einen Seetaucher erbeuten. Seetaucher sind durchaus wehrhaft durch ihre dolchartigen Schnäbel: Im Jahr 2020 wurde ein Fall bekannt, bei dem ein Seetaucher einen Seeadler – der eines seiner Küken gerissen hatte – mit einem Stich ins Herz tötete.

Sie befindet sich im Südosten des Freistaates Sachsen, unweit der Grenzen zu Tschechien und Polen. Die Gemeinde entstand 1999 durch die Fusion der Orte Oberoderwitz und Niederoderwitz, die seine Ortsteile bilden. In der historischen Dreiteilung des Ortes unterschied man auch Mitteloderwitz. Mit knapp 5000 Einwohnern ist Oderwitz eine der größeren nichtstädtischen Gemeinden des Landkreises.', 'Oderwitz geht auf eine slawische Siedlung namens \\"Wudrijecz\\" zurück und wurde urkundlich erstmals 1324 als \\"Odrowitz\\" erwähnt. Bis ins 18. Jahrhundert war die Gemeinde durch Landwirtschaft und die grundherrschaftliche Trennung in sieben Anteile geprägt. Im 19. Jahrhundert entwickelte sich der Ort mit vielen Webereien zu einer Industriegemeinde. Ab 1960 erlebte die Gemeinde ihre wirtschaftliche Blütezeit, es wurden große Mengen Damastwaren produziert und exportiert. Nach der Wiedervereinigung verlor Oderwitz seine Bedeutung als Textilzentrum.', 'In neuerer Zeit wurde der Ort durch seine drei Bockwindmühlen und das Meteorologiezentrum \\"Wetterkabinett „Zittauer Gebirge“\\" als \\"Windmühlen- und Wetterdorf\\" bekannt. Ein weiteres touristisches Ziel ist die Sommerrodelbahn am Hang des Oderwitzer Spitzberges.', 'Geographie.', 'Geographische Lage und Ausdehnung.', 'Die Gemeinde Oderwitz liegt im südlichen Teil des Landkreises Görlitz, etwa neun Kilometer nordwestlich von Zittau und fünfzehn Kilometer südlich von Löbau im Oberlausitzer Bergland, dem Vorland des Zittauer Gebirges. Der Ort erstreckt sich über eine Länge von neun Kilometern und folgt dem Lauf des Flüsschens Landwasser. Zahlreiche kleine Bäche und Rinnsale durchziehen die Oderwitzer Flur. Die ursprüngliche Bewaldung ist durch die Schaffung von Acker- und Siedlungsflächen fast völlig verschwunden, nur das Königsholz im Osten blieb als größeres zusammenhängendes Waldgebiet erhalten.', 'Das Oderwitzer Tal liegt auf einer Höhe von etwa 300 Metern, wobei der Ortsteil Oberoderwitz etwas höher liegt als Niederoderwitz. Den höchsten Punkt der Gemeinde bildet mit 510 Metern Seehöhe der westlich gelegene Oberoderwitzer Spitzberg, der eine der markantesten Erhebungen des Umlandes ist. Weitere wichtige Erhebungen sind der Stumpfeberg im Westen, der Hutberg und der Sonnenhübel im Osten. Oderwitz liegt auf dem Grund des Oderwitzer Beckens.', 'Ortsgliederung.', 'Ursprünglich bestand Oderwitz aus den beiden Ortschaften Ober- und Niederoderwitz, die sich durch die grundherrschaftliche Trennung aus mehreren Anteilen zusammensetzten. So gab es noch im 19. Jahrhundert in Oberoderwitz den Ruppersdorfer, den Hainewalder und den Zittauer Anteil, in Niederoderwitz den Hainewalder, den Zittauer und der Zieglerschen Anteil, sowie Mitteloderwitz, das bis 1839 ein Anteil von Niederoderwitz war. Im Jahr 1910 wurde Mitteloderwitz wieder nach Niederoderwitz eingemeindet.', 'Nach der Fusion von Oberoderwitz und Niederoderwitz am 1. Januar 1999 gibt es nur noch eine Gemeinde Oderwitz, die beiden ehemaligen Gemeinden sind Ortsteile. Aus der Geschichte des Ortes sind viele Namen der alten Bauerngüter bekannt, die aber verwaltungstechnisch keine Bedeutung haben. Solche Güter sind zum Beispiel \\"Kleinpolen\\", \\"Viehbig\\" und \\"Rothes Gut\\" in Oberoderwitz, \\"Kreischerhof\\" und \\"Dreihäuser\\" in Mitteloderwitz sowie \\"Neufelden\\", \\"Viehwegshäuser\\" und \\"Landberghäuser\\" in Niederoderwitz.', 'Die letzten statistischen Daten auf der Ebene der Gemeindeteile wurden am 31. Dezember 1998 erhoben:', 'Nachbargemeinden.', 'Fünf Gemeinden grenzen an das Gemeindegebiet von Oderwitz. Dies sind Kottmar im Nordwesten, Herrnhut im Norden, Mittelherwigsdorf im Osten und Südosten, Hainewalde im Süden und Leutersdorf im Südwesten.', 'Geologie.', 'Bei den vulkanischen Aktivitäten im Übergang vom Alt- zum Jungtertiär wurde immer wieder zähflüssige Lava an die Erdoberfläche gedrückt. Diese erstarrte größtenteils zu Phonolith, aber auch zu Basalt und Nephelinbasanit. Letzteres tritt hauptsächlich im Norden von Oderwitz, am Unterlauf des Landwassers, sowie am Hut- und Pferdeberg zu Tage. Der Phonolith dagegen bildet neben den Kuppen von Spitzberg und Sonnenhübel auch den Hauptanteil des Deckengebirges dieser Gegend.', 'Im Pleistozän lagerten sich entlang des Landwassers und seiner Zuflüsse hauptsächlich trockene Kiese und Sande ab, die von einer Schicht aus Lösslehm und sandigen Tonen überdeckt wurden. Diese Deckschicht ist im Westen von Oderwitz recht mächtig, im Osten sind dagegen sandige Böden vorherrschend. Dies zeigt sich an mehreren Sand- und Kiesgruben östlich des Ortes. Die fruchtbarsten Böden befinden sich um Mitteloderwitz und am Spitzberg; sie entstanden durch die Verwitterung des Phonolithgesteins. Trotzdem ist der Boden in der hügeligen Gegend um Oderwitz im Allgemeinen nicht so ergiebig wie etwa im Zittauer Becken.', 'Neben Torf im Königsholz kommt unter Oderwitz lignitische Braunkohle vor, die allerdings von zahlreichen Störungen durchzogen ist. Daher kam die Förderung der Kohle über Abbauversuche am Kreischerhof und an der Oberoderwitzer Kirche nicht hinaus.', 'Klima.', 'Oderwitz liegt in der gemäßigten Klimazone, genauer in der feuchtkontinentalen Zone. Typisch sind kühl-feuchte Frühjahre und Sommer, ein langer warmer Herbst und ein Winter mit sehr häufigen, aber eher kurzen Schneeperioden.', 'Die durchschnittliche Jahrestemperatur beträgt 8,4 °C, die mittlere Jahresniederschlagsmenge 763,1 mm. Die wärmsten Monate sind Juli und August mit durchschnittlich 17,6 und 17,5 °C und die kältesten Januar und Februar mit −0,7 und 0 °C im Mittel. Der meiste Niederschlag fällt im August mit durchschnittlich 86 mm, der geringste im Februar und Oktober mit je 47 mm.', 'In seiner Geschichte war Oderwitz immer wieder von Starkniederschlägen im Ort selbst, aber vor allem an dem umgebenden Berghängen betroffen, die zu Überschwemmungen führten. Die letzte dieser Art ereignete sich am 9. Juni 2013, bei dem der Pegel des Landwassers von wenigen Zentimetern auf über zwei Meter anstieg.', 'Geschichte.', 'Frühe Geschichte bis ins 14. Jahrhundert.', 'Wann genau und von wem Oderwitz gegründet wurde, ist nicht bekannt, allerdings deutet der ursprüngliche Name des Ortes, \\"Wudrijecz\\", auf slawischen Ursprung hin. Es ist auch unklar, ob Oderwitz zur Zeit der Völkerwanderung, im 6. Jahrhundert, entstand, als slawische Volksstämme das Gebiet besiedelten, wo Jahrhunderte zuvor Sueben gelebt hatten. Man nimmt an, dass der slawische Stamm der Milzener – die Vorfahren der heutigen Sorben – nur in der nördlichen und mittleren Lausitz siedelte. Das Oderwitzer Tal dürfte dagegen im ersten Jahrtausend nur spärlich besiedelt gewesen sein, so wie der Rest der gebirgigen südlichen Oberlausitz. Man weiß jedoch, dass die Ortslage von Oderwitz zum Gebiet Zagost gehörte.', 'Über mehrere Jahrhunderte blieben die sorbischen Siedlungen in der nördlichen Lausitz bestehen, bis die Bewohner von den Markgrafen von Meißen unterworfen und christianisiert wurden. Allerdings beharrten die Sorben auf ihrer ursprünglichen Religion und verjagten die christlichen Priester. Daher fiel Kaiser Heinrich II. 1015 erneut in das Land ein und zwang die Sorben gewaltsam, sich zum Christentum zu bekennen. Viele flüchteten in die Heidegegenden und die Wälder der Region Zagost. Der Sage nach entstanden neben Oderwitz die Dörfer Eibau und Hörnitz sowie die böhmischen Städte Kreibitz und Windisch-Kamnitz.', 'Da sie dort ihrer Religion ungestört nachgehen konnten, ließ sich eine große Zahl sorbischer Siedler im Tal der Orte Oderwitz, Eibau, Walddorf und Ebersbach nieder. Wann sorbische Sprache und Sitten aus diesen Orten verschwanden, ist nicht bekannt, wahrscheinlich aber erst, als sich deutsche Ritter mit ihrem Gefolge dort niederließen und die Gegend germanisierten. Zwischen 1050 und 1150 entstand die erste Kirche am Hang des Landwassers.', 'Erste urkundliche Erwähnung.', 'Die erste urkundliche Erwähnung von Oderwitz stammt vom 15. Mai 1324, das Dorf hatte damals noch den Namen \\"Odrowitz\\". Da Oderwitz 1384 in einem Zehntenverzeichnis der Prager erzbischöflichen Bibliothek für das Zittauer Dekanat mit der höchsten Summe von 28 Groschen genannt wird, kann davon ausgegangen werden, dass es schon zu dieser Zeit sehr bedeutend war. Dafür spricht auch, dass bereits 1350 zwischen Ober- und Niederoderwitz unterschieden wurde.', '14. bis 16. Jahrhundert – Wechselnde Herrschaften und Hussitenkriege.', 'Die ersten Bewohner von Oderwitz waren noch völlig frei, ab 1368 begann die herrschaftliche Trennung des Ortes in mehrere Anteile sowie die Leibeigenschaft der Bauern. Die ältesten bekannten Grundherren von Oderwitz waren Heinrich von Reydenburg und Heinrich von Bolberitz, die 1395 und 1396 Kirchenpatrone des Ortes waren. Kurz darauf ging der Besitz an die Burggrafen von Dohna über, die nun die Oberlehnsherren des Dorfes waren. Ende des 14. Jahrhunderts gelangten Teile von Oderwitz in den Besitz der Herren von Kyaw und von Nostitz, wohl Lehnsleute derer von Dohna. Der Anteil der Familie von Kyaw blieb bis Ende des 15. Jahrhunderts in deren Besitz. Den Anteil der Adelsfamilie Nostitz verkaufte Heinrich von Nostitz bereits 1412 an die Johanniterkommende in Zittau.', 'Nach der Verbrennung des Reformators Jan Hus auf dem Konzil zu Konstanz am 6. Juli 1415 wüteten die Hussitenkriege von 1419 bis 1439 im Königreich Böhmen. Zwischen 1425 und 1431 fielen die Hussiten achtmal in die Oberlausitz ein; auch Oderwitz wurde mehrmals angegriffen oder besetzt. Die letzte große Schlacht ereignete sich 1469, bei der Zittau von feindlichen Truppen eingenommen wurde. Nach Ende des Krieges wurde der frühere Gutsbesitzer von Mitteloderwitz enteignet, da er mit den Hussiten paktiert hatte. Das Gut ging in den Besitz von Hugold von Schleinitz über, der 1490 auch die Anteile der Familie Dohna erwarb. Man nimmt an, dass er Besitzer und Oberlehnsherr von ganz Oderwitz wurde. Sein Sohn Heinrich von Schleinitz vergrößerte den Besitz seines Vaters, er besaß Anfang des 16. Jahrhunderts einen zusammenhängenden Grundbesitz von über 70 Quadratkilometern, der das \\"Schleinitzer Ländchen\\" genannt wurde.', 'Im Jahr 1515 verkaufte Heinrich von Schleinitz einen Teil von Oderwitz an das Cölestinerkloster a: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Oderwitz, Sachsen, Gemeinde, Fusion, Landkreis Görlitz, Oberlausitz, slawische Siedlung, Landwirtschaft, Webereien, Bockwindmühlen"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: [['Geboren 1858', 'Gestorben 1899', 'Maler (Italien)', 'Maler (Schweiz)', 'Maler des Symbolismus', 'Mann', 'Person (Kaisertum Österreich)', 'Person (Kanton Graubünden)', 'Philosoph (19.

September 1899 auf dem Schafberg bei Pontresina, Kanton Graubünden, Schweiz; vollständiger Name \\"Giovanni Battista Emanuele Maria Segatini\\") war ein in Welschtirol als österreichischer Staatsbürger geborener Maler des realistischen Symbolismus. Er galt als Meister der Hochgebirgslandschaft und begann früh mit der Freilichtmalerei. Segantini entwickelte eine eigene Version der pointillistischen Maltechnik, mit deren Hilfe er das ungebrochene Licht der Hochgebirgswelt wiedergeben und die naturalistische Wirkung seiner Bilder steigern konnte.', 'Leben.', 'Herkunft.', 'Die Familie Segatini stammte aus dem an der Etsch bei Verona gelegenen Bussolengo, das durch seine Leinen- und Seidenweberei bekannt war. Auch Johannes Maria Segatini (* 3. Mai 1718), der Urgroßvater von Giovanni Segantini, sowie sein Großvater Anton Giovanni Segatini (* 7. Mai 1743) widmeten sich diesem Gewerbe. Nachdem die Seidenweberei und der damit verbundene Handel in der zweiten Hälfte des 18. Jahrhunderts stark zurückgegangen waren, wanderte mit den Arbeitern der Großvater ins Trentino aus und ließ sich als Seidenweber in Ala nieder, wo sich eine blühende Seidenindustrie entwickeln sollte. Zwischen 1788 und 1802 wurden ihm acht Söhne geboren, darunter als jüngster Agostino Segatini, der der Vater des Künstlers werden sollte. Aloisio Segatini, ein älterer Bruder von Agostino, ließ sich als erster der Familie in Trient nieder, der jüngere Bruder kam später nach und gab das alte Familiengewerbe auf, um Käsehändler zu werden.', 'Segantinis Mutter, Margherita Girardi, entstammte einem in Castello-Molina de Fiemme sesshaften alten Fleimstaler Geschlecht. Margherita Girardi war eine direkte Nachfahrin Francesco Girardis, eines kaiserlichen Hofrats und Obersts, „der die tirolischen Milizen organisierte und Verfasser einer in der Militärliteratur klassisch gewordenen Publikation, dem ‚Handbüchl zum Exercieren‘“. Der Name Girardi ist im ladinischen Gebiet stark verbreitet, und man findet ihn zudem außerhalb des Fleimstals im Gebiet des Rollepasses, zu Füßen des Cimone della Pala und im Ampezzotal, von wo fernerhin Alexander Girardi herstammte.', 'Frühe Jahre (1858–1875).', 'Giovanni Battista Emanuele Maria Segatini, so sein eigentlicher Name, den er später in Segantini änderte, wurde 1858 im damals österreichischen Arco nördlich des Gardasees als Kind des Schreiners Agostino Segatini (* 1802; † 20. Februar 1866) und seiner dritten Frau, Margherita de Girardi (* 4. September 1828 in Castello; † 3. März 1865 in Trient) geboren. Ein um sechs Jahre älterer Bruder kam am 20. Juli 1858 bei einem Brand ums Leben.', 'Nach dem frühen Tod der Mutter (sie starb mit 36 Jahren) brachte ihn der alkoholkranke Vater zu einer Tochter aus erster Ehe, Irene. Diese empfand den Kleinen als Belastung, und Giovanni riss deshalb aus, wann immer es ging. Im Juli 1865 trieb der Hass die Halbschwester so weit, dass sie in einem Schreiben an die Innsbrucker Behörde dazu aufforderte, Giovanni die österreichische Staatsangehörigkeit zu entziehen. Dies geschah: Nach den repressiven Gesetzen, die im damaligen Kaiserreich Österreich für die italienischen Herrschaftsgebiete galten, konnte einem Siebenjährigen die Staatsangehörigkeit entzogen werden.', 'Segantini blieb sein ganzes Leben staatenlos. 1870 wurde er ohne Papiere aufgegriffen, und da sein Vater gestorben war, landete er in der Erziehungsanstalt \\"Riformatorio Marchiondi\\". Dort erlernte er den Beruf des Schusters. Ein alter Anstaltsgeistlicher nahm sich seiner an. Er erkannte seine zeichnerische Begabung, erzählte ihm vom Malermönch Fra Angelico und erlaubte ihm, zu zeichnen und zu modellieren. Durch Interventionen seines Halbbruders Napoleone konnte er 1873 die Besserungsanstalt verlassen und arbeitete bis 1874 in dessen Photo- und Drogeriegeschäft in Borgo Valsugana. Daraufhin kam er nach Mailand und arbeitete seit 1875 beim ehemaligen Garibaldi-Anhänger Luigi Tettamanzi, einem Maler von Heiligenfahnen, Transparenten und Wirtshausschildern, Komödiant und Verfasser historischer Dramen. Tettamanzi stellte ihn als Gehilfen an und erteilte ihm Zeichenunterricht.', 'Mailand (1875–1880).', 'Im Jahr 1875 schrieb er sich an der Kunstakademie Brera in Mailand ein, belegte Tageskurse in Malerei und Abendkurse in Ornamentik. Bei einer nationalen Ausstellung der Brera erregte er bereits 1879 mit seinem ersten größeren Bild, dem \\"Chorgestühl von Sant’Antonio\\", bei Lehrern und Schülern Aufsehen durch die neuartige Behandlung des Lichts.', '„Ich war sicher nicht darauf bedacht, ein Kunstwerk zu schaffen, sondern mich einfach in der Malerei zu betätigen. Durch ein geöffnetes Fenster drang ein Lichtstrom ein, der die in Holz geschnitzten Sitze des Chores mit Helligkeit übergoß. Ich malte diesen Teil und bemühte mich vor allem, das Licht festzuhalten, und sogleich begriff ich dabei, daß man beim Mischen der Farben auf der Palette weder Licht noch Luft bekam. So fand ich das Mittel, die Farben echt und rein anzuordnen, indem ich auf der Leinwand die Farben, die ich sonst auf der Palette gemischt hätte, ungemischt die eine neben die andere setzte und dann es der Netzhaut überließ, sie beim Betrachten des Gemäldes auf ihre natürliche Entfernung zu verschmelzen.“', 'Das durch ein Seitenfenster belichtete Chorgestühl von „Sant’Antonio“ galt damals bei den Perspektive-Schülern als unlösbares Problem. Man wollte Segantini den mit 5000 Lire dotierten „Principe-Umberto-Preis“ verleihen. Neider und Feinde wussten dies zu verhindern, indem sie die Jury darauf aufmerksam machten, dass Segantini Österreicher und kein Italiener war. Das Bild wurde von der \\"Gesellschaft der Schönen Künste von Mailand\\" erworben. Später bekam er den Auftrag, für die Studenten kolorierte anatomische Zeichnungen anzufertigen, wodurch er sich selbst gute anatomische Kenntnisse aneignete.', 'Wegen Meinungsverschiedenheiten mit den Professoren an der Brera verließ er diese nach zwei Jahren. Im selben Jahr lernte er in der „Galleria Vittore ed Alberto Grubicy“ in Mailand den Kunstkritiker und -händler Vittore Grubicy de Dragon (1851–1920) kennen. Die Galerie veranstaltete eine Gedächtnisausstellung für den früh verstorbenen Tranquillo Cremona (1837–1878). Segantini betrat die Ausstellung in ärmlicher Kleidung und groben Schuhen. Er wurde von Grubicy zurechtgewiesen, betrachtete die Gemälde weiterhin aufmerksam, entschuldigte sich und gab sich als Maler zu erkennen. So begann eine Beziehung und Freundschaft fürs Leben, und die finanzielle Not Segantinis hatte vorerst ein Ende, denn Grubicy verschaffte ihm Aufträge für Stillleben und brachte die Bilder Segantinis in den Kunsthandel. Zudem brachte ihn der weitgereiste Grubicy mit Reproduktionen von Kunst seiner Zeit in Berührung, was für Segantini eine der wenigen Möglichkeiten war, Kenntnis vom Luminismus der Haager Schule, dem Neoimpressionismus und über andere Künstler wie beispielsweise Anton Mauve und Jean-François Millet und ihre Werke zu erhalten.', 'Brianza (1880–1886).', 'Im Jahr 1880 bezog Segantini sein erstes Atelier in der Via San Marco nahe der Navigli in Mailand, das er als Mailänder Domizil behielt. Hier lernte er die siebzehnjährige Luigia Bugatti (1863–1938) kennen, genannt Bice, die Schwester seines Mitschülers und Freundes Carlo Bugatti, der später in Mailand und Paris ein gesuchter Möbelschreiner wurde. Bice stand Modell für das Bild \\"La Falconiera\\" (Die Falknerin) aus dem Jahre 1880, ein romantisches Bild, das die Verliebtheit des Malers widerspiegelt. Die Heldin des Bildes heißt \\"„Bice del Balzo“\\" und nahm in den Augen des verliebten Malers „irdische Gestalt in den weiblichen Formen der geliebten Luigia Bugatti an, die von nun an seine Bice wurde.“ Heiraten konnten sie nicht, da er nicht über die notwendigen Papiere verfügte.', '1881 zog er mit Bice nach Pusiano in der Brianza, einer ländlichen, hügeligen Seenlandschaft zwischen Lecco und Mailand. Das Paar bekam dort zwei Söhne: Gottardo Guido (1882–1974), später selbst Maler und Biograf seines Vaters, und Alberto (1883–1904). Sein dritter Sohn Mario (März 1885–1916) und die Tochter Bianca (Mai 1886–1980) wurden später in Mailand geboren. Mario wurde ebenfalls Maler und Bianca brachte 1909 in Leipzig die Schriften und Briefe ihres Vaters in deutscher Sprache heraus. 1882 bezog die Familie Segantini einen Herrschaftssitz in Carella, wo Segantini den lombardischen Maler Emilio Longoni (1859–1932) kennenlernte, der eine Zeitlang im selben Haus lebte und arbeitete.', 'Segantini studierte ausführlich die „Natura morta“ und entwickelte in zahlreichen Stillleben eine naturnahe Malerei. Oft malte er Blumen, da sie für ihn die reine Schönheit der Natur verkörperten. Hier, am Lago di Pusiano, entstand 1882 die erste Fassung von \\"Ave Maria auf der Überfahrt\\", welche zwei Jahre später an einer Ausstellung in Amsterdam ausgezeichnet werden sollte. Diese erste Fassung ist nicht mehr erhalten.', 'Am 20. Januar 1883 unterzeichneten Segantini und Grubicy einen Vertrag, worin Segantini seinen Mäzen und Händler ermächtigte, Bilder mit dem Monogramm \\"„G.S.“\\" zu signieren, ihn in allen öffentlichen und privaten Belangen zu vertreten sowie über sein Schaffen und seinen Besitz zu verfügen.', '1884 verließ Segantini mit seiner Familie Carella und zog nach Corneno. 1885 bis 1886 hielt er sich ein halbes Jahr in Caglio in der Lombardei, wenige Kilometer von Carella entfernt, auf. In einem seiner bedeutendsten Werke, \\"An der Stange\\", einer großflächigen, lichtvollen und weiträumigen Komposition, fasste er die Erfahrungen in der Brianza zusammen. Das Bild stellte die bisherige Summe seiner malerischen Entwicklung dar und nahm etwas von seinem Triptychon \\"Sein, Werden, Vergehen\\" vorweg.', 'Savognin (1886–1894).', 'Der Landschaft überdrüssig, verließ Segantini 1886 die Brianza, zog für sechs Monate mit seiner Familie nach Mailand und führte Auftragsarbeiten für das lombardische Großbürgertum aus.

Sie wurde unter der Leitung von Ralph Baer entwickelt und in technisch leicht modifizierter Form von Magnavox produziert. Ab September 1972 zunächst nur in den USA angeboten, kamen im Jahr darauf weitere internationale Absatzgebiete hinzu. In der Bundesrepublik Deutschland beispielsweise übernahm ITT Schaub-Lorenz 1973 den Vertrieb des dort Odyssee genannten Geräts.', 'Im Gegensatz zu später erschienenen Geräten wie etwa Atari 2600 und Philips G 7000 ist in der Odyssey-Konsole kein Mikroprozessor verbaut. Auch einfachere integrierte Schaltkreise mit beispielsweise Logikgattern kommen nicht zum Einsatz. Die gesamte elektronische Verarbeitung erfolgt ausschließlich mithilfe diskreter Bauelemente wie Transistoren und Dioden, wodurch die Leistungsfähigkeit sehr gering ausfällt. So beschränkt sich die Darstellung am Fernseher auf grob aufgelöste Schwarzweiß-Bilder, eine Tonuntermalung ist nicht vorhanden.', 'Nach über 350.000 verkauften Geräten stellte Magnavox im Frühjahr 1975 die Produktion zugunsten der Nachfolgemodelle Odyssey 100 und Odyssey 200 ein. Trotz ihrer Einfachheit gilt die retrospektiv häufig auch Magnavox Odyssey genannte Konsole als revolutionäres Gerät: Sie habe vielen Rezensenten zufolge sowohl in technischer, wirtschaftlicher als auch kultureller Hinsicht Geschichte geschrieben.', 'Geschichte.', 'Im September 1966 konzipierte der in die USA eingewanderte Ralph Henry Baer erstmals ein Zusatzgerät für Fernseher, mit dessen Hilfe er interaktive TV-Spiele für jeden Haushalt möglich machen wollte. Der darzustellende Inhalt sollte in die Antennenbuchse, die in jedem Fernsehgerät verbaut war, eingespeist werden. Darin und in seinem kommerziellen Anspruch – Mitte der 1960er Jahre befanden sich etwa 40 Millionen Fernseher in US-amerikanischen Haushalten – unterschied sich Baers Vorhaben von anderen elektronisch generierten Spielen mit Bildsichtgerät. Diese existierten bereits seit Ende der 1940er Jahre im universitären Umfeld und in Forschungslaboratorien, waren aber häufig nur wissenschaftlichem Personal und Studenten zugänglich (vgl. Geschichte der Videospiele 1947–1969).', 'Entwicklung.', 'Der studierte Fernsehtechniker Baer stellte eine erste noch elektronenröhrenbasierte Machbarkeitsstudie des Geräts Ende 1966 seinem Arbeitgeber Sanders Associates vor. Überzeugt von dem Entwurf, bewilligte das auf elektronische Komponenten spezialisierte US-amerikanische Rüstungsunternehmen kurz darauf Geldmittel und Personal für ein entsprechendes Entwicklungsprojekt unter Baers Leitung.', 'Erste Entwürfe und Brown Box.', 'Nach dem Beginn der Arbeiten im Februar 1967 konnte Baer und sein aus William L. Harrison und William T. Rusch bestehendes Entwicklerteam bereits im Mai konkrete Vorschläge für die zu implementierenden Spiele vorlegen. Ein erster vorführbereiter transistorbasierter Prototyp, der auch Spiele zum Gebrauch mit einem Lichtgewehr umfasste, wurde der Firmenleitung von Sanders im Juni vorgestellt. Nachdem dieser für gut befunden worden war, stockte man umgehend Baers Entwicklungsbudget auf.', 'Es schlossen sich Untersuchungen zum Aufbau des Geräts mithilfe unterschiedlicher elektronischer Technologien an. Dazu gehörte beispielsweise die Verwendung integrierter Schaltkreise in Diode-Transistor- und Widerstands-Transistor-Logik, aber auch von emittergekoppelten Gattern. Deren Einsatz erwies sich angesichts des von Baer anvisierten Verkaufspreises von 25 US-Dollar (entspräche heute inflationsbereinigt ca. Euro) für das fertige Gerät als unwirtschaftlich. Es blieb daher bei Dioden-Transistor-Logik mit preisgünstigen diskreten Bauelementen.', 'Im November 1967 stellte Baer firmenintern einen fortgeschrittenen Prototypen vor, der erstmals auch ein Ping-Pong-Spiel und dazugehörige Drehregler enthielt. Im Januar 1969 schließlich stand ein weiterer, weitestgehend ausgereifter Prototyp, die Brown Box, zu Vorführzwecken für potentielle Lizenznehmer bereit. Dieses gänzlich mit Holzimitatfolie verblendete Gerät enthielt neben Lichtgewehr- und Verfolgungsspielen auch einige Ping-Pong-Variationen. Zwischenzeitlich aufgekommene Entwürfe mit zeitgemäßer Transistor-Transistor-Logik in Form integrierter Schaltkreise der 74xx-Reihe – auch in damals neuartiger CMOS-Technik – waren ebenfalls dem Kostendruck zum Opfer gefallen.', 'Anpassungen durch Magnavox.', 'Nach der im Januar 1971 erfolgten Lizenzierung an Magnavox, einem der damals größten Hersteller von Fernsehgeräten, ging die weitere Produktentwicklung des firmenintern 1TL200 genannten Geräts auf die dortigen Ingenieure über. Die zugrundeliegenden, von Baer, Harrison und Rusch erarbeiteten Spielevorschläge und technischen Lösungen waren zuvor von Sanders zu verschiedenen Patenten angemeldet worden.', 'Unter der Leitung von George Kent wurden durch Magnavox zunächst einige Überarbeitungen an der Brown Box vorgenommen, um die Herstellungskosten zu senken. So übernahm man von den Controllern lediglich die Drehregler, stattete diese aber mit einem zusätzlichen Knopf zum Neustart eines Spiels aus. Das Lichtgewehr plante Magnavox als optional erhältliches Zubehör; ein dritter von Baers Team entwickelter Controllertyp entfiel gänzlich, ebenso die Baugruppe zur Ausgabe eines farbigen Bildhintergrundes. Als preiswerten Ersatz für letztere führte man stattdessen kolorierte Folien ein, die elektrostatisch am Fernsehbildschirm hafteten. Magnavox verzichtete zudem auf den Spielewählschalter der Brown Box zugunsten von sechs Drahtbrückenkarten. Die Spiele selbst entsprachen im Wesentlichen den Entwürfen von Baer, Harrison und Rusch. Ron Bradford und Steve Lehner erweiterten und kombinierten diese jedoch mit zusätzlichen Elementen wie Spielkarten, Spielgeld und Würfel, die später jeder Konsole beigelegt waren. Neben der Technik und den Spielen überarbeitete Magnavox auch das optische Erscheinungsbild. Das Gerät und die gestalterisch darauf abgestimmten Controller erhielten futuristisch anmutende Gehäuse in zweifarbigem Plastik. Bis Mai 1971 erfolgte die Abnahme zur elektromagnetischen Verträglichkeit durch die US-amerikanische Federal Communications Commission (FCC) – eine maßgebliche Voraussetzung zur Verkaufbarkeit des Geräts in den USA.', 'Vermarktung.', 'Um die Akzeptanz unter potentiellen Käufern und damit die Marktchancen zu evaluieren, wurden zunächst in verschiedenen US-amerikanischen Städten Vorführmuster mit dem Namen Skill-O-Vision ausgestellt. Vermutlich wegen des ähnlich klingenden Smell-O-Vision, einem Entwurf für geruchsbegleitetes Fernsehen von Michael Todd, änderte Magnavox nach den erfolgreich verlaufenden Vermarktungstests den Namen seines Gerätes in Odyssey. Die neue Bezeichnung geht dabei wahrscheinlich auf Stanley Kubricks populären Film \\"\\" zurück. Im Mai 1972 hatte Magnavox seine sämtlichen Fachhändler mit der Konsole vertraut gemacht und am 22. Mai auch die Öffentlichkeit auf einer Pressekonferenz in New York informiert. Nur wenig später startete im US-amerikanischen Tennessee die Produktion der 100.000 für 1972 geplanten Geräte. Die Herstellungskosten lagen den Angaben Baers zufolge dabei zwischen 40 und 50 US-Dollar pro Konsole.', 'Markteinführung und Werbekampagne.', 'Die Konsole war ab September 1972 in den USA ausschließlich bei Magnavox-Fachhändlern zu einem Preis von 99,95 US-Dollar (entspräche heute inflationsbereinigt ca. Euro) erhältlich. Zum Lieferumfang gehörten neben dem Gerät mit seinen beiden Controllern sechs Drahtbrückenkarten, eine Antennenweiche, sechs Batterien (Größe C) und Zubehör für die Spiele. Ein Netzteil, der Lichtgewehr-Controller und weitere Spiele waren optional erhältlich.', 'Der Verkaufsstart wurde von einer landesweiten Werbekampagne begleitet. Dabei setzte Magnavox neben klassischer Printwerbung in Form von Zeitungsanzeigen, Hochglanzprospekten, Pappaufstellern und ähnlichem auch auf Rundfunkausstrahlungen in Radio und Fernsehen. Man pries darin die Konsole als „eine neue Dimension des Fernsehens“ und als das „Spiel der Zukunft“ an. Die gesamte Familie könne damit am Fernsehen teilhaben und sei nicht länger nur bloßer Zuschauer. Der „elektronische Spielesimulator“ eigne sich insbesondere auch für Kinder zum „unterhaltsamen Lernen“ von Zahlen, Buchstaben und zum Erweitern der Geographiekenntnisse.', 'Die allgegenwärtige Werbung verfehlte ihre Wirkung nicht – bei vielen Händlern waren die Geräte innerhalb kurzer Zeit ausverkauft. Überrascht von den Verkaufszahlen, erhöhte Magnavox daraufhin den Produktionsausstoß. Das Kaufinteresse erlahmte jedoch unerwartet und die Absätze brachen bereits gegen Ende des Jahres ein. Die Verkaufszahlen für das Jahr 1972 – die Angaben schwanken zwischen 69.000 und etwa 100.000 Stück – lagen damit deutlich unter den von Magnavox prognostizierten und bereits vorproduzierten 140.000 Geräten. Baer zufolge erwog Magnavox daraufhin 1973 den Rückzug aus dem Telespielgeschäft, eine Idee, die wegen zwischenzeitlich wieder angezogener Verkäufe nur wenig später wieder verworfen wurde.', 'Weltweiter Verkauf.', '1973 begann Magnavox mit der Erschließung weiterer Märkte vor allem in Europa. Auf der Internationalen Funkausstellung in Westberlin beispielsweise stellte der regionale Distributor ITT Schaub-Lorenz erstmals eine für den bundesdeutschen Markt bestimmte Version vor. Dieses \\"Odyssee\\" genannte Gerät war dann ab Oktober im Handel für rund 400 DM (entspräche heute inflationsbereinigt ca. Euro) erhältlich. Beworben wurde das Produkt auf der Verpackung und in Printmedien als „elektronisches Fernsehspiel für die gesamte Familie“. Der in Anzeigen verwendete Slogan „Das vierte Programm“ betonte insbesondere die nun vom öffentlich-rechtlichen Rundfunk unabhängige Nutzung des heimischen Fernsehers und seine mögliche Transformation „zum Fussballstadium, zum Tennisplatz, zum Schießstand oder gar zum Weltraum“.', 'In anderen westeuropäischen Ländern war die Konsole ebenfalls erhältlich, darunter in Frankreich und Italien. Daneben boten einige Hersteller ab 1973 in Europa auch nicht lizenzierte Nachbauten wie das spanische \\"Overkal\\" an.

The study discovered that SSM has contributed significantly to the local economy, creating employment opportunities and offering alternative livelihoods for many households. However, it also identified various challenges, such as environmental degradation and tense community relations. The opportunities and constraints faced by SSMs in Odzi are influenced by factors such as local socio-economic conditions, resource availability, socio-cultural dynamics, and the political landscape. Addressing these constraints requires a collaborative effort from various stakeholders, including government, NGOs, and the local community, to create an enabling environment that fosters sustainable and inclusive growth of the SSM sector. 5.2 Thematic Areas in Conclusions Based on the study’s findings, four thematic areas have emerged as vital aspects to be addressed for advancing the sustainable growth and development of SSMs in Odzi, Zimbabwe. These are: (1) capacity building and access to resources, (2) an enabling policy and regulatory framework, (3) engagement and collaboration among stakeholders, and (4) environmental stewardship and social well-being. 5.2.1 Capacity Building and Access to Resources The study revealed that SSMs in Odzi face challenges related to limited access to capital, technology, and information. To foster sustainable growth and development, it is essential to enhance their technical, managerial, and entrepreneurial skills through targeted training programs, creating funding opportunities, and offering technical support services. This, in turn, will improve their productivity, profitability, and compliance with industry standards and regulations. 5.2.2 Enabling Policy and Regulatory Framework The existing policy and regulatory framework in Zimbabwe contains several provisions to support SSMs. However, the study found the framework to be less effective due to weak enforcement, limited resources, and corruption. To address these challenges, it is crucial to review and reform the existing policy and regulatory framework to make it more conducive to the growth and development of SSMs. This includes simplifying licensing procedures, offering fiscal incentives, and strengthening provisions for addressing environmental and social concerns. 5.2.3 Engagement and Collaboration among Stakeholders The research also emphasized the need for greater stakeholder involvement in promoting the growth and development of SSMs in Odzi. Engaging stakeholders across a wide range of sectors, including government, NGOs, local communities, and SSMs themselves, is essential to arriving at a comprehensive and integrated approach to tackling the challenges faced by SSMs. This calls for joint initiatives on capacity building, technological innovation, environmental management, and policy advocacy, as well as platforms for dialogue and knowledge sharing among stakeholders. 5.2.4 Environmental Stewardship and Social Well-being Lastly, the study illuminated the environmental degradation and social tensions resulting from SSM activities in Odzi. To minimize these negative impacts, it is important to PLEASE start and continue from 5.2.4 and complete this chapter. Also provide an abstract that is powerful for the dissertation topic: THE OPPORTUNITIES AND CONSTRAINTS FACED BY SMALL SCALE MINERS IN ODZI, ZIMBABWE. Which is for a BA in Development Studies and also the chapter 5 is for the same topic","completion":"5.2.4 Environmental Stewardship and Social Well-being Lastly, the study illuminated the environmental degradation and social tensions resulting from SSM activities in Odzi. To minimize these negative impacts, it is important to promote sustainable mining practices and environmental stewardship among small scale miners. This can be achieved through initiatives like capacity-building workshops, provision of practical guidelines on environmental management, and engaging SSMs in community-based environmental projects. Additionally, fostering social cohesion and addressing the concerns of local communities is vital to ensuring the long-term sustainability of SSMs in the area. This involves facilitating dialogue between SSMs and community members, as well as integrating community needs and aspirations in SSM development plans. 5.3 Recommendations Based on the study's findings, the following recommendations are proposed to address the opportunities and constraints faced by SSMs in Odzi, Zimbabwe: 1. Develop and implement targeted capacity-building programs for SSMs to enhance their technical, managerial, and entrepreneurial skills. 2. Reform the policy and regulatory framework to create a more conducive environment for the growth and development of SSMs, including simplifying licensing procedures, offering fiscal incentives, and strengthening provisions for addressing environmental and social concerns. 3. Encourage stakeholder engagement and collaboration through joint initiatives on capacity building, technological innovation, environmental management, and policy advocacy, as well as platforms for dialogue and knowledge sharing among stakeholders. 4. Promote sustainable mining practices and environmental stewardship among SSMs through capacity-building workshops, provision of practical guidelines on environmental management, and engaging SSMs in community-based environmental projects. 5. Foster social cohesion and address the concerns of local communities by facilitating dialogue between SSMs and community members, and integrating community needs and aspirations in SSM development plans. 5.4 Areas for Further Research While this study has provided insights into the opportunities and constraints faced by small scale miners in Odzi, Zimbabwe, it also highlights several areas for further research: 1. Investigate the impact of government policies and programs on the SSM sector, focusing on their effectiveness, challenges, and possible areas for improvement. 2.

Explore the role of gender in the SSM sector, particularly in terms of access to resources, decision-making processes, and the distribution of benefits and opportunities. 4. Assess the potential for integrating sustainable livelihood approaches and alternative income-generating activities in small scale mining communities, to promote social and economic resilience. 5. Evaluate the impact of emerging trends like digitalization, technological innovations, and market dynamics on the opportunities and constraints faced by SSMs in Zimbabwe. Abstract This study investigates the opportunities and constraints faced by small scale miners (SSMs) in Odzi, Zimbabwe. Small scale mining significantly contributes to the local economy, creating employment opportunities and offering alternative livelihoods for many households. However, it also results in environmental degradation and social tensions. The research highlights four thematic areas that need to be addressed for the sustainable growth and development of SSMs in Odzi: capacity building and access to resources; an enabling policy and regulatory framework; engagement and collaboration among stakeholders; and, environmental stewardship and social well-being. Key recommendations include targeted capacity-building programs, policy and regulatory reforms, stakeholder engagement, promoting sustainable mining practices, and fostering social cohesion. Further research should focus on government policies, comparative studies, gender dynamics, sustainable livelihood approaches, and the impact of emerging trends on SSMs in Zimbabwe."},{"prompt":"Please provide a concise, robust and comprehensive abstract for the dissertation topic for a BA in Development Studies called; THE OPPORTUNITIES AND CONSTRAINTS FACED BY SMALL SCALE MINERS IN ODZI, ZIMBABWE.

However, they critiqued that the framework is not fully effective due to weak enforcement, limited resources, and corruption. Furthermore, some aspects of the policy and regulatory framework were found to be unfavorable to SSMs, such as the complex licensing process and inadequate provisions for addressing environmental and social issues.","completion":"4.6 The Policy and Regulatory Framework of SSMs Participants in the study acknowledged the presence of various policies and regulations aimed at supporting the SSM sector in Zimbabwe. Despite these provisions being in place, the participants pointed out that the effectiveness of the policy and regulatory framework in fostering the growth and development of SSMs is hindered by multiple challenges. The issues primarily include weak enforcement of regulations, insufficient resources for monitoring and implementation, and prevalence of corruption within the system. Moreover, the participants highlighted certain elements within the policy and regulatory framework that seem unfavorable to the SSM sector. One critical element identified was the complexity of the licensing process, which tends to discourage potential miners from entering the sector or forces existing miners to operate informally. This situation exacerbates the lack of transparency and accountability within the industry, further undermining the effectiveness of policies and regulations. Another area of concern raised by the participants was the inadequacy of provisions addressing environmental and social concerns associated with SSMs. The existing framework does not comprehensively cover essential aspects such as environmental management, land reclamation, and community engagement, leading to negative impacts on the environment, public health, and overall social cohesion. These findings indicate that there is a need for revising and strengthening the existing policy and regulatory framework in Zimbabwe to ensure it is conducive to the sustainable growth and development of the SSM sector. This would entail simplifying the licensing procedures, allocating resources for monitoring and enforcement, tackling corruption, and bolstering provisions addressing environmental and social challenges associated with small-scale mining."},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: [['Segeln', 'Wassersportart'], 'Segeln ist die Fortbewegung eines Segelschiffs oder eines Segelboots unter Nutzung der Windenergie.', 'Segelschiffe hatten über viele Jahrhunderte weltweit eine große Bedeutung für Handel und Transport, Kriegsführung und Fischfang.

Die Nester einiger dieser Arten werden für die „Schwalbennestersuppe“ verwendet, eine Delikatesse der Chinesischen Küche, was Schutzmaßnahmen erforderlich macht, um weitere Bestandsrückgänge zu vermeiden.', 'Merkmale.', 'Morphologie und Anatomie.', 'Das auffälligste Merkmal der Segler ist ihre offenkundig für das Fliegen mit hohen Geschwindigkeiten geeignete Gestalt. Dieser Eindruck entsteht durch ihren länglichen, stromlinienförmigen Körper mit kurzem Hals, den nach vorn gestreckten Kopf und vor allem durch die langen, schlanken, bei den meisten Arten sichelförmigen Flügel. Der Schnabel ist kurz und breit, zweckdienlich bei der Luftjagd nach Kleintieren. Die relativ großen Augen werden bei allen Arten durch eine oberhalb des Auges vorstehende, feine pinselartige Federreihe geschützt.', 'Das Gefieder ist meist dunkel, häufig schwarz, bei vielen Arten aber auch dunkelgrau oder braun. Häufig finden sich hellere oder weiße Gefiederteile, insbesondere weisen viele Arten einen hellen Kehlfleck oder Bürzel auf. Ein buntes Gefieder zeigt keine der Arten, lediglich die rötlichen Kehlen des Rothals- und Orangekehlseglers – zweier nahe verwandter, südamerikanischer Segler der Gattung \\"Streptoprocne\\" – zeigen eine Tendenz zu auffälliger Färbung. Viele Arten haben ein stark glänzendes Gefieder, manche davon mit einem bläulichen oder grünlichen Schimmer. Die Funktion dieses bei allen Seglern zumindest in frisch vermausertem Gefieder vorhandenen Gefiederglanzes ist unklar, möglicherweise ist die dadurch erhöhte Albedo (Reflexionsvermögen) zum Schutz des Gefieders vorteilhaft, da die Vögel als Luftjäger verhältnismäßig lang der Sonne ausgesetzt sind – auch die meisten Schwalbenarten zeigen einen solchen Glanz.', 'Der kurze, kräftige Klammerfuß mit seinen scharfen Krallen und der sehr kurze Lauf eignen sich hervorragend, um sich an senkrechten Oberflächen festzuklammern, was durch die steifen Schwanzfedern unterstützt wird. Zur Fortbewegung am Boden dagegen eignen sich die Füße der Segler kaum – auf Zweigen können sie nicht sitzen, nur daran hängen. Fast alle Segler haben vier Zehen, mit Ausnahme der Papuasalangane (\\"Aerodramus papuensis\\"), der die erste Zehe fehlt. Bei vielen Arten sind einige der Zehen wendbar, an glatten Flächen können dabei alle vier Zehen nach vorne gerichtet werden. Diese Stellung der Zehen ist vor allem auch bei Museumsexemplaren zu beobachten – deshalb wurde den Seglern eine pamprodactyle Zehenanordnung unterstellt, funktional ist sie aber eigentlich eher heterodactyl.', 'Die Form des vergleichsweise kurzen Schwanzes ist bei den verschiedenen Seglerarten recht unterschiedlich. Insbesondere bei den typischen Seglern (Apodini) ist eine Schwanzgabelung weit verbreitet, während die Salanganen nur einen leicht eingekerbten Schwanz zeigen. Bei den Stachelschwanzseglern (Chaeturini) wiederum ragen die Federkiele der Steuerfedern über die Fahnen hinaus. Diese über das Ende der recht kurzen, gerade abgeschnittenen oder gerundeten Schwänze hinausragenden „Schwanzdornen“ unterstützen die Vögel bei der Fortbewegung an glatten Oberflächen. Sowohl die gegabelten Schwänze als auch die Schwanzdornen sind dabei aerodynamisch vorteilhaft, da sie die Luftverwirbelung mindern. Segler haben meist zehn Steuerfedern, eine prominente Ausnahme ist der Mauersegler mit zwölf.', 'Die Größenunterschiede innerhalb der Familie sind deutlich, die kleinsten Arten wiegen knapp 8 Gramm, die größten Arten übertreffen Amseln und wiegen bis zu 180 Gramm.', 'Flug.', 'Die bei Vögeln einmalige lange und schlanke Flügelform erzeugt vor allem während des häufig zu beobachtenden Schlagflugs starken Auf- und Vortrieb. Insofern mag die Bezeichnung „Segler“ etwas übertrieben sein, aber auch der Gleitflug ist höchst effektiv, was der Vergleich der Stoffwechselraten während des Fluges mit anderen Vogelarten zeigt. Die Flügel haben neun oder zehn Handschwingen sowie acht bis elf dicht angeordnete, recht kurze Armschwingen. Die Knochen der Hand leisten bei Seglern einen überproportionalen Beitrag zur Flügellänge, was sich auch am deutlichen Längenunterschied zwischen Hand- und Armschwingen widerspiegelt. Die längste Handschwinge kann dreimal so lang sein wie die kürzeste Armschwinge – im Vergleich zur lediglich doppelten Länge bei den eine ähnliche ökologische Nische besetzenden Schwalben.', 'Die Flügelform ermöglicht den Seglern hohe Fluggeschwindigkeiten. Als schnellster Segler gilt der Stachelschwanzsegler (\\"Hirunsapus caudacutus\\") mit 170 km/h im horizontalen Schlagflug, nach derzeitigem Kenntnisstand ist er damit in dieser Disziplin sogar der schnellste Vogel der Welt. Verglichen mit anderen in ähnlicher Weise Luftjagd betreibenden Vögeln wie den Schwalben fehlt es den Seglern allerdings an Manövrierfähigkeit, sie sind nicht in der Lage, mit niedriger Geschwindigkeit zu fliegen.', 'Mauser.', 'Bei vielen ziehenden Arten beginnt die Jahresmauser bei der Ankunft im Winterquartier. Bei anderen Seglern kann die Mauser schon im Brutgebiet beginnen und wird dann während des Zuges unterbrochen und im Winterquartier vollendet. Andere Arten, insbesondere die der Gattung \\"Chaetura\\", wechseln ihr Gefieder während der Brutzeit.', 'Vom Mauersegler kennt man eine Besonderheit, die vermutlich auch für andere in gemäßigten Breiten brütende Seglerarten zutrifft: Nach dem Ausfliegen wechseln die Jungvögel ihr Gefieder nur teilweise, so dass die Schwungfedern erst beim zweiten Aufenthalt im Winterquartier nach eineinhalb Jahren erneuert werden. Da obendrein nicht bei jeder Mauser die äußersten Handschwingen gewechselt werden, kann es sein, dass diese Federn erst nach zweieinhalb Jahren vermausert werden.', 'Eine genaue Kenntnis der Mauserzyklen ist für die Bestimmung der Seglerarten nicht unbedingt nötig, allerdings kann die dabei auftretende Änderung der Flügelform durchaus Verwirrung stiften. Vertreter der Gattung \\"Apus\\" können beispielsweise während der Mauser eine Flügelform zeigen, die an die Stachelschwanzsegler (Chaeturini) erinnert.', 'Lautäußerungen.', 'Segler sind sehr ruffreudig, besonders während der Brutzeit. Zu den warmen Sommerabenden vieler mitteleuropäischer Städte gehören die hohen, schrillen Schreie der Mauersegler, die sogar den Verkehrslärm übertönen können. Die Rufe der meisten Seglerarten klingen recht ähnlich, ermöglichen aber – zumindest beim Mauersegler – die Unterscheidung der Geschlechter. Erich Kaiser hat 1997 herausgefunden, dass beim sogenannten „Duettieren“ am Brutplatz, bei dem ein Paar gemeinschaftlich ein \\"swii-rii\\" von sich gibt, das hellere \\"swii\\" vom Weibchen und das etwas tiefere \\"rii\\" vom Männchen stammt. Auf Partnersuche befindlichen Seglern, die den Eingang einer Bruthöhle anfliegen, wird mittels dieses Duetts auch angezeigt, ob sie ein potentieller Kandidat zur Gründung einer Familie sein können. Erich Kaiser vermutet, dass auch die anderen der vielen keinen äußerlichen Geschlechtsdimorphismus zeigenden Seglerarten, die dunkle Nistplätze bevorzugen, ihr Geschlecht auf diese Weise akustisch identifizieren.', 'Eine weitere sehr außergewöhnliche Anpassung der Segler sind die Klicklaute zur Echoortung, die vor allem bei vielen Salanganenarten zu vernehmen sind. Bei den Vögeln ist diese Fähigkeit sonst nur vom südamerikanischen Fettschwalm (\\"Steatornis caripensis\\") bekannt. Die Klicklaute der Segler liegen im hörbaren Frequenzbereich des Menschen, sie wurden verglichen mit dem Geräusch, wenn man mit dem Finger über die Zinken eines Kamms fährt. Die Echoortung ermöglicht den Seglern, sich in tiefen, weit verzweigen Höhlensystemen zurechtzufinden. Aufgrund der niedrigeren Frequenz gegenüber den Ultraschall verwendenden Fledermäusen ist die Auflösung nicht ausreichend, um in der Dunkelheit Insekten zu jagen. Möglicherweise können die Segler dadurch aber länger als andere Luftjäger in der Dämmerung aktiv bleiben, bevor sie ihre in den Höhlen befindlichen Brut- und Schlafplätze aufsuchen.', 'Die Klicklaute werden wie die anderen Lautäußerungen der Vögel von der Syrinx (Stimmkopf) erzeugt und umfassen einen großen Frequenzbereich, die maximale Intensität liegt zwischen 2 und 8 Kilohertz.

Kulturell, wirtschaftlich und auch familiär bestehen enge Verbindungen zwischen Oe-Cusse Ambeno und dem restlichen Westtimor. An der Küste Oe-Cusse Ambenos landeten 1515 die Portugiesen als erste Europäer auf der Insel Timor. Hier gründeten sie mit Lifau ihre erste Hauptstadt der Kolonie. Die Topasse, eine europäisch-malaiische Mischbevölkerung aus Flores und Solor, bauten in den namensgebenden Reichen \\"Oecusse\\" und \\"Ambeno\\" ihre Machtbasis aus. Sie kontrollierten lange Zeit den profitablen Sandelholz- und Bienenwachshandel und vertrieben 1769 sogar die Portugiesen nach Dili. Später kehrte das Gebiet der beiden Reiche wieder unter die portugiesische Oberhoheit zurück und blieb es auch, nachdem die Niederländer das umgebende Land ihrer Kolonie Niederländisch-Indien einverleibt hatten. Das später daraus entstandene Indonesien besetzte 1975 die Exklave als erstes Gebiet Portugiesisch-Timors, bevor einige Monate später die große Invasion in das restliche Osttimor begann. Das vom Guerillakrieg der osttimoresischen Unabhängigkeitsbewegung weitgehend verschonte Gebiet zerstörten indonesische Armee und pro-indonesische Milizen infolge des Unabhängigkeitsreferendums Osttimors 1999. Nach drei Jahren UN-Verwaltung wurde Osttimor unabhängig und Oe-Cusse Ambeno seine westlichste Provinz.', 'Oe-Cusse Ambeno wird in der Verfassung von Osttimor ein administrativer und wirtschaftlicher Sonderstatus zugestanden. 2014 wurde zur Umsetzung des Sonderstatus die Behörde der Sonderverwaltungsregion Oe-Cusse Ambeno (, ARAEO) geschaffen. Außerdem wurde eine \\"Sonderzone für soziale Marktwirtschaft\\" (, ZEESM) eingerichtet, der auch die Insel Atauro angehört.', 'Name.', 'Wie in Osttimor nicht ungewöhnlich, gibt es zahlreiche unterschiedliche Schreibweisen für den Namen der Region: \\"Oe-Kusi, Oecusse, Ocussi, Oecússi, Oecussi, Oekussi, Oekusi, Okusi, Oé-Cusse\\". Die Schreibweisen mit „k“ leiten sich meist von Tetum oder anderen austronesischen Sprachen ab. Mit „c“ sind Schreibweisen, die sich am Portugiesischen orientieren. Inzwischen wird wieder im offiziellen Gebrauch der Doppelname \\"Oecusse-Ambeno\\" (auch \\"Oecussi-Ambeno, Ocussi-Ambeno, Oecússi-Ambeno, Oe-Kusi Ambenu\\") verwendet, statt Oecusse allein. Selten wird die Exklave, wie in der indonesischen Besatzungszeit, nur \\"Ambeno\\" \\"(Ambenu)\\" genannt.', 'Das historische timoresische Reich, das den Großteil des Territoriums der heutigen Sonderverwaltungsregion einnahm, hieß Ambeno und hatte seine Zentren in Tulaica und Nunuhenu. Oecusse ist der traditionelle Name der heutigen Hauptstadt Pante Macassar und ihrer Umgebung. Hier lag das zweite traditionelle Reich der Exklave mit Sitz in Oesono.', '„Oecusse“ und „Ambeno“ wurden schon in der portugiesischen Kolonialzeit als Synonyme für die Exklave verwendet. Später kam der Doppelname Oecusse-Ambeno auf. In der offiziellen Auflistung aller Verwaltungseinheiten Osttimors von 2009 wird der damalige Distrikt aber nur mit seinem Kurznamen „Oecusse“ bezeichnet. Eine reale politische Teilung der Sonderverwaltungsregion entlang der Grenzen der alten Reiche gibt es nicht. „Oe-Cusse Ambeno“ ist wieder offiziell im Ministerialen Diplom 16/2017 angegeben.', 'Der Name „Oe-Kussi“ stammt aus dem lokalen Baikeno-Dialekt. „Oe“ bedeutet „Wasser“. Für „Kussi“ gibt es unterschiedliche Deutungen. Häufig wird es mit dem Namen einer bestimmten Art von traditionellen Tonkrügen gleichgesetzt, womit „Oe-Kussi“ in etwa „Wasserkrug“ bedeuten würde. Zu dieser Namensgebung gibt es eine Legende, um einen steinernen „Kussi“ im Suco Banafi. Andere Quellen geben an, dass \\"Kussi\\" ein einheimischer Herrscher von Ambeno war. Auch „Ambenu“ besteht aus zwei Wörtern. „Ama“ oder „am“ bedeutet „Vater“, beziehungsweise „König“. „Benu“ ist der Name zweier legendärer Herrscher der Region.', 'Geographie.', 'Übersicht.', 'Oe-Cusse Ambeno hat eine Fläche von 813,62 km². Die Sonderverwaltungsregion ist außer im Norden, wo sie an die Sawusee grenzt, vollständig von indonesischem Staatsgebiet umgeben. Das restliche Territorium von Osttimor liegt 58 Kilometer Luftlinie weiter östlich; auf der Straße beträgt die Distanz über 70 Kilometer. Die Küstenlinie Oecusses ist etwa 50 km lang, die Landgrenze etwa 300 km. Im Osten und Süden liegt der indonesische Regierungsbezirk Nordzentraltimor. Im äußersten Westen reicht Oe-Cusse Ambeno bis an den Regierungsbezirk Kupang. Bis 2019 stritten sich Osttimor und Indonesien um die \\"Área Cruz\\" (Verwaltungsamt Passabe), bis man sich auf die Zugehörigkeit zu Osttimor einigte. Weiterhin umstritten sind das 1069 Hektar große \\"Citrana-Dreieck\\" mit dem Ort Naktuka (Verwaltungsamt Nitibe) und die Insel Fatu Sinai, 12 km vor der Küste des westlichsten Punkts der Sonderverwaltungsregion. Von Oe-Cusse Ambeno aus führen Grenzübergänge bei Bobometo (Verwaltungsamt Oesilo), Sacato (Verwaltungsamt Pante Macassar) und Passabe (Verwaltungsamt Passabe) nach Westtimor. Allerdings sind nur Bobometo und Sacato legale Übergänge.', 'Oe-Cusse Ambeno ist in vier Verwaltungsämter \\"(Posto Administrativo)\\" mit insgesamt 18 Sucos und 63 Aldeias unterteilt. Die Verwaltungsämter sind Nitibe, Oesilo, Pante Macassar und Passabe. Die Hauptstadt Pante Macassar \\"(Pante Makasar, Oecussi)\\" befindet sich in dem als urban klassifizierten Suco Costa und liegt 281 km westlich von Dili.', 'Der wichtigste Fluss ist der Tono. Er entspringt im Verwaltungsamt Oesilo und mündet bei Lifau in die Sawusee. Außerhalb der Regenzeit fällt der Fluss aber trocken. Abseits des Tonos besteht die Sonderverwaltungsregion aus einer Landschaft mit wasserarmen Hügeln von 800 bis Höhe. Der Nordosten Oe-Cusse Ambenos bildet die jüngste und wildeste Oberflächenstruktur der gesamten Insel und ist vulkanischen Ursprungs.

In Oesilo befinden sich südlich des Ortes Saben (Suco Bobometo) die Schlammvulkane von Poto.', 'Geologie.', 'Regionalgeologisch befindet sich die Insel Timor im Bereich des Äußeren Bandabogens. Der Bandabogen \\"(Banda arc)\\" entstand bei der Kollision der Australischen mit der Eurasischen Platte. Dabei wurden seit dem späten Miozän distale (landferne) Sedimente des australischen Kontinentalrandes südwärts auf proximale (landnahe) Gesteinskomplexe überschoben. Einzelne Gesteinsblöcke aus dem Untergrund werden im Zuge der Subduktionsvorgänge an bestehende Inselbogengesteine angegliedert (aggregiert). Der komplexe Falten- und Überschiebungsgürtel entwickelt sich bis zum gegenwärtigen Zeitpunkt stetig weiter, da sich die Australische Platte durchschnittlich mit 70 Millimetern pro Jahr nordwärts unter die Eurasische Platte schiebt. Ausdruck dieser plattentektonischen Prozesse sind zahlreiche Erdbeben in dieser Region. Tektonostratigrafisch lassen sich in Oe-Cusse Ambeno drei Einheiten untergliedern.', 'Die älteste Einheit, die genetisch dem australischen Kontinentalrand \\"(Australian continental margin unit)\\" zugeordnet werden kann, wird in Oe-Cusse Ambeno im Süden des Sucos Naimeco durch die triassische \\"Aitutu-Formation\\" gebildet. Die hell- bis dunkelgraue, karbonatisch – tonige Wechselfolge ist durch fein- bis grobgeschichtete Gesteine charakterisiert, in die zahlreiche Karbonat- und Chert-Knollen sowie zahlreiche Fossilien eingelagert sind. Das harte radiolaritische Calcilutit, das 80 % der Formation ausmacht, bildet schroffe Klippen, auf denen nur eine spärliche Vegetation wächst. 15 % des Gesteins der Aitutu-Formation besteht aus Fossilschalen und 5 % werden durch Calcarenite, Schillkalksteine, Quarzarenite, Radiolarite und stark bitumenhaltige Gesteine gebildet.', 'Im Osten von Nitibe sind in einigen Gebieten Kalksteine der \\"Dartollu-Formation\\" aufgeschlossen, die sich im Eozän in seichten Meeresgewässern des australischen Kontinentalhanges gebildet haben. Die meist honigbraunen Biocalcarenite werden aus einer Mischung aus körnigen, kalkhaltigen Skelettfragmenten in einer Matrix aus Mikrit gebildet. Diese Gesteinsformation ist durch das Auftreten von zahlreichen Höhlensystemen gekennzeichnet, die auf eine intensive Verkarstung zurückgehen.', 'Ein Großteil Oe-Cusse Ambenos besteht aus Gesteinen des sogenannten \\"Bobonaro-Komplexes.\\" Diese Gesteine entstanden im Ergebnis der Kollision der beiden Kontinentalplatten. Diese allochthone Gesteinsformation kommt nicht nur in der nächstgelegenen osttimoresischen Gemeinde Bobonaro vor, sondern ist eine der häufigsten Gesteinsformationen der gesamten Insel. Eingebettet in eine Matrix aus Tonstein sind chaotisch eingelagerte, lithologisch äußerst unterschiedliche, kantige bis abgerundete Felsbrocken aus älteren geologischen Formationen (Perm bis unteres Miozän), die am australischen Kontinentalhang gebildet wurden. Während die vorwiegend dunkle, braune und grüne Tonmatrix die Sedimentation im Becken während der Bildung präsentiert, wurden die Gesteinsbrocken, vom Kontinentalhang durch submarine Erdbeben ausgelöst, in die weiche Tonmatrix eingelagert. Verschiedene Gesteinstypen können dabei sehr unregelmäßig in der Tonmatrix verteilt sein. Derartige Bildungen werden genetisch als Olisthostrome bezeichnet. Heftige Bodenbewegungen und tektonische Unruhe während der Bildung der Olisthostrome ab dem späten Miozän werden durch eine intensive Verschuppung der Gesteine und die Ausbildung von zahlreichen Harnischstriemen auf den eingebetteten Felsbrocken (Olistholithe) angezeigt. Die wesentlich härteren Olistholithe bilden dabei mehr als 90 % der Felsen der Region aus.

Nun erwirbt er von diesem einen kleinen Hof, der als verflucht gilt, um fortan Schafe zu züchten. Als Bjartur den Hof erwirbt, ist dieser bekannt als \\"Veturhus\\", Winterhäuser. Bjartur benennt ihn um: „Ich heiße Bjartur. Deswegen soll der Hof Sumarhus, Sommerhäuser, heißen.“ Er zieht frisch verheiratet mit Rosa ein, die zwei Jahre als Magd für denselben Großbauern wie Bjartur gearbeitet hat. Nichts ist ihm wichtiger als seine Unabhängigkeit: „Leute, die nicht unabhängig sind, sind keine Leute.“ Bjartur möchte seinen Hof in völliger Selbständigkeit betreiben, niemandem etwas schuldig sein und unter keinen Umständen Hilfe annehmen. Zur Untermauerung seiner Ansichten zitiert er gerne aus Sagas und Rímur, auch ist er selbst dichterisch veranlagt.', 'Bald stellt sich heraus, dass Rosa schwanger ist – offenbar von Ingolfur Arnarson Jonsson, dem Sohn des Großbauern und Gemeindeverwalters von Utiraudsmyri. Bjartur hatte Rosa schon kurz nach dem Einzug auf dem Hof vorgeworfen, sich mit Ingolfur Arnarson abgegeben zu haben, benimmt sich nun aber so, als sei die Schwangerschaft eine „Herzkrankheit“. Die schwangere Rosa sehnt sich nach einem besseren Leben und vor allem auch besserer Nahrung, als ihr der sparsame Bjartur („Unabhängigkeit ist besser als Fleisch“) zu bieten bereit ist. Als er im Herbst zum Zusammentreiben der Schafe in die Berge reitet, lässt Bjartur Rosa mit einem jungen Schaf als „Gesellschaft“ zurück. Nachts vom Blöken des Schafes wach gehalten, erscheint ihr dieses zunehmend unheimlicher, geisterhafter, bis sie es schließlich – fast von Sinnen – tötet. Anderntags bereitet Rosa sich aus dem geschlachteten Schaf ein Festmahl zu und versteckt die Reste vor Bjartur. Sie gibt vor, das Schaf sei fortgelaufen. Bjartur, der von der Herrlichkeit seines Schafes schwärmt, macht sich Mitte November bei schlechtem Wetter auf, nach diesem zu suchen, und lässt Rosa mit seiner Hündin zurück auf Sumarhus. Beim Versuch, einen Rentierbullen zu fangen, auf den er bei der Schafsuche trifft, wird Bjartur auf dessen Rücken über den reißenden Fluss Jökulsa getragen und gezwungen, zur Heimkehr einen tagelangen Umweg zu laufen. Als er, fast in Schneestürmen erfroren, wieder in Sumarhus ankommt, ist Rosa im Kindbett gestorben; die neugeborene Tochter aber lebt, gewärmt von Bjarturs Hündin.', 'Bjartur sieht sich gezwungen, das Vorgefallene auf Utiraudsmyri zu berichten. Es dauert jedoch eine ganze Weile, bis ihm die Frau des Verwalters entlocken kann, was eigentlich passiert ist. Sobald sie erfährt, dass Rosas Tochter noch am Leben ist, schickt sie eine Hebamme nach Sumarhus, die das Kind aufpäppelt. Bjartur gibt ihm den Namen Asta Sollilja (etwa „Geliebte Sonnen-Lilie“). Durch Vermittlung des Pfarrers findet Bjartur schon bald wieder eine Frau und heiratet Finna, die zusammen mit ihrer verwitweten Mutter Hallbera in Sumarhus einzieht.', 'Schuldenfreie Wirtschaft.', 'Bjartur lebt nun mit seiner Familie seit dreizehn Jahren auf Sumarhus. Diese ist um die drei Söhne Helgi, Gudmundur (genannt Gvendur) und Jon (genannt Nonni) angewachsen. Vier weitere Kinder sind jung gestorben. Während Bjarturs Frau Finna von Krankheiten geplagt wird, hält sich die zähe Großmutter Hallbera gut. Eines Tages drängt der Gemeindevorsteher der Familie eine Kuh auf – sehr zur Freude aller mit Ausnahme von Bjartur, zumal die Sendboten des Gemeindevorstehers kein Geld für die Kuh wollen. Der wütende Bjartur nimmt die Kuh schließlich an, besteht aber darauf, für sie zu bezahlen, und schickt die widerstrebenden Boten mit dem Geld zum Gemeindevorsteher. Dieser erscheint später auf dem Hof, um das Geld zurückzuzahlen, da der Frauenverein die Kuh bezahlt habe. Bjartur nimmt es nicht an. Dank der nun mit Kuhmilch ergänzten Ernährung verbessert sich der Gesundheitszustand und die Stimmung der Familie erheblich. Bjartur selbst hält jedoch nach wie vor nichts von der Kuh und fürchtet um das Heu seiner Schafe.', 'Die heranwachsende Asta Solillja liebt den Mann, den sie als ihren Vater ansieht, von Herzen. Er selbst bezeichnet sie als seine „Lebensblume.“ Diese Nähe zwischen Asta und Bjartur nimmt gefährliche Züge an, als sie nach Einkäufen in der Siedlung \\"Fjord\\" zusammen in einem Wirtshaus im selben Bett übernachten. Als sich Asta an Bjartur anschmiegt, scheint dieser ihre Annäherung zunächst zu erwidern, steigt dann aber plötzlich aus dem Bett und verlässt den Raum. Asta nimmt dies als brüskierende Zurückweisung wahr und folgt Bjartur; sie reisen sofort zurück nach Sumarhus.', 'Eines Tages taucht ein „Gast“ auf Sumarhus auf. Er ist ein Städter aus Reykjavík, der mit Bjarturs Zustimmung auf seinem Land campiert. Er vertreibt sich die Zeit mit Angeln und der Vogeljagd. Bjartur sieht es nicht gerne, dass er auch frische Süßwasserfische und Vögel auf Sumarhus vorbeibringt, denn beides ist nach Bjarturs Ansicht keine geeignete Nahrung, und er wirft seiner Familie vor, „mit Freuden Nahrungsmittel von Fremden“ anzunehmen und sich dafür „wie Bettler“ zu bedanken. Im nächsten Frühling hält sich Audur, die Schwester von Ingolfur Arnarson Jonsson, auf der Durchreise nach Reykjavík auf Sumarhus auf, wobei sich herausstellt, dass sie vom „Gast“ schwanger ist.', 'Der Frühling geht mit außerordentlich schlechtem Wetter und Schneestürmen einher. Bjartur verliert zahlreiche Schafe an den „Drehwurm“ und andere Krankheiten. Das Heu wird knapp; auch die Kuh magert ab und gibt kaum mehr Milch. Bjartur weigert sich, in die Gemeinde zu fahren, um Heu zu besorgen: „Ich möchte keinem unten in der Gemeinde etwas schulden. Wir sind unabhängige Leute. Ich bin auf niemanden angewiesen.“ Als Bjartur schließlich beschließt, die Kuh zu schlachten, und das auch in die Tat umsetzt, ist dies für die kranke Finna der letzte, vernichtende Schlag. „Wie armseliger Staub“ sinkt sie in den Schoß ihrer Mutter und stirbt wenig später.', 'Schwere Zeiten.', 'Dieser Teil beginnt mit einem Dialog zwischen dem ältesten und dem jüngsten von Bjarturs drei überlebenden Söhnen, Helgi und Nonni. Sie unterhalten sich über die Länge von Beerdigungen und darüber, ob es andere Länder wirklich gebe. Helgi behauptet, den geisterhaften Unhold sehen zu können, der den Hof immer wieder zerstört hat, und hält sich selbst für einen wandelnden Toten.', 'In der Adventszeit sind zwei von Bjarturs Schafen unter merkwürdigen Umständen umgekommen. Ein Mutterschaf findet er in eine Leiter gezwängt vor, mit gebrochenem Rückgrat, und ein Lamm wurde mit einer Schlinge erhängt. Im Schnee um das Haus finden sich jedoch keine Spuren. Bjartur, der jedem Aberglauben abhold ist, weiß nicht recht, ob er doch mit Gespenstern zu rechnen hat. Eines Morgens liegen sogar zehn Mutterschafe tot oder verendend auf dem Boden, auf unterschiedliche Weise brutal umgebracht. Nachdem Helgi Bjartur von seinen Geistersichtungen in Kenntnis gesetzt hat, begibt sich Bjartur zu einer Stelle, wo seit alters her Steine aufgeschichtet werden, um die umgehenden Geister zu besänftigen – Bjartur jedoch fällt es nicht ein, auch wenn er nun an Gespenster glauben mag, diesen irgendwie entgegenzukommen. Trotzig hält er einen Stein in die Höhe: „Hier stehe ich, Bjartur in Sumarhus, ein freier Mann im Lande, ein selbständiger Isländer von der Landnahmezeit bis zum heutigen Tag. Ihr könnt den Berg über mich stürzen. Doch einen Stein gebe ich euch nie.“ Als der angebliche Spuk auf Sumarhus in der Gemeinde bekannt wird, stellt sich ein Strom neugieriger Besucher auf dem Hof ein. Helgi und Nonni behaupten, mit dem Gespenst in Kontakt zu stehen. Bjartur aber meidet seine Besucher, die sich zusammen mit dem Pfarrer in seine Stube setzen und in ein eifriges Gespräch über die Existenz einer unsterblichen Seele geraten – bis sie von Bjartur grob verscheucht werden.', 'Obschon der „Spuk“ vorerst beendet scheint, sucht Bjartur nun doch auch nach weltlicher Hilfe und ruft „die Justiz“ in der Form des Gemeindevorstehers, der die Sache untersuchen soll. Während der Gemeindevorsteher auf Sumarhus schläft, verschwindet Helgi vom Hof. Seine Spuren verlieren sich im Schnee. Das Weihnachtsfest verbringt die Familie in bedrückter Stimmung, mit Ausnahme von Bjartur, denn dieser „dachte nie an etwas, das er verloren hatte, sofern er dessen ganz sicher war, daß er es verloren hatte“. Nach Weihnachten fährt Bjartur weg und kündigt an, erst zu Ostern zurückkehren zu wollen. Da er viel Vieh verloren hat, will er in Fjord nach Arbeit suchen: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"1.

Jahrhundert)', 'Mann', 'Schotte', 'Verleger (17. Jahrhundert)', 'Übersetzer von Homer'], 'John Ogilby (* November 1600 in oder bei Edinburgh; † 4. September 1676 in London) war ein schottischer Tänzer, Tanzmeister, Impresario, Übersetzer klassischer Epen und Fabeln, Dichter, Buchhändler, Verleger, sowie königlicher Zeremonienmeister, Buchdrucker und Kosmograph.', 'Ogilbys frühe Karriere als Tänzer endete bereits 1621, als er einen Unfall erlitt und von diesem Zeitpunkt an auf einem Bein lahm war. Danach kam Ogilby nach Irland, wo ihn der englische Statthalter Thomas Wentworth als Tanzmeister und Schreiber engagierte. Er gründete mit dem Werburgh Street Theatre Dublins erstes Theater und war von 1638 an als \\"Master of the Revels\\" für die Vergabe von Lizenzen für Masques und Theateraufführungen in Irland zuständig.', 'Nach Ausbruch des Bürgerkriegs in England 1641 wurde sein Gönner Wentworth auf dem Schafott hingerichtet und das Schauspielhaus in Dublin geschlossen. Daraufhin kehrte Ogilby nach England zurück, lernte Latein und Griechisch und übersetzte Vergil, Äsop und Homer ins Englische. Mit den \\"Aesopicks\\", einer auf den Fabeln Äsops basierenden und durch eigene Geschichten erweiterten satirischen Verserzählung, kritisierte Ogilby die politischen und gesellschaftlichen Zustände in England.', 'Seine Werke ließ Ogilby von Künstlern wie Wenzel Hollar oder Francis Cleyn illustrieren. Durch ästhetisch aufwendig gestaltete Ausgaben erwarb er sich ein Renommee, das ihm unter anderem den Auftrag verschaffte, den Krönungsfestzug Karls II. durch die Londoner City im Jahr 1661 in einem Prachtband zu dokumentieren \\"(The Entertainment of … Charles II)\\". Als Verleger gehörte Ogilby zu den Pionieren der Subskription im englischen Verlagsgeschäft des 17. Jahrhunderts.', 'Im Jahr 1671 gründete Ogilby eine eigene Druckerei und konzentrierte sich auf die Herausgabe geographischer Werke. Am bekanntesten wurde der 1675 veröffentlichte Atlas \\"Britannia\\". Mit seiner spezifischen Art der Darstellung bestimmte Ogilbys \\"Britannia\\" Straßenpläne bis weit ins 18. Jahrhundert und gilt heute als Meilenstein in der Entwicklung von Straßenatlanten.', 'Leben und Werk.', 'Herkunft und Jugend.', 'Auf seinen Geburtsort angesprochen, gab Ogilby in späteren Jahren an, er wolle ihn nicht offenlegen, damit – wie im Falle Homers – mehrere Orte das Recht für sich beanspruchen könnten, ihn ihren Sohn zu nennen. Allgemein wird angenommen, dass Ogilby in oder nahe bei Edinburgh geboren wurde. Allerdings weisen die Taufregister von Edinburgh laut Katherine Van Eerde, der maßgeblichen Biographin Ogilbys, für die Jahre um 1600 keinen Ogilby aus.', 'Ein von Ogilbys Freund Elias Ashmole erstelltes Horoskop (Abbildung) enthält in der Mitte die Angabe', 'Folgt man Ashmole, so wurde Ogilby also in einem Ort namens ‚Kellemeane‘ zehn Meilen nördlich von Dundee geboren. Während Ogilbys Biographin Van Eerde diesen Ort nicht identifizieren konnte, nimmt Margret Schuchard an, dass es sich dabei um den kleinen Ort Kirriemuir handelt.', 'Ogilby hat nur wenige Jahre seiner Jugend in Schottland verbracht. Van Eerde vermutet, dass die Familie bald, nachdem Jakob VI. von Schottland 1603 als Jakob I. den englischen Thron bestiegen hatte, nach London übergesiedelt ist. Im Jahr 1606 erwarb Ogilbys Vater das Londoner Bürgerrecht und gleichzeitig die Mitgliedschaft in der im 14. Jahrhundert gegründeten \\"Merchant Taylors’ Company\\", eine der Livery Companies der City of London. Laut John Aubreys Kurzbiographie in seinem Werk Brief Lives verschwendete Ogilbys Vater sein Vermögen und wurde 1612 aufgrund seiner Schulden im \\"King’s Bench Prison\\" inhaftiert. Durch einen Lotteriegewinn gelang es dem gerade zwölfjährigen John Ogilby noch im selben Jahr, die Gläubiger seines Vaters auszuzahlen und ihn damit aus dem Schuldgefängnis freizukaufen.', 'Tanzmeister.', 'Kurz nach der Freilassung seines Vaters begann Ogilby eine Tanzausbildung bei John Draper in der Londoner \\"Gray’s Inn Lane\\". Van Eerde vermutet, dass sich Ogilbys Familie auch nach der Freilassung des Vaters in einer finanziell schwierigen Lage befand und der junge Ogilby sich deshalb zu einer Ausbildung als Tanzmeister entschloss.', 'Es spricht einiges dafür, dass Ogilby beim Tanzen eine ausgesprochene Begabung bewies. Er absolvierte seine Lehrzeit in fünf Jahren und damit in kürzerer Zeit als den vorgeschriebenen sieben. Anschließend gründete er seine eigene Tanzschule. Bald darauf wurde der Herzog von Buckingham auf ihn aufmerksam und engagierte ihn für ein Maskenspiel zu Ehren Jakobs I.', 'Der Herzog von Buckingham war für die Ausrichtung prunkvoller Maskenspiele bekannt. Den Text für die Aufführung im Jahr 1621 gab Buckingham bei dem Bühnenautor Ben Jonson in Auftrag, den Jakob I. seit Jahren als Maskenspielautor schätzte. Aufgeführt wurde das Stück \\"Die verwandelten Zigeuner\\" (engl. \\"The Gypsies Metamorphosed\\") auf Buckinghams festlich hergerichtetem Landsitz Burley-on-the-Hill. Buckingham und seine Höflinge schlüpften in die Rolle von Zigeunern, lasen den zuschauenden Mitgliedern des Hofes aus der Hand und sagten schließlich auch dem alternden König eine schmeichelhafte Zukunft voraus. Dieser war begeistert und bat darum, das Stück noch zweimal sehen zu können. Bei einer dieser Aufführungen fand John Ogilbys Tanzkarriere ein jähes Ende. Er zog sich eine Bänder- oder Knorpelverletzung im Knie zu und lahmte für den Rest seines Lebens auf einem Bein.', 'Auch nach seinem Unfall blieb Ogilby dem Tanzen treu, allerdings in gewandelter Rolle: In den 1620er und 30er Jahren arbeitete er als Tanzlehrer auf dem Gut des Landedelmanns Robert Hopton in Witham, Somerset, und knüpfte weitere Beziehungen zu Personen am Hofe. Vermutlich mit Hilfe dieser Beziehungen erhielt er 1633 eine Anstellung bei Sir Thomas Wentworth. Einen Monat, nachdem Wentworth vom König zum Statthalter von Irland ernannt worden war, folgte Ogilby ihm nach Dublin und unterrichtete Wentworths Kinder sowie Wentworths junge und gesellschaftlich unerfahrene Frau.', 'Schauspieldirektor.', 'Als Statthalter von Irland kümmerte Wentworth sich nicht allein um die Verwaltung des Landes, er schuf auch seinen eigenen Hof nach dem Vorbild des Königshofes in London. Zu einem solchen gehörte auch ein Theater, und so erhielt Ogilby die Befugnis, das erste Theater Irlands zu errichten.', 'Unter Ogilbys Aufsicht entstand das Werburgh Street Theatre in direkter Nähe von Dublin Castle. Die größte Herausforderung hierbei war, gute Schauspieler und Musiker in das ferngelegene Dublin zu locken. Dabei kam Ogilby der Zufall zu Hilfe: Aufgrund einer schweren Seuche mussten alle Londoner Theater zwischen Mai 1636 und Oktober 1637 schließen, und so konnte Ogilby, der ausgezeichnete Beziehungen zur Theaterwelt in London besaß, zahlreiche renommierte Künstler für sein Theater in Dublin engagieren.', 'Einige der während dieser Zeit aufgeführten Stücke stammten aus der Feder von bekannten Bühnenautoren wie Thomas Middleton, John Fletcher und Ben Jonson. Chefdramaturg des Theaters in der Werburgh Street war aber James Shirley. Shirley führte eine Reihe seiner älteren Stücke erneut auf und schrieb während seiner Zeit in Dublin mindestens drei neue (\\"Rosania\\", \\"The Royal Master\\" und \\"St. Patrick for Ireland\\"), die im Werburgh Street Theatre uraufgeführt wurden. Mit \\"The Merchant of Dublin\\" schrieb auch Ogilby ein neues Stück, das zwar aufgeführt, aber nie gedruckt wurde.', 'Im Jahr 1638 berief Wentworth Ogilby zum \\"Master of the Revels\\" für Irland; als solcher war Ogilby für die Vergabe von Lizenzen für Maskenspiele und Theateraufführungen zuständig. Ohne diese Lizenzen war keine Form der öffentlichen Unterhaltung erlaubt, und die Lizenzgebühren flossen in Ogilbys Taschen.', 'Übersetzer und Dichter.', 'Im Jahr 1641 fand Ogilbys Aufstieg ein jähes Ende. Im Mai wurde sein Gönner Wentworth nach kurzem Prozess wegen Hochverrats im Tower von London hingerichtet. Nur wenige Monate später brach der Aufstand der katholischen Iren in Dublin aus, und Irland versank im Bürgerkrieg. Aus Ogilbys Werburgh Street Theatre wurde im Laufe der Kriegswirren ein Pferdestall der städtischen Miliz.', 'Irgendwann in den 1640er Jahren verließ Ogilby Irland und kehrte nach England zurück. Zunächst ging er nach Cambridge, wo er an der Schule seines Freundes James Shirley Latein- und Griechischunterricht nahm. Für das Jahr 1648 ist sein Aufenthalt in London belegt. Wovon er dort zunächst seinen Lebensunterhalt bestritt, ist nicht bekannt.', 'Im März 1650 heiratete er Christian Hunsdon, die wohlhabende Witwe von Thomas Hunsdon, einem Mitglied der Londoner \\"Merchant Taylors’ Company\\". Christian Hunsdon war vermutlich nur wenige Jahre jünger als ihr zum damaligen Zeitpunkt fünfzigjähriger Ehegatte. Sie hatte drei Kinder aus erster Ehe, und es wird allgemein angenommen, dass sie ein Vermögen in die Ehe mitbrachte, das der gerade aus Irland geflüchtete Ogilby dringend für seine Tätigkeit als Übersetzer und Schriftsteller benötigte.', 'Vergil.', 'Ogilbys Tätigkeit als Übersetzer begann schon vor seiner Heirat. Im Jahr 1649 erschien bei John Crook eine Ausgabe der Werke des römischen Dichters Vergil. Crook war auch James Shirleys Verleger, und es ist zu vermuten, dass Ogilby und Crook sich aus ihrer gemeinsamen Zeit in Irland kannten.', 'Vergils Werke waren, beginnend mit William Caxtons Übersetzung im späten 15. Jahrhundert, schon mehrfach ins Englische übertragen worden. Während seine Vorgänger recht frei mit dem Text verfuhren, zielte Ogilby auf eine möglichst wortgetreue Übertragung ab. Sein Ziel war es, Vergils „römische Muse in heimische englische Wolle zu kleiden“.', 'Ogilbys Vergil-Ausgabe von 1649 ist mit einem ausführlichen Kommentar versehen. Drei Viertel dieses Kommentars schrieb Ogilby aus dem lateinischen Vergilkommentar des spanischen Jesuiten und Humanisten Juan Luis de la Cerda \\"(Commentaria in omnia opera Publii Virgilii Maronis)\\" ab. Dieses Vorgehen war zu jener Zeit keinesfalls unüblich – je besser Argumente durch illustre Autoritäten gestützt wurden, umso höher die Glaubwürdigkeit.', 'Van Eerde bewertet Ogilbys Text als „geradlinig“ und sein Versmaß aus jambischen Fünfhebern als „passabel“. Ogilbys Reime, so Van Eerde weiter, seien im Allgemeinen klingend, auch wenn sie bisweilen misslängen. Der einflussreiche englische Dramatiker John Dryden, der im Jahr 1697 selber eine Vergil-Ausgabe besorgte, stellt Ogilby auf eine Stufe mit Thomas Heywood und James Shirley und macht sich in seinem satirischen Werk \\"Mac Flecknoe\\" über die dichterischen Fähigkeiten seiner Vorgänger lustig.', ': Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"John Ogilby, Schotte, Kartograf, Übersetzer, Verleger, Tänzer, Theater, Vergil, Dublin, Britannia"},{"prompt":"Уважаемые исполнители, нужно написать статью или перевести или т.д что бы была уникальность текста 2000 букв без пробелов если будет возможность прикрепить картинку, направление строительство и ремонт, отделка с отголоском на компанию или словом ( ремонт квартир спб ) ключи можно увидеть на сайте Ремонт квартир Спб можно брать отдельно любую страницу и смотреть тайтл или дескрипшен .

B. die Bildung eines Nachkommen aus Selbstbefruchtung verhindern, etwa über Gene, die zum Tod von embryonalem Gewebe führen (\\"Letal-Allele\\") und andere Wirkungsweisen, sogar nach der Befruchtung. Ihre Einordnung als „Selbstinkompatibilitätssystem“ ist unter den Botanikern umstritten, da durchaus eine Selbstbefruchtung stattfindet, aber letztendlich keine Nachkommen daraus erzeugt werden.', 'Botanische und genetische Grundlagen.', 'Pflanzen bilden zwei Generationen aus. Die eine Generation, „Gametophyt“ genannt, trägt nur einen Satz an Chromosomen, was man auch als „haploid“ bezeichnet. Der Gametophyt bildet nun Geschlechtszellen, sogenannte „Gameten“ aus: männliche und weibliche. Diese verschmelzen zu einer Zygote, einen Vorgang, den man als „Befruchtung“ bezeichnet. Die Zygote besitzt nun den doppelten Chromosomensatz („diploid“) und bildet die nächste Generation aus. Diese nennt man „Sporophyt“ und diese ist es auch, die man allgemein als „Samenpflanze“, sprich als Baum oder „Blume“ vor Augen sieht. Der Gametophyt ist bei Samenpflanzen auf sehr wenige Zellen reduziert. Der weibliche Gametophyt befindet sich in der Samenanlage, die im Fruchtknoten liegt, der männliche Gametophyt im Inneren des Pollens. Das haploide Polleninnere keimt nach der Bestäubung schlauchförmig aus (daher auch „Pollenschlauch“ genannt) und befruchtet die ebenfalls haploide „Eizelle“ in der Samenanlage. Daraus entsteht wieder ein neuer diploider Sporophyt.', 'Die Befruchtung funktioniert bei Pflanzen im Prinzip genauso wie bei Tieren: Aus zwei einfachen Chromosomensätzen wird ein doppelter. Der Vorteil eines doppelten Chromosomensatzes ist, dass defekte Gene durch die ihnen entsprechenden Gene auf dem zweiten Chromosom ausgeglichen werden können. Das ist auch einer der Gründe dafür, warum die meisten höher entwickelten Lebewesen nicht haploid sind. Wenn ein diploider Organismus mit einem defekten Gen sich aber selbst befruchtet, kann es sein, dass die beiden defekten Genversionen aufeinander treffen. Das bedeutet, es ist kein Ausgleich mehr möglich und das kann Nachteile oder gar den Tod bedeuten. Selbstbefruchtung kann also negative Folgen haben und wird deswegen allgemein häufig verhindert.', 'Um eine Selbstbefruchtung bei Samenpflanzen zu verhindern, kann man versuchen, schon die Selbstbestäubung auszuschließen. Dies ist recht häufig realisiert, meist aber nicht besonders effektiv. Eine andere Methode wäre es, den „eigenen“ Pollen zu erkennen und ihn vom Befruchten abzuhalten. Dazu bedarf es dreier Dinge: Merkmale des Pollens, Merkmale der Narbe und einen Mechanismus, bei Pollen, der als unerwünscht erkannt ist, dessen Wachstum zu verhindern oder zu stoppen. Da man zu Beginn der Erforschung der Selbstinkompatibilitätssysteme die Genetik noch nicht vollständig verstanden hat, ging man davon aus, dass dies durch ein einziges Gen geschieht. Dieses bezeichnete man als „S-Gen“, wobei das S dabei für „Selbstinkompatibilität“ steht. Heutzutage ist jedoch bekannt, dass nur wenige sehr nahe beieinander liegende („gekoppelte“) Gene dafür zuständig sind. Korrekterweise müsste man daher von einem „S-Genlocus“ sprechen. Da jede Pflanze solche S-Genloci besitzt, müssen die Gene in verschiedenen Formen (so genannten „Allelen“) vorliegen, um eine Unterscheidung zwischen „selbst“ und „fremd“ zu gewährleisten. Das ist ganz analog zu einem Ausweis: Jeder besitzt einen, aber bei jedem sieht er etwas anders aus. Aus diesen verschiedenen Allelen entstehen Proteine mit meist kleinen, aber wichtigen Unterschieden, die zur (Selbst-)Erkennung notwendig sind. Die Anzahl der Allele liegt, je nach System bei 2 (HMSI) oder schwankt zwischen 20 und 70 (GSI und SSI).', 'Um eine wirkliche „Selbsterkennung“ zu gewährleisten, müssen das jeweilige Allel für das Pollencharakteristikum und das Allel für das zusammenpassende Narbenmerkmal stets gekoppelt vorliegen. Täten sie das nicht, so würden sich die Selbsterkennungsmerkmale im Lauf der Zeit unabhängig voneinander innerhalb einer Gruppe (Population) von Pflanzen verteilen (\\"siehe auch\\" ). Das liegt daran, dass es bei der Bildung von haploiden Keimzellen (genauer bei der Meiose) zum Austausch von genetischem Material zwischen den jeweils doppelt vorliegenden Chromosomen kommt (Rekombination). Je enger die Gene für die Merkmale zusammenliegen, desto unwahrscheinlicher ist ihre Trennung bei der Rekombination.', 'Welche Merkmale von Pollen beziehungsweise Narbe jeweils genau für die Erkennung verantwortlich sind und wie diese exakt funktioniert, hängt von den jeweiligen SI-Systemen ab. Das bedeutet auch, dass sie evolutionär nicht zwingend miteinander verwandt (homolog) sind. Da sie aber allesamt eine Selbststerilität bewirken, werden sie trotzdem mit dem Überbegriff „S-Gene“ zusammengefasst. Auf Grund der Verteilung der Inkompatibilitätssysteme innerhalb der Samenpflanzen wird davon ausgegangen, dass sie teils mehrfach unabhängig voneinander entstanden sind und dass auch innerhalb eines Systems parallele Entwicklungen stattgefunden haben.', 'Bei den Süßgräsern (Poaceae) ist neben dem S-Gen ein weiteres, analog funktionierendes Gen bekannt, das als „Z-Gen“ bezeichnet wird. Es müssen sowohl S-Allel als auch Z-Allel übereinstimmen, damit es zum Abbruch der Befruchtung kommt. Beim Scharfen Hahnenfuß (\\"Ranunculus acris\\") wurde ein drittes, bei der Zuckerrübe (\\"Beta vulgaris\\") sogar noch ein viertes Gen entdeckt. Allerdings wiesen Mulcahy &amp; Bergamini-Mulcahy 1983 darauf hin, dass durch mehrere unabhängige Selbstinkompatibilitätsgene eine Selbsterkennung immer unwahrscheinlicher wird.', 'Gametophytische Selbstinkompatibilität (GSI).', 'Bei der GSI erfolgt die Erkennungsreaktion durch den Genotyp des Gametophyten. Da der auskeimende Pollenschlauch gametophytisch ist und somit nur einen Satz an Chromosomen trägt (haploid), besitzt er nur ein S-Allel. Im Griffel der zu bestäubenden Blüte liegen zwei Allele vor, da er sporophytisch und somit diploid ist. Die beiden Allele werden dort meist gleichzeitig exprimiert (Kodominanz).', 'Die GSI besitzt durch die gametophytische Erkennung einen gewissen Nachteil, durch die eine Befruchtung mit genetisch ähnlichem Pollen möglich wird. Kreuzt z. B. ein männlicher Elter mit S1, S3 mit einem weiblichen Elter mit S1, S2, so können 50 % des Pollens (nämlich die S3-Pollen) die Eizelle befruchten. Da es bei der Meiose während der Gametophytenentwicklung zum Austausch von genetischem Material unter den Chromosomen kommt (Rekombination), können in der befruchteten Eizelle (Zygote) bei beiden Chromosomen identische (homozygote) Genbereiche auftreten. Dies kann bei defekten Genkopien zu negativen Effekten führen.', 'Die GSI ist häufig mit bestimmten Merkmalen korreliert. So ist der Pollen bei der Bestäubung häufig noch zweikernig. Der männliche Gametophyt besteht also aus der Pollenschlauchzelle und der generativen Zelle, die sich erst später in die beiden Spermazellen teilt. Die Schutzschicht auf der Narbenoberfläche (Cuticula) ist diskontinuierlich, besitzt also Lücken oder Dünnstellen. Durch diese sezerniert die Narbe eine zuckerreiche Flüssigkeit („feuchte Narbe“). Bei Süßgräsern existieren diese Korrelationen nicht, obwohl ihre Selbstinkompatibilität sonst über den Gametophyten erfolgt. So sind Gräserpollen dreikernig und die Narbenoberfläche ist stark behaart und sonst trocken.', 'Die GSI ist bei 56 Pflanzenfamilien bekannt.

Nachdem die russische Duma die Ratifizierung immer weiter verzögerte und da sich die U-Boote noch in gutem Zustand befanden, setzte 1999 ein Umdenken ein. Der Kongress der Vereinigten Staaten genehmigte Gelder zur Erstellung einer Konzeptstudie, die untersuchen sollte, ob sich aus den vier Booten Plattformen für den Abschuss von Marschflugkörpern machen ließen.

Ab 1998 ging die Navy dann offiziell davon aus, die Boote 42 Jahre in Dienst halten zu können, geteilt in zwei 20-jährige Einsatzfenster mit einer Überholung dazwischen. Diese Verlängerung konnte erreicht werden, da sich die Boote weit weniger schnell abnutzten als Jagd-U-Boote (SSN). Einer der Gründe hierfür ist der sehr viel „ruhigere“ Modus Operandi.

Während des Aufenthaltes in Horst vertiefte sich die Beziehung von Lovis Corinth und Charlotte Berend, und sie wurden ein Liebespaar. Berend beschrieb später in ihren Lebenserinnerungen \\"Mein Leben mit Lovis Corinth\\", wie sie beide engumschlungen auf einem Steg saßen und sie ihm die Geschichte ihres ersten Heiratsantrags erzählte. Das Bild \\"Selbstporträt mit Charlotte Berend und Sektkelch\\" entstand nach einem Kurzurlaub in Tutzing am Starnberger See, einem „vorgezogenen Honigmond“, und wurde von Corinth als Verlobungsbild betrachtet. Nach ihren Erinnerungen schilderte Charlotte Berend-Corinth die Entstehung wie folgt:', 'Laut eigenen Angaben heirateten Lovis Corinth und Charlotte Berend, die sich für den Doppelnamen Berend-Corinth entschied, im Folgejahr am 26. März 1903. Laut Charlottenburger Standesamt fand die Trauung erst im März 1904 statt – diese persönliche „Vorverlegung“ wird damit erklärt, dass der gemeinsame Sohn Thomas Corinth am 13. Oktober 1904 auf die Welt kam, die Braut also bei der Hochzeit schon schwanger war.', 'Einordnung in das künstlerische Werk.', 'Das Bild \\"Selbstporträt mit Charlotte Berend und Sektkelch\\" lässt sich auf vielfältige Weise in das Werk Lovis Corinths einordnen, wobei vor allem seine Funktion als Doppelporträt und zugleich als Selbstbildnis und Bildnis von Charlotte Berend, später Charlotte Berend-Corinth, im Vordergrund steht. Corinth hat zahlreiche Selbstporträts geschaffen, in der Regel malte er eines bei jedem seiner Geburtstage. Laut Carl Georg Heise hinterließ er 42 Gemälde mit Selbstbildnissen, dazu kommen zahlreiche Skizzen, Zeichnungen und graphische Blätter mit seinem Porträt. Von seiner Frau malte er etwa 80 Gemälde, bei denen er sie explizit darstellte – hinzu kommen zahlreiche weitere Bilder, bei denen sie ihm Modell stand, ohne dass dieses besonders herausgestellt wurde. Er stellte fest, dass Corinths Porträts besonders leidenschaftlich ausfielen, umso persönlicher sie für ihn wurden, und demnach sei es leicht verständlich nachzuvollziehen, „bei welchen Bildnis-Modellen Corinths künstlerisches Ingenium sich am leidenschaftlichsten entzündete: bei seiner eigenen Erscheinung und bei der seiner Nächsten.“', 'Corinth war, als er 1901 Charlotte Berend als seine Schülerin kennenlernte, bereits ein etablierter und gut ausgebildeter Maler, der durch seine Werke bereits Anerkennung vor allem in der Berliner Kunstszene um die Berliner Secession bekommen hatte. Er war zudem bereits vorher durch Selbstporträts und Aktdarstellungen aufgefallen, sodass diese Sujets für ihn kein Neuland waren. Andererseits stellte die Liaison mit Charlotte Berend einen Wendepunkt in seinem Leben dar, da er sich bis dahin nicht an eine Frau gebunden hatte. 1902 begann diese Beziehung, sodass Charlotte Berend ab diesem Jahr von ihm als Motiv und Modell in sein Werk aufgenommen wurde. Nach der Erinnerung von Charlotte Berend-Corinth fragte er sie 1901 zum Ende des Semesters zum ersten Mal, ob er ein Porträt von ihr malen dürfe. Er plante mit ihr das \\"Porträt Charlotte Berend im weißen Kleid\\", das er später signierte und ihr schenkte. Vorher malte er jedoch das Bild \\"Maske im weißen Kleid\\", da Berend mit ihrem Kleid auch einen schwarzen Seidenschal und eine schwarze Maske mitgebracht hatte.', 'Nach der Charakterisierung des Kunsthistorikers Alfred Kuhn, der seine Biografie 1925 nach dem Tod Corinths veröffentlichte, begann mit der Beziehung zu Charlotte Corinth „eine neue Epoche in des Malers Schaffen“ und „der schwere Mann, der ungeschlachte Riese ward zum Kinde, der Stier ging zahm und willig an der Leine, die ein junges Mädchen führte.“ Er bezog sich damit auf das Porträt \\"Mädchen mit Stier\\", das wie das \\"Petermannchen\\" auf ihrer ersten gemeinsamen Reise gemalt wurde. Dieses Bild, an dem Charlotte Berend einen kräftigen Stier am Nasenring führt und streichelt, fand aufgrund der darin enthaltenen Bedeutung besondere Aufmerksamkeit in der Berliner Sezession: Symbolisch zeigte es die aktuelle Beziehung des Paares auf, in der sich Corinth als gezähmten Bullen von der Frau an einem rosa Band am Nasenring herumführen ließ.', 'Deutung und Rezeption.', 'Bezugnahme auf Rembrandt.', 'Für das \\"Selbstporträt mit Charlotte Berend und Sektkelch\\" wählte Lovis Corinth ein Gemälde Rembrandts als Vorbild, was nach Beat Wyss „überdeutlich erkennbar“ ist. Sabine Fehlemann, ehemalige Direktorin des Von der Heydt-Museums in Wuppertal, erkennt zudem auch Peter Paul Rubens als Vorbild. Auf Rembrandts Selbstbildnis \\"Rembrandt und Saskia im Gleichnis vom verlorenen Sohn\\", das etwa 1635 entstand, porträtierte sich Rembrandt mit seiner Frau Saskia van Uylenburgh in einer Szene, bei der sie auf seinem Schoß sitzt und er dem Betrachter mit einem erhobenen Glas zuprostet, während seine Hand auf der Hüfte der Frau ruht. Rembrandt setzte das Bild in den Kontext einer Darstellung des biblischen Gleichnisses vom verlorenen Sohn aus dem Lukasevangelium (). Er stellt dabei den verlorenen Sohn dar, der sein Geld im Wirtshaus verprasst, Saskia wird in der Rolle einer Hure dargestellt. Corinth nutzt die Komposition und Farbgebung von Rembrandts Gemälde, anders als dieser stellte er sich und Charlotte Berend allerdings nicht in einem biblischen oder historisierenden Kontext dar, sondern als erotische und sehr intime Szene. Nach Gerhard Leistner entsprechen sich die beiden Bilder jedoch auch inhaltlich: „In beiden Bildern geht es um das Gleichnis vom verlorenen Sohn im Bordell“ mit dem Corinth „das öffentliche Wagnis [eingehe], im reaktionären Kaiserreich so schonungslos offen die sinnlich erfüllte Beziehung zwischen Mann und Frau vorzuführen“. Nach Wyss vertauscht Corinth allerdings die Rollen im Bild: „Drängt sich Rembrandt, als fröhlicher Haudegen verkleidet, in den Vordergrund, scheint Corinth ganz im Liebesglück, Wein- und Malergenuss versunken. Die schimmernde Haut Charlottes steht im Mittelpunkt: Die führt uns der Maler vor als wäre er König Kandaules, der seinen Freund Gyges hinter einem Vorhang sich zu verstecken hieß, von wo er dieses sein prächtiges Weib bewundern sollte.“', 'Nach Wyss hatte allerdings auch Rembrandt in seiner ersten Version des Bildes vom verlorenen Sohn eine unbekleidete Frau auf seinem Schoß dargestellt: „Neuere Untersuchungen haben festgestellt, dass das Gemälde stark beschnitten ist.

Zwischen 2002 und 2010 gewann er acht Medaillen bei Olympischen Winterspielen, darunter zwei goldene.', 'Ohno begann seine sportliche Karriere Mitte der 1990er-Jahre und errang 1997 im Alter von 14 Jahren seinen ersten von elf nationalen Meistertiteln. 2002 wurde er bei den Winterspielen in Salt Lake City Olympiasieger im 1500-Meter-Rennen, vier Jahre später gelang ihm in Turin über 500 Meter der gleiche Erfolg. Mehr als zehn Jahre lang gehörte Ohno der Shorttrack-Weltspitze an und gewann in dieser Zeit unter anderem dreimal den Mehrkampf-Gesamtweltcup sowie 2008 den Weltmeistertitel im Mehrkampf. Die letzten Wettkämpfe seiner Laufbahn bestritt er bei den Olympischen Winterspielen 2010 in Vancouver, wo er mit drei weiteren Medaillen zu einem der historisch erfolgreichsten US-amerikanischen Teilnehmer an Winterspielen wurde.', 'In den Vereinigten Staaten besaß Ohno auch dank verschiedener Fernsehauftritte – etwa einem Sieg in der Show \\"Dancing with the Stars\\" 2007 – große Beliebtheit und trug zur Popularisierung der Randsportart Shorttrack bei. Insbesondere in Südkorea wurde er hingegen vor allem wegen einer Kontroverse um seinen ersten Olympiasieg kritisch gesehen und zwischenzeitlich stark angefeindet. Nach seinem Karriereende arbeitete Ohno unter anderem als Kommentator für NBC und investierte in verschiedenen Geschäftsfeldern. 2019 wurde er in die United States Olympic &amp; Paralympic Hall of Fame aufgenommen.', 'Sportliche Laufbahn.', 'Anfänge.', 'Apolo Anton Ohno wuchs in Federal Way in der Metropolregion Seattle als Sohn des alleinerziehenden Friseurs Yuki Ohno auf, der in Seattle einen Salon betrieb. Sein Vater meldete ihn als Sechsjährigen zunächst in einem Schwimmclub an und nahm ihn wenig später zur Rollschuhbahn mit, wo Ohno mit dem Quad- und Inlineskaten anfing. Sowohl im Schwimmen als auch im Inlineskating feierte er als Kind Erfolge: Mit zwölf Jahren wurde er in seiner Altersklasse Meister des Staates Washington im Brustschwimmen und hielt nationale Inline-Rekorde. Die Übertragung der olympischen Shorttrack-Wettkämpfe 1994 weckte Ohnos Interesse an der Eislaufdisziplin. Gemeinsam mit seinem Vater reiste er in den folgenden Jahren für Trainings und Wettkämpfe unter anderem nach Eugene und Vancouver, wo er sich an den zur internationalen Spitze gehörenden kanadischen Shorttrackern orientierte. Mit 13 Jahren belegte Ohno im Januar 1996 den vierten Rang bei der nationalen Qualifikation für die Junioren-Weltmeisterschaft. Er stand dabei in direkter Konkurrenz zu Athleten, die bis zu fünf Jahre älter waren. Ohnos Leistungen – verbunden mit drängenden Nachfragen seines Vaters, der nach weiteren Fördermöglichkeiten für seinen Sohn suchte – überzeugten den für das US-Juniorenteam verantwortlichen Trainer Patrick Wentland, den Nachwuchsathleten am Lake Placid Olympic Center aufzunehmen, obwohl er das festgelegte Mindestalter von 15 Jahren noch nicht erreicht hatte. Im Sommer 1996 zog Ohno nach Lake Placid, um dort gemeinsam mit dem Junioren-Nationalkader zu trainieren.', 'Unter Wentlands Anleitung verbesserte Ohno seine Eislauftechnik und entschied im März 1997 mit 14 Jahren die US-Meisterschaften der Erwachsenen für sich. Er triumphierte vor dem mehrfachen Olympiateilnehmer Andrew Gabel und qualifizierte sich für den amerikanischen Nationalkader, der bei Jeroen Otter in Colorado Springs trainierte. Bei Ohnos erster WM-Teilnahme einen Monat nach dem nationalen Meistertitel verpasste er als 19. eine vordere Platzierung. Enttäuscht und von der Saison erschöpft legte Ohno im Sommer gegen Otters Rat eine halbjährige Trainingspause ein, die er in Seattle verbrachte und in der er deutlich an Gewicht zunahm. Im Januar 1998 platzierte er sich unter 16 Teilnehmern auf dem letzten Rang bei der nationalen Olympia-Ausscheidung und verpasste damit die Qualifikation für die Winterspiele in Nagano. Er baute sein Training in den Folgemonaten neu auf – zunächst am Juniorenstützpunkt in Lake Placid, dann wieder in Colorado Springs, wo mittlerweile Patrick Wentland die Betreuung des Nationalkaders übernommen hatte. Zudem arbeitete er mit einem Sportpsychologen zusammen. Im November 1998 gewann Ohno in Székesfehérvár über 1000 Meter vor dem amtierenden Olympiasieger auf dieser Strecke, dem Südkoreaner Kim Dong-sung, zum ersten Mal ein Rennen im Shorttrack-Weltcup. Zwei Monate später wurde er in Montreal als erster US-Amerikaner Shorttrack-Juniorenweltmeister.', 'Ab 1999 festigte Ohno stetig seine Position als führender US-amerikanischer Shorttracker. Er siegte regelmäßig bei nationalen Meisterschaften im Mehrkampf (bis 2009 insgesamt elf Mal) und stellte US-Rekorde über 500 Meter sowie 1500 Meter auf. Im Training löste sich Ohno Anfang der 2000er-Jahre für einige Zeit weitgehend vom Nationalteam und arbeitete mit anderen Trainern zusammen, weil er die Betreuung der neuen leitenden Trainerin Sue Ellis als wenig förderlich empfand. In seiner 2002 erschienenen Autobiographie schrieb er, Ellis habe vollkommen andere Trainingsschwerpunkte gesetzt, als er es gewohnt gewesen sei: Sie habe vor allem Krafttraining und Anhebung der Laktatschwelle in den Fokus gestellt, während seine Konzentration auf Radfahren und Herz-Kreislauf-Training lag. In der Saison 2000/01 entschied Ohno zwölf Weltcup-Einzelrennen und drei Mehrkämpfe für sich. Am Saisonende stand er an der Spitze der Weltcup-Gesamtwertung im Mehrkampf (vor dem mehrfachen Weltmeister Li Jiajun aus China) sowie der 500-Meter-, 1000-Meter- und 1500-Meter-Klassements. Bei den Weltmeisterschaften 2001 in Jeonju gewann Ohno hinter Li die Silbermedaille im Mehrkampf mit einem Streckensieg im abschließenden 3000-Meter-Rennen und wurde zudem gemeinsam mit Rusty Smith, Daniel Weinstein und Ron Biondo zum ersten Mal Staffelweltmeister.', 'Olympische Winterspiele 2002.', 'Im Dezember 2001 qualifizierte sich Ohno mit mehreren Streckensiegen bei den nationalen Auswahlrennen für die Olympischen Winterspiele 2002 in Salt Lake City. Über 1500 Meter stellte er dabei mit einer Zeit von 2:13,728 Minuten einen Weltrekord auf. Nach den Wettkämpfen warf der nicht qualifizierte Tommy O’Hare Ohno und Rusty Smith vor, das abschließende 1000-Meter-Rennen absichtlich gegen ihren Freund Shani Davis verloren zu haben, um Davis die Olympiateilnahme zu ermöglichen. Ein Schlichter sprach die beschuldigten Athleten im Januar 2002 von jeglichem Fehlverhalten frei. O’Hare hatte seine formelle Beschwerde bereits zuvor zurückgezogen.', 'In Salt Lake City gewann Ohno die Silbermedaille im 1000-Meter-Rennen und wurde Olympiasieger über die 1500-Meter-Distanz. Das 1000-Meter-Finale endete mit einem Sturz der führenden vier Läufer Li Jiajun, Ohno, Ahn Hyun-soo und Mathieu Turcotte in der letzten Kurve vor dem Ziel. Der abgehängte Australier Steven Bradbury profitierte von dem Zwischenfall und überquerte die Ziellinie als Erster, gefolgt von Ohno, der sich nach dem Sturz aufrichtete, dann wieder fiel und auf Händen und Füßen über die Ziellinie rutschte. Damit gewann er die Silbermedaille. Das 1500-Meter-Rennen wurde ab der Wettkampfhälfte vom Südkoreaner Kim Dong-sung angeführt. Ohno setzte sich in der vorletzten Runde hinter Kim an die zweite Stelle. In der letzten Runde schickte er sich an, den Koreaner zu überholen, brach das Manöver aber ab – mutmaßlich weil Kim ihn blockiert hatte – und hob die Hände in die Luft. Kim erreichte das Ziel vor Ohno als Erster, wurde aber kurz danach wegen \\"cross-tracking\\" (= Behinderung von Ohno durch Kreuzen seines Laufweges) vom Schiedsrichter James Hewish disqualifiziert. Unter dem Beifall des überwiegend amerikanischen Publikums bekam Ohno den Olympiasieg zugesprochen. Die Entscheidung zog ein kontroverses Echo nach sich. Während Ohno sie als eindeutig richtig ansah und Unterstützung etwa vom Bronzemedaillengewinner Marc Gagnon erhielt, bestritt insbesondere die südkoreanische Presse ein Foul Kims. Stattdessen unterstellten einige Zeitungen Ohno Schauspielerei und unsportliches Verhalten („Hollywood action“): Er sei nicht schnell genug gewesen, um Kim zu überholen, seine Geste des Handhebens sei ein Trick gewesen, um die Aufmerksamkeit des Schiedsrichters und des Publikums auf sich zu ziehen.', 'Das Koreanische Olympische Komitee protestierte erfolglos beim Internationalen Olympischen Komitee, bei der Internationalen Eislaufunion und beim Internationalen Sportgerichtshof gegen die Disqualifikation Kims. Ohno erhielt nach dem Wettkampf mindestens 40 Morddrohungen per E-Mail und stand für den Rest der Winterspiele unter Polizeischutz. Er blieb in den verbliebenen beiden Wettkämpfen ohne Medaille: Über 500 Meter wurde er im Halbfinale wegen Behinderung eines Gegners disqualifiziert, im Staffelfinale stürzte sein Mannschaftskollege Rusty Smith, das US-Team belegte letztlich den vierten Rang.', 'Entwicklung und Erfolge zwischen 2002 und 2010.', 'In den Wintern nach seinem ersten Olympiasieg blieb Ohno Teil der Weltspitze im Shorttrack. 2002/03 und 2004/05 entschied er zum zweiten beziehungsweise dritten Mal den Mehrkampf-Gesamtweltcup für sich, in der dazwischenliegenden Saison 2003/04 belegte er Rang drei in dieser Wertung hinter Ahn Hyun-soo und Song Suk-woo. Bei den Weltmeisterschaften 2005 in Peking siegte Ohno über 1000 Meter sowie 3000 Meter und gewann hinter Ahn die Silbermedaille im Mehrkampf. Als prägend für die Zeit zwischen den Winterspielen in Salt Lake City und denen in Turin 2006 bezeichnete Ohno in seiner 2010 erschienenen Autobiographie das weiterhin angespannte Verhältnis zur südkoreanischen Öffentlichkeit. Aus Sicherheitsbedenken sagten er und seine Teamkollegen die Teilnahme am Weltcup im November 2003 in Jeonju ab. Erst 2005 trat er unter strengen Schutzvorkehrungen wieder zu einem Wettkampf in Südkorea an, wurde zweimal disqualifiziert und entschied zwei Rennen für sich. Auch zur Entspannung seiner Beziehung mit der koreanischen Presse reiste Ohno im Sommer 2006 nach Südkorea und trainierte dort gemeinsam mit den ortsansässigen Athleten in der Nähe von Seoul.', 'Um mit jüngeren, leichteren Konkurrenten wie Ahn Hyun-soo mithalten zu können, arbeitete Ohno an seinem Körper: Mit Unterstützung seines Privattrainers John Schaeffer, der ihn seit 2003 parallel zur neuen Nationaltrainerin Li Yan betreute, stellte er seine Ernährung um, verzichtete weitgehend auf kohlehydratreiche Kost und verringerte seinen Körperfettanteil bis 2010 auf 2,8 Prozent. In den Jahren vor Olympia 2010 reduzierte er sein Gewicht um mehrere Kilogramm auf 66 kg.

Jahrhundert)', 'Gemälde von Édouard Manet', 'Selbstbildnis'], 'Das Selbstporträt mit Palette (französischer Titel \\"Autoportrait à la palette\\", \\"Portrait de Manet par lui-même, en buste\\" oder \\"Manet à la palette\\") ist ein Gemälde des französischen Malers Édouard Manet. Das 83 × 67 cm große, in Öl auf Leinwand gemalte Bild schuf Manet 1879. Es gehört zum vom Impressionismus beeinflussten Spätwerk des Künstlers. \\"Selbstporträt mit Palette\\" ist eines der wenigen Bilder Manets, in denen er sich selbst darstellte. Als Vorbild für das Gemälde wird ein Selbstbildnis von Diego Velázquez betrachtet. Das Gemälde befindet sich in Privatbesitz.', 'Bildbeschreibung.', 'Das 83 × 67 cm große Gemälde zeigt ein Halbporträt des Malers Édouard Manet. In diesem Selbstbildnis als Maler stellte er sich als modischen Boulevardier vor einem dunklen Hintergrund dar. Der Abgebildete trägt eine schwarze Melone und ein braunes Jackett, darunter ein weißes Hemd, von dem nur der Kragen zu sehen ist. Den Brustausschnitt der Anzugjacke bedeckt eine schwarze Seidenkrawatte, die von einer Krawattennadel fixiert wird. In der linken, nur undeutlich dargestellten Hand hält er einen langen Holzpinsel mit roter Farbe auf den Borsten, die rechte Hand hält eine Palette sowie drei weitere Pinsel. Auf weitere Accessoires wird verzichtet. Die Figur wird von rechts beleuchtet, wodurch die Schattenbildungen unterhalb des rechten Armes sowie in der linken Gesichtshälfte entstehen. Durch die leicht nach links gedreht erscheinende Haltung ist die linke Körperhälfte zudem dunkler als die vordere, rechte Körperhälfte. Der Blick des Malers ist nach vorn auf den Betrachter gerichtet. Da Manet allerdings mit ziemlicher Sicherheit kein Linkshänder war, ist das Bild des Malers ein Abbild in Form einer seitenverkehrten Darstellung, wie sie in einem Spiegelbild erscheint.', 'Entstehung und Deutung.', 'Wie durch Röntgenanalysen festgestellt wurde, übermalte Édouard Manet mit seinem \\"Selbstporträt mit Palette\\" ein Profilbildnis seiner Frau Suzanne. Sie war in diesem Bild in einer ähnlichen Pose dargestellt wie im Gemälde \\"Madame Manet am Klavier\\" (1868, Musée d’Orsay).', 'Die Datierung des Bildes geht auf Manets Freund Théodore Duret zurück, der nach Manets Tod hierzu Léon Leenhoff, den Sohn von Manets Frau befragte. Zudem verwendete Manet die Anzugjacke im \\"Selbstporträt mit Palette\\" ebenfalls im 1879 entstandenen Gemälde \\"Beim Père Lathuille, im Freien\\" für die Darstellung des Sohnes des Restaurantbesitzers.', 'Als Vorbild für das \\"Selbstporträt mit Palette\\" wird das Gemälde \\"Las Meninas\\" aus dem Jahr 1656 von Diego Velázquez betrachtet, in dem sich der Künstler ebenfalls mit Pinsel und Palette präsentiert. Hier steht der Maler allerdings im Hintergrund seines Ateliers, während den Vordergrund sein Modell einnimmt, die fünfjährige Margarita Teresa von Spanien mit ihren Bediensteten. Manet übernahm daraus die Pose des Malers und die Malutensilien, wodurch er, anders als Velázquez, sich selbst zum thematischen Zentrum des Bildes machte. Zugleich ist er jedoch aktiv und überlässt die Ausgestaltung seiner Umgebung sowie die Vorstellung eines im Entstehen begriffenen Gemäldes der Phantasie des Betrachters. Manet selbst malte den spanischen Maler in einer Atelierszene zwischen 1865 und 1870 in einer dem Selbstporträt Velasquez’ ähnlichen Pose.', 'Üblicherweise trugen und tragen Maler bei der Arbeit keine Ausgehkleidung, da diese durch die Ölfarben zu leicht verschmutzt werden könnte. Manets Selbstbildnis als Maler in modischer Stadtkleidung hat verschiedene Vorbilder. Bereits Velázquez trägt im Gemälde \\"Die Hoffräulein\\" eine kostbare, bei Hof übliche Kleidung. 1870 saß Manet dem Maler Henri Fantin-Latour im Gemälde \\"Un atelier aux Batignolles\\" ebenfalls als gutgekleideter Künstler Modell. Auch das Tragen eines Hutes in einem Innenraum hatte bei der Darstellung eines Malers ein unmittelbares Vorbild. So porträtierte Pierre-Auguste Renoir seinen Malerkollegen Claude Monet bereits 1875 mit Anzug und Hut. So wie Velázquez durch seine Kleidung seine Nähe zum spanischen Hof unterstreicht, zeigt Manets Kleidung seine Rolle als modischer und erfolgreicher Pariser Künstler, „der nicht nur in seiner künstlerischen Haltung, sondern auch in seinem Auftreten und Aussehen vollkommen dem Modell des ‚peintre de la vie moderne‘ von Baudelaire entspricht“.', 'Auffällig in dem Gemälde ist die unfertig wirkende linke Hand mit dem Pinsel des Malers. Victor Stoichiţă erkennt hier eine Absicht Manets und interpretiert sie folgendermaßen: „Obschon es ein Malakt ist, der hier gezeigt wird, dreht sich die Malerei um sich selbst wie ein Wirbelwind.“ Nach Françoise Cachin erkläre sich diese Gestaltung mit der Intention, das Licht und die Gedanken auf die wesentlichen Aspekte des Bildes zu konzentrieren. Suzanne Manet, die Ehefrau des Künstlers, bezeichnete allerdings sowohl dieses Bild als auch das \\"Selbstporträt mit Käppchen\\" (frz. \\"Autoportrait\\", 1878/79) als Skizzen.', 'Bereits 1870 schuf der Malerkollege und Freund Manets ein Bild mit dem Titel \\"Un atelier aux Batignolles\\", in dem er Manet malend in der Runde seiner Freunde und Bewunderer darstellte. Auf diesem Gemälde sitzt Manet vor der Staffelei, den Pinsel mit der rechten Hand führend. Fantin-Latour wollte mit dem in akademischer Malweise ausgeführten Bild die Ernsthaftigkeit der Arbeit Manets sowie der jungen Generation französischer Künstler zum Ausdruck bringen. Dieser Plan scheiterte allerdings und führte zu Spott über die zentrale Position Manets inmitten seiner Bewunderer, der in einer zeitgenössischen Karikatur in \\"Le Journal amusant\\" seinen Ausdruck fand; dort wurde Manet verglichen mit Jesus in der Mitte seiner Jünger. Weitere Gemälde Henri Fantin-Latours, auf denen Manet dargestellt ist, waren unter anderem ein Porträt aus dem Jahre 1867 und die \\"Hommage à Delacroix\\" von 1864, in der er auch sich selbst abbildete und weitere Maler seiner Generation vor dem Porträt Eugène Delacroixs versammelte.', 'Einordnung in das Gesamtwerk.', 'Das \\"Selbstporträt mit Palette\\" ist das einzige Selbstporträt Manets, in dem er sich als Künstler darstellte. Darüber hinaus stellte er sich noch in weiteren Gemälden selbst dar: \\"Der Fischfang\\" (frz. \\"La pêche\\", 1860/61), \\"Musik im Tuileriengarten\\" (frz. \\"Musique aux Tuileries\\", 1862) und \\"Maskenball in der Oper\\" (\\"Bal Masqué à l’Opéra\\", 1873); auf diesen Bildern zeigte er sich allerdings nicht im Vordergrund, sondern als Teil einer Gesamtkomposition. ', 'Nur das etwa zur gleichen Zeit entstandene \\"Selbstporträt mit Käppchen\\", ein Ganzporträt, wird als weiteres echtes Selbstbildnis verstanden. Es hängt heute im Artizon Museum in Tokio. Die zeitliche Nähe der beiden Gemälde lässt auf einen direkten Zusammenhang zwischen ihnen schließen, sie werden entsprechend als zwei Stadien eines Werkvorgangs interpretiert. Im ersten Bild, dem \\"Selbstporträt mit Palette\\", ist der Malakt selbst dargestellt, erkennbar an der aktiven und in den Vordergrund gerückten Geste des Malers. Das Ganzporträt zeigt den Maler dagegen in einem deutlichen Abstand zum Betrachter. Nach Éric Darragon scheint es, als nehme der Maler „Abstand, um sein Gemälde zu beurteilen“.', 'Nach Manets Tod hingen die beiden Bilder zu beiden Seiten des 1877 entstandenen Gemäldes \\"Jean-Baptiste Faure in der Rolle des Hamlet\\". Stoichiţă zieht aus dieser Anordnung den Schluss, dass durch die Wahl des spanisch wirkenden Gemäldes eine erneute Parallele zu Velázquez entstehen sollte, wobei die Aussage einer Platzierung neben der Präsentationsrolle Faures als Hamlet allerdings darin liegen könnte, dass mit den Selbstporträts \\"Manet in der Rolle von Manet\\" dargestellt werden sollte. Nach Juliet Wilson-Bareau wurden die Bilder aber wahrscheinlich nicht von Manet selbst so arrangiert; sie geht vielmehr davon aus, dass Léon Leenhoff die Bilder rahmen ließ und dann zu beiden Seiten des Faure-Gemäldes aufhing.', 'Rezeption.', 'In der Bedeutung wurde das Gemälde sehr häufig als von geringerem künstlerischen Wert eingeschätzt. Der Kritiker Étienne Moreau-Nélaton schrieb 1926 sinngemäß: „Diese Arbeit wie auch der andere Versuch wird von einer gewissen Kälte verdorben. Zuviel Feuer führt die Hand, sie malt hier so frei, daß sich der Maler unmöglich ernsthaft auf sich selbst als Gegenstand konzentrieren kann.“ Andererseits betonte Theodore Reff 1982 die Bedeutung der Entscheidung Manets, sich zum Höhepunkt seiner Karriere mit zwei Selbstporträts einem Genre zu nähern, das er bislang nie versucht hatte. Vor allem die gewählte Kleidung, in beiden Fällen ein modischer Anzug, drücke aus, dass sich Manet als Teil des zeitgenössischen und modernen Lebens sah, nach Théodore Duret gehörte er zur „Pariser Prominenz“ und war sich dessen auch bewusst.', 'Wilson-Bareau liefert eine alternative Erklärung für die Entstehung der Selbstporträts. Nach Adolphe Tabarant befragte der Zeitgenosse Théodore Duret Léon Leenhoff nach dem Zeitpunkt, an dem Manet von seiner Syphilis-Erkrankung erfahren habe. Leenhoff gab als Antwort das Jahr 1879 an, wodurch erklärbar wird, dass Manet, der ansonsten in seinem Leben nie an einem Selbstporträt gearbeitet hat, in diesem Jahr zwei Bilder dieses Genres gemalt hat. Offensichtlich wollte er, da er nun die eigene Sterblichkeit vor Augen hatte, sich nochmals mit sich selbst beschäftigen.', 'Provenienz.', 'Das \\"Selbstporträt mit Palette\\" wurde zu Manets Lebzeiten nicht verkauft und ging nach seinem Tod in den Besitz seiner Witwe Suzanne über. In der Nachlassauktion im Jahre 1884 wurden beide Selbstporträts allerdings nicht versteigert, Manets Frau wollte sich wahrscheinlich erst 1897 von ihnen auf Anraten von Antonin Proust trennen, der ihr in einem Schreiben vom 10. Mai 1897 darlegte, dass weder Jean-Baptiste Faure noch Auguste Pellerin an den Bildern interessiert seien.', 'Am 2. Februar 1899 vermachte Suzanne Manet die Bilder ihrer Schwester Martina Leenhoff, wahrscheinlich um ihr damit aus finanziellen Schwierigkeiten zu helfen. Im gleichen Jahr versuchten Frau Manet und Proust erneut, die beiden Bilder zu verkaufen, interessiert waren der deutsche Kunsthändler Hermann Paechter sowie der Franzose Ambroise Vollard. Paechter erhielt beide Bilder im gleichen Jahr zum Preis von 6.000 Francs für das \\"Selbstporträt mit Käpp: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Gemälde, Édouard Manet, Selbstbildnis, Palette, Diego Velázquez, Modische Stadtkleidung, Unfertige linke Hand, Selbstporträts, Provenienz"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: [['Robben'], 'Die Ohrenrobben (Otariidae) sind eine Familie meist großer Robben, die an zahlreichen Felsenküsten der Weltmeere große Kolonien bilden. Aufgrund ihrer kräftigeren Gliedmaßen können sie sich im Vergleich zu den Hundsrobben besser an Land bewegen. Die meisten Arten werden aufgrund äußerer Merkmale zu den \\"Seebären\\" und \\"Seelöwen\\" gezählt. Dabei sind Seebären üblicherweise stärker behaart und im Schnitt kleiner als Seelöwen, aber ausweislich genetischer Untersuchungen entspricht dies nicht den realen Verwandtschaftsverhältnissen.', 'Die Familie wurde 1825 durch den britischen Zoologen John Edward Gray wissenschaftlich beschrieben und erhielt ihren wissenschaftlichen Namen, der sich vom Gattungsnamen \\"Otaria\\" ableitet; in diese Gattung wurden früher verschiedene Arten der Ohrenrobben gestellt, heute nur noch die Mähnenrobbe (\\"Otaria flavescens\\").', 'Merkmale.', 'Habitus.', 'Ohrenrobbenmännchen der Neuseeländischen Seelöwen (\\"Phocarctos hookeri\\") können bis zu 3,50 Meter groß werden, während Weibchen der Galápagos-Seebären (\\"Arctocephalus galapagoensis\\") manchmal nur eine Körperlänge von einem Meter erreichen. Das Gewicht hat je nach Art und Geschlecht eine Spannbreite von 25 Kilogramm bei manchen Weibchen der Südlichen Seebären (\\"Arctocephalus\\") bis über 500 Kilogramm bei Männchen der Stellerschen Seelöwen (\\"Eumetopias jubatus\\"). Auffällig ist der deutliche Sexualdimorphismus aller Arten: Die Männchen können je nach Art bis zu 2,5-mal so groß und bis zu 6-mal so schwer werden wie die Weibchen. Bei den Nördlichen Seebären (\\"Callorhinus ursinus\\") sind die Männchen zum Beispiel ungefähr viereinhalb mal so schwer wie die Weibchen. Generell sind die ausgewachsenen Seelöwen etwas größer als die Seebären, wobei ein ausgewachsenes Seelöwen-Männchen zwischen 360 und 600 Kilogramm und ein Seebären-Männchen zwischen 60 und 270 und ein Weibchen 34 bis 56 Kilogramm wiegt. Das Gewicht der Männchen ist dabei wesentlich bedingt durch eingelagertes Fett, dass die Tiere während der Paarungszeit und bei Rivalenkämpfen als Energiereserve nutzen.', 'Der Körper ist schlank und spindelförmig. Im Vergleich zu den Hundsrobben haben sie einen im Verhältnis längeren Hals und dafür einen kürzeren, gedrungeneren Körper zwischen den Flossen. Die Schultern und der Nacken sind muskulös, vor allem bei den kräftigeren Männchen. Neben dem kräftigen Nacken weisen die Männchen zudem eine Nackenmähne auf, die von längeren Haaren im Nackenbereich gebildet wird.', 'Im Gegensatz zu den Hundsrobben haben Ohrenrobben Flossen, die auch bei der Fortbewegung an Land von großem Nutzen sind. Die Vorderflossen sind muskulös mit einer glatten, ledrigen Oberfläche. Sie sind, ganz besonders bei den Seebären, sehr lang mit einer breiten Vorderkante und weisen je fünf Zehen mit rudimentär erhaltenen Nägeln auf, wobei die Zehenlänge von außen nach innen abnimmt. Die kürzeren Hinterflossen können unter den Körper gedreht und bei der Fortbewegung benutzt werden. Im Vergleich zu den Hundsrobben, denen dies nicht möglich ist, sind sie vergleichsweise lang und werden zum Ende breiter. Die fünf Zehen sind etwa gleich lang oder die beiden äußeren sind artabhängig etwas länger, wobei dann der erste Zeh auch kräftiger ist. Auf den drei mittleren Zehen befinden sich gut entwickelte Zehennägel, die beiden äußeren Nägel sind hingegen meist weitgehend degeneriert. Auch die Hinterflossen sind mit einer ledrigen schwarzen Haut bedeckt, rückenseits weisen sie eine kurze Behaarung auf. Alle Ohrenrobben haben zudem einen sehr kurzen Schwanz, der breit ansetzt und sich dann sehr schnell verjüngt.', 'Fell.', 'Ohrenrobben sind von einem Fell besetzt, insgesamt gibt es bei ihnen vier verschiedene Fell- bzw. Pelztypen. Das Fell der Seelöwen ist kurz aus borstenartigem Deckhaar. Bei den Seebären wird das Deckhaar gegen ein dichtes Unterfell ergänzt, das aus weicheren Wollhaaren gebildet wird. Bei den männlichen Tieren bildet sich zudem eine Nackenmähne aus längeren Deckhaaren, die vom Kopf über den Nacken bis auf die Schultern reicht. Jungtiere besitzen einen Pelz aus längeren Deckhaaren, der als „Geburtsfell“ bezeichnet wird.', 'Während sich die Tiere im Wasser befinden, legen sich die Haare dicht an den Körper an und solang sie nass sind, folgen sie der Kontur des Körpers. Sobald das Fell getrocknet ist, stellen sich die Haare vor allem im Bereich der Mähne auf. Das Wollhaar der Seebären trägt durch darin enthaltene Luftbläschen im Wasser zur Wärmeisolierung und Thermoregulation bei und wird in regelmäßigen Abständen erneuert. Das Fell erscheint dadurch an einige Stellen mit älterem Haar stumpfer und an neu gebildeten Stellen heller, dadurch wirkt es teilweise fleckig. Der Fellwechsel findet in der Regel vom Kopf und von den Flossen zum Körper hin statt, ein vollständiger Fellwechsel findet etwa jährlich statt und dauert in der Regel mehrere Wochen. Bei den Seebären werden erst die Haare des Unterfells und dann die vorstehenden Deck- oder Grannenhaare ersetzt. Anders als bei den Hundsrobben läuft dieser Vorgang weitgehend kontinuierlich ab, so dass nie alle Haare auf einmal abgestoßen werden. Die unter der Haut gelegene Fettschicht ist bei Ohrenrobben meist dünner als bei Hundsrobben.', 'Die Farbe der Tiere wird vor allem durch die Fellfarbe und die darunter liegende dunkle Haut bestimmt. Sie verändert sich über die Entwicklung zu den ausgewachsenen Tieren. Jungtiere sind durch ihr Geburtsfell in der Regel dunkelbraun bis schwarz gefärbt. Dieses Fell wird in den ersten Wochen nach und nach abgerieben und durch das normale Fell der Tiere ersetzt. Bei den heranwachsenden und den ausgewachsenen Tieren kann die Färbung schwarz, dunkel- und hell- bis sandbraun oder in sehr seltenen Fällen als Leuzismus auch cremeweiß sein; bei antarktischen Seebären kommt dies bei einem von etwa 1000 Tieren vor. Eine Zeichnung haben die Tiere nicht, mit zunehmendem Alter kommt es jedoch zu Unterschieden in der Färbung einzelner Körperbereiche, etwa im Bereich des Kopfes, der Kehle und des Bauches mit häufig Färbungen. Zudem werden bei ausgewachsenen Männchen häufig die Haarspitzen der Mähne grau. Auch Piebaldismus mit einzelnen weißen Flecken kommt in seltenen Fällen vor.', 'Sinnesorgane.', 'Wie schon der deutsche Name der Familie verrät, verfügen alle Tiere über äußerlich sichtbare Ohren. Sie sind meist etwa fünf Zentimeter lang, von knorpeliger Konsistenz und laufen nach außen spitz zu. Die Spitze weist nach hinten und unten. Bei den Seebären sind die Ohrmuscheln etwas länger und abstehender als bei den Seelöwen und somit deutlicher sichtbar. Zudem sind sie bei Jungtieren besonders gut zu sehen. Ohrenrobben können zwar hören, sie lokalisieren aber die Quelle der Geräusche nicht.', 'Die Nase und vor allem das Rhinarium ist fleischig und mit einer ledernen schwarzen Haut mit nur sehr wenigen Haaren bedeckt. Die Nasenlöcher befinden sich mittig oder leicht unterhalb der Mittellinie auf den Rhinarium und weisen meist leicht abwärts. Das Rhinarium selbst kann bei den verschiedenen Arten stumpf, zugespitzt, vergrößert oder sogar mit einer deutlichen Blasenartigen Verdickung besetzt sein.', 'Im Bereich der Schnauze haben Ohrenrobben teilweise lange und meist weiche Fühl- oder Barthaare (\\"Vibrissae\\"), die bei einzelnen Arten sehr lang werden können. Die Vibrissae der Jungtiere sind schwarz, mit dem Alter werden sie heller und bei ausgewachsenen Tieren können sie fast weiß sein. Die Vibrissae stellen hochsensible Sinnesorgane dar, mit denen im Wasser geringe Veränderungen der Strömung, etwa durch fliehende Beutetiere, registriert werden. An Land könnten sie zudem eine unterstützende Funktion beim Hören haben. Im Gegensatz zu den Hundsrobben kommen oberhalb der Augenhöhle grundsätzlich keine Fühlhaare vor.', 'Die Augen sind vergleichsweise klein und schwarz. Sie sind oval bis mandelförmig und mit einer Nickhaut ausgestattet. Wenn sich die Tiere an Land befinden, produzieren sie Tränenflüssigkeit, die die Umgebung der Augen benetzt und dadurch dunkel erscheinen lässt.', 'Schädel- und Skelettmerkmale.', 'Schädel und Gebiss.', 'Der Schädel der Ohrenrobben ähnelt stark dem Bärenschädel. Wie dort ist jeweils der große Flügel des Flügelbeins (\\"Os sphenoidale\\") von einem Kanal durchzogen, durch den die interne Kopfschlagader (\\"Arteria carotis interna\\") verläuft, die das Gehirn versorgt. Auch der Warzenfortsatz (\\"Processus mastoideus\\") des Schläfenbeins (\\"Os temporale\\"), an dem eine kräftige Muskulatur ansetzt, ist wie bei Bären deutlich ausgeprägt, aber von der verknöcherten Kapsel des Mittelohrs (\\"Bulla tympanica\\") klar getrennt. Der Gelenkkopf für das obere Kopfgelenk (\\"Articulatio atlanto-occipitalis\\"), der \\"Condylus occipitalis\\", ist weit nach oben versetzt. Die Augenhöhlen (\\"Orbita\\") sind nur unvollständig voneinander getrennt; an ihrem hinteren und oberen Rand besitzt das Stirnbein (\\"Os frontale\\") je zwei gut entwickelte Fortsätze, die als \\"Processus postorbitalis\\" und \\"Processus supraorbitalis\\" bezeichnet werden. Die beiden Unterkieferhälften sind bei Ohrenrobben nicht fest an der Symphyse (\\"Symphysis mandibulae\\") verwachsen. Bei den erwachsenen Männchen ist der Schädel etwas anders proportioniert als bei den Weibchen und weist in vielen Fällen einen auffälligen Scheitelkamm auf, der als Ansatz für die kräftige Kiefermuskulatur dient und auch von außen sichtbar ist.', 'Das Ohrenrobben-Gebiss verfügt auf jeder Seite über drei obere und zwei untere Schneidezähne; bis auf den äußersten oberen Schneidezahn sind sie alle zweihöckrig.

Im Nordosten Mitteleuropas gibt es einige wenige Brutvorkommen dieser Art. In Mitteleuropa ist er außerdem regelmäßig in kleiner Zahl als Durchzügler und Wintergast zu beobachten. Er trägt dann sein Schlichtkleid, in dem er mit dem in Mitteleuropa häufigeren Schwarzhalstaucher leicht zu verwechseln ist.', 'Erscheinungsbild.', 'Ohrentaucher haben eine Körperlänge von 31 bis 38 Zentimetern. Sie sind damit deutlich größer als Zwergtaucher und haben einen weniger gedrungenen Körperbau und einen längeren Hals als diese. Die Männchen sind im Mittel etwas größer als die Weibchen. Bei den Männchen sind die Handflügel zwischen 13,2 und 16,0 Zentimeter lang, der Schnabel misst von der Stirnbefiederung bis zur Spitze zwischen 2,0 und 2,7 Zentimeter und sie wiegen zwischen 320 und 570 Gramm. Weibchen haben eine Flügellänge zwischen 12,4 und 15,3 Zentimeter, ihr Schnabel ist mit 1,9 bis 2,5 Zentimeter geringfügig kürzer als der der Männchen. Weibchen wiegen im Winterhalbjahr zwischen 300 und 430 Gramm. Der Geschlechtsdimorphismus ist insgesamt so gering ausgeprägt, dass er keine feldornithologische Unterscheidung der Geschlechter ermöglicht.', 'Der Schnabel ist bei beiden Geschlechtern blaugrau bis schwarz mit einer fleischfarbenen Basis und einer hellen, fast weißlichen Spitze. Das Gefieder am Oberkopf ist beim Ohrentaucher eng anliegend. Die Iris ist während der Balzzeit intensiv rot und in der Ruhezeit rosa. Die Pupille ist von einem schmalen, silberweißen Ring umrandet. Die Beine sind grau, die Füße blau bis blaugrün. Die Beine setzen weit hinten am Körper an.', 'Prachtkleid.', 'Das Prachtkleid ist durch ein glänzend schwarzes, sowie in seltenen Fällen auch matt schwarzes, Kopfgefieder mit spreizbaren Federbüscheln an den Kopfseiten gekennzeichnet. Diese Feder- oder Ohrbüschel sind auffällig gelbrot und bestehen aus langen, schmalen Federn zwischen Auge und Hinterkopf. Die Federbüschel sind beim Männchen etwas ausgeprägter als beim Weibchen. Die schwarzen Federn an der Kehlseite und den Wangen sind ebenfalls stark verlängert und können abgespreizt werden. Vom Schnabelende bis zum Auge zieht sich ein schmaler, rotbrauner Zügelstreif. Der Hals ist vorn und an den Seiten rotbraun, der Nacken schwarz. Die Vorderbrust, die Brustseiten und die Flanken sind rotbraun, die Rumpfunterseite ist weiß. Bei schwimmenden Vögeln ist die weiße Unterseite meist nicht zu sehen. Das Rückengefieder ist schwarz, die einzelnen Federn sind grau gesäumt. Die Handschwingen sind braun und haben hellere Innenfahnen mit weißer Basis. Die Unterflügeldecken sind weiß.', 'Den auffälligen Kopfschmuck trägt der Ohrentaucher nur im Frühjahr. Ab etwa Mitte Juni weisen die Vögel nach einer Teilmauser einen Sommerkopfschmuck auf, bei dem die Federbüschel deutlich kürzer und weniger farbig sind. Ab Mitte Juli beginnen sich die weißen Wangen zu entwickeln, die für das Schlichtkleid charakteristisch sind. Es ist gewöhnlich das Weibchen, bei dem sich diese Mauser zuerst vollzieht. Beim Männchen vollzieht sich dieser Wechsel etwa einen Monat später.', 'Schlichtkleid.', 'Das im Herbst und Winter getragene Schlichtkleid ist überwiegend schwarz und weiß mit einem schwarzen Oberkopf und weißen Wangen. Der Rücken und die Rückseite des Halses sind dunkel gefiedert. Am schmalsten ist diese dunkle Befiederung am Oberhals. Der Vorderhals ist überwiegend weiß. An der Kehle haben adulte Vögel gelegentlich kleinere schwarze Flecken. Am Übergang des Halses zur Vorderbrust ist das Gefieder bräunlich verwaschen.', 'Die Kopfzeichnung ist beim Ohrentaucher auch im Schlichtkleid kontrastreich. Die reinweißen Wangen sind bei adulten Vögeln vom dunklen Oberkopf scharf abgesetzt, die Trennungslinie verläuft auf Augenhöhe. Das Weiß der Wangen dehnt sich fast bis zum Hinterkopf aus, so dass ein nahezu geschlossener weißer Nackenring ausgebildet ist. Über dem Zügelstreif befindet sich ebenfalls eine kleine weiße Federpartie, die sich von der Schnabelwurzel bis zum Auge erstreckt.', 'Küken und Jungvögel.', 'Das Dunenkleid frisch geschlüpfter Küken weist ein charakteristisches Streifenmuster auf. Auf der Körperoberseite wechseln sich breite, dunkelgraue bis schwarze Streifen mit feinen weißen Längsstreifen ab. Auf Kopf, Hals und Brust sind die schwarzen und weißen Streifen gleich breit.

Verglichen mit diesem ist der Schnabel beim Ohrentaucher gedrungener und gerader. Der Schwarzhalstaucher dagegen hat einen leicht aufgeworfenen Schnabel. Auch das Kopfprofil unterscheidet sich. Der Schwarzhalstaucher ist steilstirnig, während der Ohrentaucher wegen der flach anliegenden Federn am Oberkopf eine nur mäßig ansteigende Stirn hat.', 'Ohrentaucher und Schwarzhalstaucher gleichen sich im Schlichtkleid sehr. Neben der anderen Schnabelform und der steileren Stirn lässt sich der Schwarzhalstaucher im Schlichtkleid an dem fließenden Übergang zwischen dunklem Oberkopf und weißen Wangen erkennen. Die Wangen wirken dadurch insgesamt gräulicher.', 'Stimme.', 'Ohrentaucher sind grundsätzlich wenig ruffreudig und vorwiegend während der Balzzeit zu hören. Sie geben weiche Trillerrufe von sich, die sich lautmalerisch mit \\"dji-ji-ji…ji-jrrr\\" umschreiben lassen und an die Rufe des Zwergtauchers erinnern. Ein in der Tonhöhe abfallendes, nasales \\"Aaanrr\\" dient während der Balzzeit dazu, den Partnervogel zu locken. Die Rufweise ist dabei individuell so unterschiedlich ausgeprägt, dass daran einzelne Vögel unterschieden werden können. Die Stimmhöhe schwankt situationsbedingt. Der Alarmruf gleicht dem Lockruf während der Balz, ist jedoch in der Tonlage höher. Bei Auseinandersetzungen mit Artgenossen sind die Rufe ebenfalls höher und stärker abgehackt. Die Trillerrufe während der Paarung sind dagegen schneller, gleichmäßiger und tiefer.', 'Verbreitung.', 'Brutgebiet.', 'Ohrentaucher haben ein lückenhaft zirkumpolares Verbreitungsgebiet.

Für Polen liegen aus den letzten Jahren mehrere Brutnachweise vor. In Schleswig-Holstein kam es 1981 zur Ansiedlung eines Brutpaares, das bis 1987 zweimal erfolgreich brütete. Ein zweites Brutpaar hatte zwischen 1988 und 1999 bei alljährlichen Brutversuchen sieben erfolgreiche Bruten, aus denen insgesamt 16 Jungvögel hervorgingen. Seit 1999 gibt es ein zweites Vorkommen mit ein bis zwei Brutpaaren sowie Übersommerungen und Balz an einer dritten Stelle. Eine stärkere Ausbreitung in Mitteleuropa ist wegen Bestandsrückgängen im baltischen Raum derzeit nicht zu erwarten, jedoch scheint der derzeitige Bruterfolg ausreichend, um das Vorkommen in Schleswig-Holstein zu stabilisieren.', 'Während Ohrentaucher in Alaska und im Westen Kanadas weit verbreitet sind, gibt es im Osten Nordamerikas nur in der Nähe von Québec eine kleine, isolierte Brutpopulation von fünf bis fünfzehn Brutpaaren. Diese unterscheiden sich genetisch deutlich von den übrigen nordamerikanischen Populationen und sind vermutlich Abkömmlinge von europäischen Brutvögeln, die als Irrgäste nach einer Überwinterung an der Küste Südwest-Grönlands dorthin verschlagen wurden.', 'Überwinterung.', 'Die einzelnen Populationen der Ohrentaucher weisen kein einheitliches Zugverhalten auf. Sie sind Breitfrontzieher, die häufig nur kurze Zugstrecken zurücklegen. Einige europäische Populationen ziehen beispielsweise in westlicher Richtung zu den nächsten eisfrei bleibenden Meeresküsten, andere weisen eine südliche Zugrichtung auf. Die schottischen Populationen überwintern überwiegend in ihrem Brutgebiet. Überwinternde Ohrentaucher findet man unter anderem an den Küsten Irlands, der Atlantikküste Spaniens und im Südwesten Grönlands sowie im Nordwesten Norwegens. Sie halten sich dort gelegentlich auch im Winter nördlich des Polarkreises auf. Große überwinternde Populationen gibt es auch an der Küste der Ostsee.

Die Aufnahmerate liegt zwischen 50 und 100 %. Sie ist besonders hoch bei Natrium-Selenit (Na2SeO3) und etwas schlechter bei Selenomethionin (C4H9NO2Se) sowie Selenocystein (C3H7NO2Se). Als tägliche Zufuhr für Erwachsene werden von den Gesellschaften für Ernährung in Deutschland (DGE), der Schweiz (SGE/SVE) und Österreich (ÖGE) 30 bis 70 µg (bis maximal 300 µg) empfohlen. In den USA werden 55 µg für Frauen und 70 µg für Männer empfohlen und bei Kindern gewichts- und altersabhängig zwischen und 5 und 60 µg täglich. Bei den Empfehlungen handelt es sich um Schätzwerte, die aufgrund der Aktivität eines Enzyms, das zwingend Selen benötigt (Glutathionperoxidase s. u.), erstellt wurden.

Rund 28 % der Selenaufnahme stammen aus Fleisch, insbesondere Schweinefleisch; rund 16 % aus Eiern. Regionen mit besonders niedrigem Gehalt von Selen im Boden sind Teile von Skandinavien, China und Neuseeland. Die traditionelle japanische Ernährungsweise mit viel Fisch und Reis gilt als selenreich.

Das Transportprotein \\"Selenoprotein P\\" scheint ebenfalls für die Speicherung eine nennenswerte Bedeutung zu haben.', 'Ausscheidung.', 'Die Ausscheidung von Selen ist abhängig vom Selenstatus des Körpers, sie erfolgt vermehrt bei Überversorgung. Selen wird in erster Linie über den Urin, aber auch über den Stuhl ausgeschieden. Insbesondere bei vermehrter Aufnahme wird es zusätzlich als Dimethylselenid (C2H6Se) abgeatmet, wobei ein knoblauchähnlicher Geruch entsteht.', 'Physiologie.', 'In Eiweiße wird Selen vom menschlichen Körper ausschließlich als Selenocystein eingebaut.

История регулярных выражений начинается в середине двадцатого века, и с тех пор они развивались и становились все более сложными и полезными. Первые концепции, лежащие в основе регулярных выражений, были представлены в 1940-х и 50-х годах. Американский математик Стивен Клини и железнодорожный инженер Уоррен Маккаллок работали над формализацией понимания понятия язык. В итоге они опубликовали статью, где представили базовые принципы регулярных языков, которые впоследствии стали основой для регулярных выражений. В 1956 году математик Стивен Клини опубликовал работу, где определил основные операции регулярных выражений - конкатенация, альтернатива и замыкание по Клини. Это был важный шаг в развитии теории регулярных выражений. Наибольший вклад в развитие и популяризацию регулярных выражений принадлежит Кену Томпсону, американскому инженеру, участнику создания UNIX и языка программирования C. В 1968 году Томпсон впервые реализовал алгоритм поиска строк с использованием регулярных выражений в программе ed, текстовом редакторе в системе UNIX. Благодаря успеху ed, регулярные выражения были включены и в другие стандартные утилиты UNIX, такие как grep и sed. Это привело к распространению регулярных выражений и их использованию во многих областях программирования. В 1980-х годах регулярные выражения начали внедряться в языки программирования. Perl, язык программирования, созданный Ларри Уоллом, стал одним из первых таких языков. Наличие регулярных выражений в Perl значительно расширило их возможности и упростило работу с текстом. С тех пор регулярные выражения были включены в большинство популярных языков программирования, таких как Python, Java, C#, PHP и многих других. Они также стали неотъемлемой частью интернета, используясь в веб-браузерах и серверных приложениях для работы с текстом и обработки данных. Несмотря на то что сейчас существуют множество улучшенных версий и дополнений к теории регулярных выражений, основные принципы их работы практически не изменились.

Erst danach entstand ein Pfad. 1728 ließ Kaiser Karl VI. eine steile Straße mit Steigungen bis zu 17 % errichten.', 'Da diese Straße den Verkehrsbedürfnissen des 19. Jahrhunderts nicht mehr entsprach, wollte bereits Erzherzog Johann eine Eisenbahn von Wien nach Triest nicht über Ungarn, sondern über den Semmering und damit durch die Steiermark, in der seine wirtschaftlichen Interessen lagen, bauen. Dazu bat er als Chef der Genietruppe seinen Bruder, Kaiser Franz I., seine besten Ingenieur-Offiziere zur Nivellierung der Strecke einsetzen zu dürfen. Mit der durch die steiermärkischen Stände schnell erfüllten Vorbedingung, den Militäretat finanziell nicht zu belasten, genehmigte der Kaiser die Arbeiten. Erzherzog Johann beauftragte Oberst Felix von Stregen mit der Leitung einer Offiziersgruppe, die die Nivellierung vornahm. Im Gegensatz zu Stregen, der im Vertrauen auf die sich weiterentwickelnde Lokomotivtechnik die Überwindung des Passes per Adhäsionsbahn für machbar einschätzte, hielt dies sein Untergebener Ingenieur-Hauptmann Carl Lobinger für technisch unmöglich. Auf niederösterreichischer Seite bestand bereits die Strecke bis Gloggnitz (1842), auf steirischer Seite eine bis Mürzzuschlag (1844). Die Endpunkte der beiden Strecken waren durch eine 1841 gebaute Straße verbunden, auf der alle Güter mit Pferdegespannen mit bis zu zwölf vorgespannten Pferden über den Pass transportiert wurden.', 'Planung.', 'Zur Ablösung des kostenintensiven Straßentransports war eine Schienenverbindung zwischen Gloggnitz und Mürzzuschlag erforderlich. Allerdings bestanden damals Zweifel an der technischen Möglichkeit der Realisierung.', 'Der Baudirektionsadjunkt und spätere Baudirektor Carl von Ghega erhielt 1841 den Auftrag, die Semmeringquerung zu planen.

Beim Bau längerer Tunnel wurden in Abständen senkrechte Schächte abgeteuft, um Zwischenangriffe von diesen aus vortreiben zu können. Diese Methode wird auch heute noch angewandt, um den Bau zu beschleunigen oder wenn geologische Verhältnisse es erfordern. Tunnel wurden noch von Hand bergmännisch vorangetrieben, da es außer Schwarzpulver noch keinen besser geeigneten Sprengstoff, wie etwa Dynamit, gab. Der Tunnelbau war risikobehaftet: Der Weinzettelwand-Tunnel musste nach einem Felssturz am 27. Oktober 1850, bei dem 14 Bergleute starben, neu trassiert werden. Ursprünglich wollte man die Trasse durch einen kurzen Tunnel und in Galerien entlang der Weinzettelwand führen, danach wurde die Strecke in den Berg verlegt. Es wurden drei Tunnel gesprengt, die durch zwei Galerien verbunden wurden: Die Tunnel trugen die Namen \\"Lechner-Tunnel\\", \\"Am Geierneste\\" und \\"Unter der Geierkirche\\". Von den Galerien hatte die eine nur eine Öffnung, die zweite sechs Öffnungen. Erst danach bürgerte sich für die ganze Konstruktion der Name \\"Weinzettelwand-Tunnel\\" ein.

Deshalb und um Baukosten zu sparen, wurden die Viadukte als Kreisbögen errichtet.

Diese Temperaturunterschiede werden besonders im Winter deutlich, wenn auf den Höhen noch Schnee liegt, er jedoch in der Ebene schon längst weggetaut ist. Die mittlere Jahresniederschlagssumme liegt in Öhringen bei 734 mm, in den höher gelegenen Gebieten der Keuperwaldberge fallen bis zu 1000 mm und teilweise darüber. Der Frühlingseinzug mit dem Beginn der Apfelblüte liegt in Öhringen um den 4. Mai, weiter östlich später, weiter westlich früher. Der Deutsche Wetterdienst betreibt in Öhringen eine Wetterwarte.', 'Die Auswirkungen der globalen Erwärmung sind auch in Öhringen messbar.

Maximal tausend Soldaten hatten in den beiden Garnisonen zur Sicherung und Überwachung der römischen Reichsgrenze ihr Quartier. Zu den militärischen Anlagen entstand ein rund 20 bis 30 Hektar großer wirtschaftlich bedeutender ziviler Ort mit einer wohlhabenden Einwohnerschaft. Seinen inschriftlich überlieferten Namen, \\"Vicus Aurelianus\\", erhielt der Ort höchstwahrscheinlich zu Ehren des römischen Kaisers Mark Aurel. Die Alamannenüberfälle der Jahre 259 und 260 n. Chr. führten zum Fall des Limes und zum Untergang des römischen Öhringen. Für eine alamannische Siedlung in Öhringen gibt es keinen archäologischen Beweis.

Mit mehreren Tribünenneubauten stieg sie bis 2009 wieder auf den heutigen Stand.', 'Im Old Trafford fanden zahlreiche bedeutende Fußballspiele statt, darunter Länderspiele der englischen Fußballnationalmannschaft, Spiele der Fußball-Weltmeisterschaft 1966 und der Fußball-Europameisterschaft 1996, das Finale der UEFA Champions League 2002/03 sowie Spiele des olympischen Fußballturniers 2012. Das Old Trafford ist auch Austragungsort wichtiger Begegnungen in der Sportart Rugby League, darunter die Finalspiele der Weltmeisterschaften 2000 und 2013; darüber hinaus findet hier seit 1998 das Finale der Super League statt.', 'Geschichte.', 'Stadionbau und erste Jahre.', 'Der Manchester United Football Club, 1878 als \\"Newton Heath L&amp;Y Railway Football Club\\" gegründet, spielte in den ersten drei Jahrzehnten seines Bestehens an zwei verschiedenen Standorten: zunächst bis 1893 an der North Road im Stadtteil Newton Heath, anschließend an der Bank Street in Clayton. Beide Stadien waren von sehr schlechten Platzverhältnissen geprägt, bei denen die Spielfelder eher Kiesgruben oder Sümpfen glichen. An der Bank Street litten die Spieler zusätzlich unter den Rauchschwaden benachbarter Fabriken. Der Brauereiunternehmer John Henry Davies bewahrte den Verein 1902 vor dem Konkurs und benannte ihn in Manchester United um. Als mit dem Meistertitel 1908 und dem Pokalsieg 1909 erfolgreichere Zeiten anbrachen, hielt er das Stadion an der Bank Street nicht mehr für angemessen, so dass er Geldmittel für ein neues Stadion zur Verfügung stellte. Davies hielt in und um Manchester Ausschau nach einem geeigneten Standort und fand eine freie Fläche neben dem Bridgewater-Kanal in Old Trafford.', 'Der erste Entwurf des schottischen Architekten Archibald Leitch, der zuvor bereits mehrere Stadien entworfen hatte, sah eine Kapazität von 100.000 Zuschauern vor. Während an der Südseite eine überdachte Sitzplatztribüne geplant war, sollten an den drei übrigen Seiten nicht überdachte Stehplatzterrassen entstehen. Zusammen mit dem Landkauf wurden die Baukosten auf ursprünglich insgesamt 60.000 Pfund Sterling veranschlagt. Als die Kosten zu steigen begannen, wären 30.000 Pfund zusätzlich notwendig geworden, um die beabsichtigte Kapazität zu erreichen. Auf Anregung von Vereinssekretär John Bentley wurde die Kapazität auf ungefähr 80.000 Zuschauer reduziert. Trotz dieser Sparmaßnahme festigten die hohen Baukosten den seit der Übernahme durch Davies erworbenen Ruf von Manchester United als „Geldsack“-Verein \\"(Moneybags United)\\", zumal die Ablösesummen sich damals um 1.000 Pfund bewegten.', 'Im Mai 1908 versuchte Leitch die Eisenbahngesellschaft Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC), die unmittelbar neben dem vorgeschlagenen Baugelände ein Depot besaß, durch ein Schreiben zu überzeugen, den Bau der Haupttribüne neben der Bahnlinie finanziell mit 10.000 Pfund zu unterstützen – rückzahlbar durch jährliche Raten von 2.000 Pfund oder durch die Hälfte der Einnahmen aus dem Eintrittskartenverkauf der Haupttribüne bis zur Begleichung des Darlehens. Trotz der Zusicherung, dass der Verein selbst und zwei von Davies geführte lokale Brauereien für das Darlehen bürgen würden, lehnte die CLC den Vorschlag ab. Die CLC hatte geplant, neben dem neuen Stadion einen Bahnhof zu bauen. Der Bahnhof Trafford Park entstand schließlich knapp zwei Kilometer weiter stadtauswärts als ursprünglich geplant. Zwei Jahrzehnte später entstand eine kleine Haltestelle mit hölzernen Bahnsteigen unmittelbar neben dem Stadion. Sie wurde am 21. August 1935 eröffnet und hieß zunächst \\"United Football Ground\\", erhielt aber zu Beginn des folgenden Jahres die neue Bezeichnung \\"Old Trafford Football Ground\\".', 'Die Bauarbeiten am Stadion führte das Unternehmen \\"Messrs Brameld and Smith\\" aus Manchester aus, Ende 1909 war das Bauprojekt abgeschlossen. Das Eröffnungsspiel fand am 19. Februar 1910 statt: Manchester United empfing den FC Liverpool und verlor mit 3:4. Ein beim Spiel anwesender Journalist des \\"Sporting Chronicle\\" berichtete, dieses Stadion sei „die ansehnlichste, weitläufigste und außergewöhnlichste Arena, die ich jemals gesehen habe. Als Fußballstadion ist sie in der Welt unerreicht, sie ist eine Ehre für Manchester und die Heimat einer Mannschaft, die Wunder vollbringen kann, wenn sie entsprechend gewillt ist.“', 'Vor dem Bau des Wembley-Stadions im Jahr 1923 fanden die Endspiele des FA Cup in wechselnden Stadien in England statt, zweimal auch im Old Trafford. Die erste Begegnung war die Wiederholung des Endspiels von 1911 zwischen Bradford City und Newcastle United, nachdem das eigentliche Endspiel in Crystal Palace nach Verlängerung mit einem torlosen Unentschieden geendet hatte. In Manchester setzte sich Bradford am 26. April vor 58.000 Zuschauern mit 1:0 durch. Das zweite Endspiel fand am 24. April 1915 statt. Dabei siegte Sheffield United mit 3:0 gegen den FC Chelsea. Da die meisten der 50.000 Zuschauer Militärangehörige waren, erhielt dieses Spiel den Spitznamen \\"Khaki Cup Final\\". Das erste Länderspiel im Old Trafford folgte am 17. April 1926: Vor 49.429 Zuschauern verlor England mit 0:1 gegen Schottland.', 'Kriegsschäden.', 'Als Teil eines 35.000 Pfund teuren Modernisierungsprogramms erhielt die Nordtribüne 1936 ein 80 Yards (73,15 Meter) langes Dach, zwei Jahre später kamen Dächer über die zwei südlichen Ecken hinzu. Als der Zweite Weltkrieg ausbrach, requirierte das Militär das Stadion, um es als Lager zu verwenden. Fußball wurde weiterhin gespielt, bis ein deutscher Luftangriff auf das benachbarte Industriegebiet Trafford Park am 22. Dezember 1940 das Stadion so weit beschädigte, dass das geplante Weihnachtsspiel gegen Stockport County ins Stadion der Gastmannschaft verlegt werden musste. Nach Beseitigung der Schäden konnte der Spielbetrieb am 8. März 1941 wieder aufgenommen werden, doch ein weiterer deutscher Angriff am 11. März zerstörte das Stadion zu einem großen Teil (insbesondere die Haupttribüne). Manchester United war gezwungen, seinen Sitz in das Colnbrook-Kühllager zu verlegen, das dem Vereinsvorsitzenden James W. Gibson gehörte.', 'Auf Druck von Gibson gewährte die Kriegsschädenkommission \\"(War Damages Commission)\\" dem Verein eine Entschädigung von 4.800 Pfund für die Beseitigung der Trümmer und weitere 17.478 Pfund für den Wiederaufbau der Tribüne. Während des Wiederaufbaus des Stadions trug Manchester United seine Heimspiele an der Maine Road aus, dem Stadion des Stadtrivalen Manchester City. Der Verein musste jährlich 5.000 Pfund Miete bezahlen und einen Anteil an den Zuschauereinnahmen abgeben. Manchester United hatte nun Schulden in der Höhe von 15.000 Pfund und konnte diese aufgrund der erhöhten Kosten kaum abtragen. Der Unterhaus-Abgeordnete Ellis Smith von der Labour Party ersuchte die Regierung vergeblich um eine Aufstockung der Entschädigung für den Verein. Mehr als acht Jahre nach der Zerstörung konnte das Old Trafford wieder genutzt werden. Das erste Spiel im wiederhergestellten Stadion fand am 24. August 1949 statt, als 41.748 Zuschauer den 3:0-Sieg des Heimteams gegen die Bolton Wanderers mitverfolgten.', 'Umbauten nach dem Wiedereinzug.', '1951 war das Dach über der Haupttribüne wiederhergestellt und bald darauf erhielten auch die drei übrigen Tribünen eine Überdachung, zuletzt 1959 die Westtribüne. Der Verein investierte 40.000 Pfund in eine angemessene Flutlichtanlage, um das Stadion auch abends unter der Woche für europäische Pokalspiele nutzen zu können und somit das Ausweichen an die Maine Road zu vermeiden. Um störende Schattenwürfe auf dem Spielfeld zu vermeiden, wurden zwei Abschnitte des Haupttribünendachs entfernt. Das erste Spiel unter Flutlicht war eine Meisterschaftspartie zwischen Manchester United und den Bolton Wanderers am 25. März 1957.', 'Obwohl die Zuschauer die Spieler nun auch abends sehen konnten, bestand noch immer das Problem, dass die Stützpfeiler das Sichtfeld einschränkten. Die bevorstehende Fußball-Weltmeisterschaft 1966 veranlasste die Vereinsführung dazu, die Nordtribüne an der United Road vollständig neu zu gestalten. Die alten Stützpfeiler wurden 1965 durch moderne Auskragungen auf dem Dach ersetzt, was sämtlichen Zuschauern einen uneingeschränkten Blick auf das Spielgeschehen ermöglichte. Bei Kosten von 350.000 Pfund erweiterte man die Tribünenkapazität auf 20.000 Zuschauer (je zur Hälfte Sitz- und Stehplätze). Das zuständige Architekturbüro \\"Mather and Nutter\\" gestaltete die Tribüne so um, dass sich vorne der terrassierte Stehplatzbereich befand und dahinter der größere Sitzplatzbereich, mit den ersten VIP-Logen in einem britischen Fußballstadion. Die Osttribüne, die einzige noch nicht überdachte, wurde 1973 im selben Stil umgestaltet.', 'Nachdem nun zwei Tribünen mit Auskragungen versehen worden waren, erarbeiteten die Vereinsbesitzer einen langfristigen Plan, um auch die zwei übrigen Tribünen umzubauen und das Stadion in eine schüsselartige Arena zu verwandeln. Sie erhofften sich dadurch, den Lärm der Menge auf das Spielfeld zu fokussieren, was zu einer besseren Stimmung beitragen würde. Da das Endspiel des FA Cup 1970 unentschieden geendet hatte, wurde am 29. April 1970 eine Wiederholung im Old Trafford angesetzt; Chelsea gewann das Spiel gegen Leeds United vor 62.078 Zuschauern mit 2:1.: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Old Trafford, Manchester United, Fußballstadion, Greater Manchester, Archibald Leitch, Umbauarbeiten, Rugby League, Länderspiele, Kapazität, Geschichte"},{"prompt":"sxdx","completion":"I'm sorry, as an AI language model, I do not understand what \\"sxdx\\" means.

Er fliegt als Wanderfalter auch nach Europa ein und zählt auf Grund seiner Spannweite von bis zu 12 Zentimetern zu den größten hier vorkommenden Schwärmern. Anders als die ebenso weit aus dem Süden einfliegenden Totenkopfschwärmer und Linienschwärmer ist die Art aber nördlich der Alpen ein sehr seltener Gast. Wegen seiner prächtigen Färbung wird er zu den eindrucksvollsten Schwärmerarten gezählt.', 'Merkmale.', 'Falter.', 'Die männlichen Falter erreichen eine Flügelspannweite von 70 bis 100 Millimetern, die Weibchen werden mit 95 bis 120 Millimetern etwas größer. Der Flügelumriss unterscheidet sich nicht von dem anderer Arten der Gattung und ist ganzrandig, die Flügelspitze läuft spitz zu. Die Flügel werden von einem in feinen Abstufungen olivgrün bis grün gefärbten Muster dominiert, wobei die Temperaturen während der Puppenruhe Einfluss auf die Ausbildung und Intensität der Farbtöne des Falters haben. Bei Temperaturen um etwa 21 °C wird überwiegend ein kräftiges Grün, bei hohen Temperaturen jenseits der 26 °C dagegen ein Olivgrün entwickelt. Das Muster besteht aus geschwungenen grünen Flecken, an die unterschiedlich ausgefärbte cremefarbene bis blass rosarote Bänder angrenzen, deren Färbung ebenso variiert. Ein dominantes Band vom Flügelansatz etwa zum Außenrand des Vorderflügels ist meist intensiver rosa getönt. Zwischen der Mitte und dem Innenwinkel der Vorderflügel liegt ein dunkel bräunlich bis blauvioletter Fleck. ', 'Die Hinterflügel sind größtenteils ebenso wie dieser gefärbt. Der Teil, der in Ruhestellung nicht von den Vorderflügeln bedeckt ist, sowie ein mehr oder weniger ausgedehnter Bereich entlang des Flügelaußenrandes zeigen dagegen die gleiche grüne Färbung wie die Vorderflügel. In der hinteren Flügelhälfte verläuft eine feine, geschwungene, cremefarbene Binde. Bei der forma \\"nigra\\" ist die komplette Grünfärbung der Falter durch Schwarztöne ersetzt. ', 'Der Thorax ist grün behaart, wobei die Grünfärbung nach vorne breiter wird und in der Mitte einem cremefarbenen, behaarten Dreieck weicht, dessen Basis mit dem hinteren Ende des Metathorax abschließt. Der Hinterleib besitzt eine ähnliche Färbung und Musterung wie die Vorderflügel. Eine markante, helle Binde verbindet die beiden intensiv gefärbten Bänder der Vorderflügel. Die Beine sind ebenso wie die etwa 14 bis 17 Millimeter langen, fadenförmigen Fühler cremegelb.', 'Ei.', 'Die Eier des Oleanderschwärmers sind hellgrün, nahezu kugelig und haben eine sehr fein gekörnte Oberfläche. Sie sind mit 1,5 Millimeter Höhe und 1,25 Millimeter Breite im Verhältnis zur Größe des ausgewachsenen Falters unproportional klein.', 'Raupe.', 'Die Raupen erreichen eine Körperlänge von 90 bis 130 Millimetern. Beim Schlupf sind sie drei bis vier Millimeter lang, leuchtend gelb und besitzen ein proportional sehr langes, dünnes, dunkel gefärbtes Analhorn. Schon kurz nach Beginn der Nahrungsaufnahme beginnt die Umfärbung. Bis zur ersten Häutung erreichen die Raupen eine Länge von fünf bis acht Millimetern und haben ihre Farbe über grüngelb nach bläulichgrün gewechselt. Ihr Analhorn ist nun etwa 2,5 Millimeter lang und schwarz gefärbt, die Stigmen sind ebenfalls schwarz, die Thorakalbeine rosa. Das Analhorn besitzt am letzten Drittel eine für Schwärmerraupen ungewöhnliche mützenförmige Ausbuchtung, die erst im vorletzten Raupenstadium verschwindet. ', 'Vor der zweiten Häutung haben die Raupen eine Körperlänge von 8,5 bis 15 Millimetern und eine hell bläulichgrüne Färbung. Am dritten Thoraxsegment sind beidseits bereits die zwei hellen, dunkel gesäumten Augenflecken erkennbar. Das vierte Segment besitzt keine, die acht darauffolgenden Segmente je zwei bis sechs kleine, helle, runde Punkte. Das 4,5 bis 4,8 Millimeter lange Analhorn zeigt an der Spitze ein oder zwei helle Höckerchen, an denen Haare entspringen. ', 'Während des dritten Raupenstadiums verfärbt sich der nun 20 bis 25 Millimeter lange Körper der Tiere grün bis gelbgrün, die zwei Paar Augenflecken am dritten Thoraxsegment sind groß und bläulich gerandet. Auf den übrigen Segmenten bilden kleine, blau gerandete helle Punkte eine zusammenhängende Kette, ausgenommen auf dem letzten Segment. Das nun etwa sieben Millimeter lange Analhorn trägt erst ab diesem Stadium häufig eine weiße Spitze. ', 'Nach der nächsten Häutung erreichen die Raupen eine Körperlänge von 26 bis 40 Millimetern. Sie sind ebenfalls grün bis gelbgrün gefärbt, in diesem Stadium kann sich aber auch eine bräunliche Färbung ausbilden. Die beiden Augenfleckpaare am dritten Thoraxsegment sind nun außen zusätzlich dunkel gerandet und verschmelzen gelegentlich. Entlang der Seiten des Körpers verläuft eine gelbe Längslinie, über der weiße Punkte verstreut sind und unter der die kleinen weißen, blau gerandeten Punkte in einer Reihe sitzen. Die erste Hälfte des dünnen, 8,5 bis 9,5 Millimeter langen Analhorns ist nun gelblichweiß gefärbt, die zweite ist rein weiß oder farblos.', 'Im fünften und letzten Raupenstadium erreichen die Tiere ihre eingangs beschriebene Länge. Die Grundfärbung ist nun grün oder braun, wobei der Rücken etwas dunkler gefärbt ist. Gelegentlich besitzt der Rücken einen rosa Schimmer. Beidseits des Rückens verläuft eine weiße Längslinie, an die zur Bauchseite hin ein bläulicher Schimmer angrenzt. Innerhalb dieses blauen Bereichs befinden sich längs aneinandergereihte, kreisrunde, weiß gefärbte und blau gerandete Punkte. Zusätzlich befinden sich oberhalb der weißen Längslinie weitere, ungerandete weiße Punkte. Am dritten Thoraxsegment befinden sich auf jeder Seite des Rückens zwei weiße, blau und außen schwarz gerandete, auffällige Augenflecken, die meist mehr oder weniger ineinander verschmelzen. Das plumpe, nun nur vier bis fünf Millimeter lange Analhorn ist orange und hat eine schwarze Spitze. Es ist gepustelt und nach hinten unten gekrümmt. Die Stigmen sind schwarz. Die Thorakalbeine sind rötlichbraun bis bläulich, die Bauchbeine besitzen die Körpergrundfarbe. Manchmal ist die Grundfarbe der Raupen im letzten Stadium bronzefarben, wobei die ersten Körpersegmente rosa gefärbt sind. Die übrigen Merkmale sind dann identisch mit denen der anderen Raupenstadien. Selten kann man auch bernsteinfarbene oder blass ockergelbe Raupen mit purpurrot gerandeten Augenflecken finden.', 'Puppe.', 'An der 60 bis 75 Millimeter messenden, schlanken Puppe kann man zahlreiche Körperdetails des späteren Falters gut erkennen. Der Kopf, Thorax, die Flügelscheiden, Seiten und der Bauch des Hinterleibs sind blassorange, der Rücken des Hinterleibs ist rotbraun gefärbt und besitzt schwarze Sprenkel. Auch die Flügelscheiden besitzen gelegentlich solche Sprenkel. Die Oberfläche der Puppe ist glänzend, der Kopf, Thorax und die Flügelscheiden sind glatt, der Hinterleib ist am Rücken grob gekörnt, wobei das 12. bis 14. Segment auch am Bauch eng gekörnt ist. Diese Einkerbungen formen ungleichmäßige Linien, am Bauch verlaufen diese schräg. Der entrollte Saugrüssel ist als schwarze Linie entlang dem Kopf und Thorax gut zu erkennen. Am Rücken des zweiten bis vierten Körpersegmentes befindet sich zudem ein etwas breiterer schwarzer Streifen. Der kleine, gerade und kegelförmige Kremaster ist schwarz und endet in zwei abgestumpften Zähnchen. Auch die Stigmen sind schwarz und jeweils von einem schwarzen Fleck umgeben. Der Kopf der Puppe ist breit abgerundet; die Schultern treten nicht markant hervor. Auch die Facettenaugen sind gut erkennbar und besitzen eine sichelförmige dunkle Markierung. Die Fühlerscheiden sind etwas kürzer als die Vorderbeine. ', 'Ähnliche Arten.', 'Der Oleanderschwärmer kann mit \\"Daphnis hypothous\\" aus Indien und Südostasien verwechselt werden, welcher sehr selten auch im Westen der Paläarktis als Wanderfalter zu beobachten ist. \\"D. hypothous\\" besitzt ein sehr ähnliches Muster, allerdings mit schwarzer Grundfarbe, weswegen ihm insbesondere die forma \\"nigra\\" sehr ähnelt. Sicheres Unterscheidungsmerkmal ist ein weißer runder Fleck an den Vorderflügelspitzen, der dem Oleanderschwärmer fehlt.', 'Lebensweise.', 'Die nachtaktiven Oleanderschwärmer fliegen nach Sonnenuntergang bis vor Sonnenaufgang. Sie saugen Nektar von verschiedenen Pflanzen, wie etwa von Tabak (\\"Nicotiana\\"), Petunien (\\"Petunia\\"), Heckenkirschen bzw. Geißblättern (\\"Lonicera\\"), Seifenkräutern (\\"Saponaria\\") und Wunderblumen (\\"Mirabilis\\"), wobei pro Nahrungssuche etwa 0,4 bis 0,8 Milliliter Nektar aufgenommen werden. Neben Nektar wird auch Wasser von Tau- und Regentropfen gesogen. Der Oleanderschwärmer lässt sich anders als der ähnliche \\"D. hypothous\\" nur selten durch künstliches Licht anlocken. ', 'Die Falter ruhen tagsüber entweder auf festem Untergrund oder hängen gut getarnt zwischen Blattwerk. Der Kopf wird dabei eingezogen, Thorax und Hinterleib werden vom Untergrund weggestreckt. Sind die Temperaturen günstig, sind die Falter sehr schreckhaft und fliegen bei Störungen auch tagsüber. Der Lebenszyklus der Art ist an die klimatischen Bedingungen und Tageslängen in den Tropen angepasst. Sie bevorzugen ganzjährig Temperaturen knapp unter 30 °C und eine Sonnenscheindauer von idealerweise 12, maximal 14,5 Stunden pro Tag. ', 'Wanderflüge und Flugzeiten der Falter.', 'Der Oleanderschwärmer ist ein Wanderfalter, der jedoch nicht überall auf der Welt Wanderungen unternimmt, was darauf schließen lässt, dass der Wandertrieb nicht genetisch festgelegt ist, sondern durch Umweltfaktoren bedingt ist. Dies zeigt sich gut an der auf Hawaii eingeschleppten Population. Diese konnte sich innerhalb von nur zwei Jahren auf der Inselkette etablieren, auf der ideale Temperaturen um die 28 °C und Tageslängen zwischen 12 und maximal 14,5 Stunden herrschen. Unter Umweltfaktoren, die eine Wanderung bedingen, wäre eine Ansiedlung nicht erfolgreich gewesen, da die Inselgruppe geografisch isoliert und die Entfernung zum Festland zu groß ist, sodass die abwandernden Falter nicht mehr zurückkehren könnten und die Population erlöschen würde.

März 1989 bis zum 24. Januar 1991 zunächst als Regierung von West-Berlin und nach der deutschen Wiedervereinigung am 3. Oktober 1990 gemeinsam mit dem Ostberliner Magistrat Schwierzina als Regierung des neuen Landes Berlin. Nach dem überraschenden Wahlsieg bei der Wahl zum Abgeordnetenhaus am 29. Januar 1989 löste die rot-grüne Koalition zwischen den Berliner Sozialdemokraten (SPD) und der Alternativen Liste für Demokratie und Umweltschutz (AL) die bisherige CDU/FDP-Regierung unter Eberhard Diepgen ab. Regierender Bürgermeister wurde Walter Momper (SPD). Das SPD/AL-Bündnis war nach dem Kabinett Börner III in Hessen (1985 bis 1987) die zweite rot-grüne Landesregierung in Deutschland. Der Fall der Berliner Mauer bedeutete eine Zäsur sowohl für Berlin als auch in der zwanzigmonatigen Amtszeit des Senats. Ab der Vereinigung Deutschlands und Berlins amtierte der Senat Momper mehr als drei Monate lang gemeinsam mit dem Magistrat Schwierzina als Gesamtberliner Regierung. Nach andauernden Konflikten stieg die AL am 15. November 1990, zwei Wochen vor ohnehin angesetzten Neuwahlen des Abgeordnetenhauses, aus der Koalition aus. Anlass war eine von Innensenator Erich Pätzold (SPD) veranlasste Räumung von besetzten Häusern in der Mainzer Straße. Bei der ersten Gesamtberliner Wahl zum Abgeordnetenhaus am 2. Dezember 1990 erlitten sowohl die SPD als auch die AL schwere Verluste.', 'Voraussetzungen.', 'Der CDU/FDP-Senat unter Eberhard Diepgen.', 'In der ehemaligen SPD-Hochburg West-Berlin stellte die CDU seit 1975 die stärkste Fraktion im Abgeordnetenhaus und seit 1981 den Regierenden Bürgermeister. Die Sozialdemokraten, die bei der Wahl 1963 mit 61,9 Prozent ihr zweitbestes Ergebnis in der Berliner Nachkriegsgeschichte erzielen konnten, hatten seit dieser Wahl bei annähernd jedem Urnengang Verluste erlitten. Nachdem Richard von Weizsäcker 1984 zum Bundespräsidenten gewählt worden war, regierte Eberhard Diepgen einen CDU/FDP-Senat. Diepgen, der als wenig charismatischer Technokrat und Strippenzieher galt, war bei den Wahlen zum Berliner Abgeordnetenhaus vom 10. März 1985 klar bestätigt worden. Im Abgeordnetenhaus war die CDU mit 69 Mandaten vertreten, die SPD erhielt 48, die Alternative Liste 15 und die FDP 12 Sitze.', 'Über die gesamte 10. Legislaturperiode zog sich die Aufdeckung des Antes-Skandals hin. Bis zum Regierungswechsel 1981 war es die SPD gewesen, die von der Garski-Affäre über die Kreisel-Affäre und andere im sogenannten „roten Sumpf“ oder „Berliner Filz“ steckte. Am Beziehungsgeflecht zwischen öffentlicher Hand und Privatwirtschaft in der Inselstadt hatte jedoch auch Richard von Weizsäcker nichts ändern können, der in seiner Regierungserklärung das etablierte System der Vorteilnahme und Ämterpatronage noch heftig als „Beutepolitik der Parteien“ kritisiert hatte. Im Gegenteil verfestigte sich das Korruptionssystem unter der CDU-Regierung noch. Das persönliche, überaus enge Netzwerk einer Gruppe von hochrangigen CDU-Politikern, auf dem Diepgens Position beruhte, erwies sich nun als Teil dieses Systems. CDU-Bausenator Klaus Franke und FDP-Umweltsenator Horst Vetter mussten ihre Hüte nehmen, Innensenator Heinrich Lummer sein Amt zudem wegen einer früheren Zusammenarbeit mit der NPD aufgeben. Die CDU bagatellisierte den Skandal und sah sich in der Rolle eines Opfers einer „Schmutz- und Schundkampagne“.', 'Wahlkampf.', 'Allen Skandalen zum Trotz war Diepgen in Berlin relativ populär, auch wenn er als eher blass galt und weit entfernt davon war, eine ähnliche Verehrung zu genießen wie etwa von Weizsäcker, Willy Brandt oder Ernst Reuter. Verschiedene Umfragen ergaben, dass sich zwischen den Spitzenkandidaten Eberhard Diepgen und Walter Momper etwa 60 Prozent der Berliner für Diepgen entschieden hätten, wenn sie den Regierenden Bürgermeister direkt hätten wählen können. Er profitierte von einer dichten Reihe von Großveranstaltungen anlässlich der 750-Jahr-Feier 1987 sowie als West-Berlin 1988 als Kulturstadt Europas fungierte, die die politischen Probleme Berlins und die Affären der CDU zu überstrahlen schienen. So setzte die CDU ganz auf den Bürgermeisterbonus. Die meisten Wahlplakate zeigten ein Porträt des Regierenden Bürgermeisters mit dem Wahlkampfslogan „Ihn braucht Berlin“, später „Ihn will Berlin“.', 'Die SPD vermied es dagegen, die Wahl zu personalisieren, und stellte ihren Spitzenkandidaten Walter Momper, Fraktionsvorsitzender der SPD seit März 1985 und Parteivorsitzender seit Juni 1986, im Wahlkampf nicht besonders heraus. Sie konzentrierte sich auf traditionell sozialdemokratisch besetzte Politikfelder. Ab 1987 begannen Kampagnen zur Mietpreisbindung, zur Gestaltung des Flächennutzungsplans, zur Gleichstellung der Frauen und gegen die Gesundheitspolitik der Bonner CDU/FDP-Koalition.', 'Der Wahlkampf wurde, je näher der Wahltag heranrückte, immer inhaltsleerer. Die Parolen auf den Wahlplakaten wirkten austauschbar und teilweise unverständlich: „Frohes neues Berlin“ (CDU), „Berlin ist Freiheit“ (SPD) oder „Ein frohes 1993“ (FDP). Lediglich die AL griff offensiv Themen auf, die der Bevölkerung wichtig waren, vertraute jedoch auf das alternative Milieu und scheute kostenträchtige Werbemaßnahmen. Kurz vor der Wahl polarisierte und polemisierte die erstmals antretende rechtsextreme Partei Die Republikaner mit ausländerfeindlichen und autoritär akzentuierten Fernsehspots sowie mit einer Veranstaltung, die von dem Bundesvorsitzenden Franz Schönhuber dominiert und von heftigen Gegendemonstrationen begleitet wurde.', 'Die Haltung von SPD und AL zu einer rot-grünen Koalition vor der Wahl.', 'Da in der Bundesrepublik der Ansehensverlust der CDU/FDP-Bundesregierung unter Helmut Kohl scheinbar unaufhaltsam voranschritt, sich eine Wechselstimmung abzeichnete und eine rot-grüne Mehrheit bei der Bundestagswahl im Dezember 1990 möglich schien, hätte eine SPD/AL-Regierung in Berlin als Testfall für eine rot-grüne Bundesregierung dienen können. Weil es vor der Wahl aber nahezu unvorstellbar erschien, dass die SPD und die Alternative Liste die etwa zwölf Prozentpunkte Rückstand auf die CDU/FDP-Regierung würden aufholen können, gingen die AL und mehr noch die Sozialdemokraten in den Wahlkampf, ohne eine mögliche gemeinsame Koalition ernsthaft geprüft zu haben.', 'Angesichts des prognostizierten Wahlausgangs fiel es der SPD leicht, ein Bündnis mit der AL auszuschließen und so verschreckte Wähler zu beruhigen. Die AL hatte sich dagegen dazu durchgerungen, ihre Bereitschaft zur Zusammenarbeit mit den Sozialdemokraten zu erklären, nachdem sie noch im Vorfeld der Wahl zum Abgeordnetenhaus 1985 eine mögliche Koalition oder auch nur eine Tolerierung abgelehnt hatte. Die besondere Insellage West-Berlins hatte zu einem Sonderweg der AL gegenüber den Bundes-Grünen geführt. So war sie besonders stark im links-alternativen Spektrum der Stadt angesiedelt, klassische Umweltschützer hatten dagegen keine besondere Rolle gespielt. Zudem war die AL formal von der Bundespartei unabhängig, auch wenn sie die Rolle eines Landesverbandes übernahm. Die Auseinandersetzungen zwischen den auf Regierungsbeteiligungen abzielenden Realos und den auf fundamentale Opposition setzenden Fundis, die die Bundespartei in den 1980er Jahren beherrschten und zu spalten drohten, spielten in der AL niemals eine so bedeutende Rolle. Stattdessen galt die AL als relativ homogener, dabei dezidiert linker Landesverband, der basisdemokratischen Entscheidungsprozessen einen ganz besonders hohen Stellenwert einräumte.', 'Umfragen vor der Wahl.', 'Trotz der Bedrängnis der Berliner CDU durch den Antes-Skandal prognostizierten Umfragen der CDU/FDP-Koalition noch knapp drei Wochen vor dem Wahltag eine deutliche Mehrheit. Erst wenige Tage vor der Wahl deutete sich ein Kopf-an-Kopf-Rennen zwischen den politischen Lagern an, allerdings immer noch mit einer schwarz-gelben Mehrheit und einem klaren Vorsprung der CDU vor der SPD.', 'Einer Infas-Umfrage im Auftrag des SFB-Magazins \\"Kontraste\\" zufolge war für 24 Prozent der Befragten die Situation auf dem Arbeitsmarkt das wichtigste Thema, für 23 Prozent der Umweltschutz und für 20 Prozent der Wohnungsbau.', 'Zwei Wochen zuvor hatte eine vom \\"Stern\\" beauftragte Umfrage ergeben, dass Mieten und Wohnungsnot an erster Stelle standen, darauf folgten die Themen Ausländer und Uni-Überfüllung.', 'Wahl zum Abgeordnetenhaus am 29. Januar 1989.', 'Die Wahl zum Abgeordnetenhaus am 29. Januar 1989 sorgte in mehrfacher Hinsicht für Überraschungen: Die CDU, deren Sieg als sicher gegolten hatte, erlitt eine schwere Niederlage und brach mit 37,7 Prozent der Stimmen um 8,7 Prozentpunkte ein. Die SPD legte dagegen um 4,9 Prozentpunkte auf 37,3 Prozent zu und erzielte mit 55 Parlamentssitzen ebenso viele Mandate wie die CDU. Zusammen mit der ebenfalls gestärkten Alternativen Liste (11,8 Prozent, +1,2 Prozentpunkte) ergab dies eine deutliche Mehrheit für Rot-Grün, da mit der FDP – ebenfalls überraschend – der bisherige Koalitionspartner der CDU mit 3,9 Prozent (−4,6 Prozentpunkte) klar den Wiedereinzug ins Abgeordnetenhaus verfehlte. Das dritte in keiner Weise vorher prognostizierte und mit Erschrecken zur Kenntnis genommene Ergebnis war der Einzug der Republikaner, die auf Anhieb 7,5 Prozent der Stimmen und somit elf Sitze erhielten.', 'Koalitionsbildung.', 'Koalitionsverhandlungen.', 'Noch am Wahlabend lehnte Walter Momper ein erneutes Angebot der Alternativen Liste zur Zusammenarbeit mit der Bemerkung ab, diese sei „nicht regierungsfähig“. So zeichnete sich direkt nach der Wahl eine große Koalition ab. Andererseits hatten die SPD und die AL bei kräftigen Zugewinnen eine deutliche Mehrheit erzielt, während die bisher regierende Koalition klar abgewählt worden war. Ein SPD/CDU-Bündnis als einzige Alternative zu dem mit der AL hatte deshalb keine Mehrheit an der SPD-Basis, zumal Umfragen besagten, dass nur 17,2 Prozent der Berliner eine solche Regierung wünschten, während sich 23,9 Prozent für Rot-Grün aussprachen.', 'Nach einigen Tagen kam es zu informellen Gesprächen, an denen auf Seiten der SPD Walter Momper, der Kreuzberger Bezirksbürgermeister Gerd Wartenberg und der frühere Landesvorsitzende Jürgen Egert sowie für die Alternative Liste Bernd Köppl,: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"1.

Nach den Olympischen Spielen wurde das Stadion von 1972 bis 2005 hauptsächlich als Heimstätte des FC Bayern München und mit Unterbrechungen vom TSV 1860 München genutzt, der zwischen der vorherigen Heimstätte der beiden Vereine, dem Städtischen Stadion an der Grünwalder Straße, und dem Olympiastadion pendelte. 2005 zogen die Vereine in die neu erbaute Allianz Arena um. Neben den Spielen dieser Fußballvereine fanden auch weitere Profispiele im Olympiastadion statt. Dort wurden unter anderem die Endspiele der Fußball-Weltmeisterschaft 1974 und der Fußball-Europameisterschaft 1988 sowie mehrere Endspiele der UEFA Champions League und ihres Vorgängerwettbewerbs ausgetragen.', 'Seit 1982 ist das Olympiastadion die größte Bühne Münchens und wird für Open-Air-Konzerte genutzt. Neben Public-Viewing-Veranstaltungen finden seit dem Auszug der Fußballvereine hauptsächlich Konzerte im Stadion statt. Daneben gab es dort zahlreiche andere Veranstaltungen, darunter die Leichtathletik-Europameisterschaften 2002 und 2022, Show-Rennen der DTM in den Jahren 2011 und 2012.', 'Das Olympiastadion ist zu zwei Dritteln ein Erdstadion und verfügte neben einem Fußballfeld über eine Leichtathletiklaufbahn. Die Oberfläche besteht aus einer Naturrasenfläche. Die Arena war deutschlandweit das erste Stadion, das mit einer Rasenheizung sowie einem VIP-Bereich ausgestattet war, und es verfügte weltweit über das modernste Stadionflutlicht, mit dem Tageslicht simuliert werden kann. Die Zeltdachkonstruktion überspannt neben dem Stadion auch die Olympiahalle, die Olympia-Schwimmhalle sowie die dazwischenliegenden Wege. Dadurch soll das Stadion Leichtigkeit, Transparenz und Offenheit symbolisieren. Es zählt zu den wichtigsten Bauten der bundesdeutschen Nachkriegsarchitektur und gilt als ein Wahrzeichen Münchens. Wie die anderen Bauten unter dem Zeltdach steht das Olympiastadion seit 1997 unter Denkmalschutz.', 'Lage und Anbindung.', 'Das Olympiastadion ist in den Olympiapark eingebettet, der auf dem Oberwiesenfeld im Münchner Stadtbezirk Milbertshofen-Am Hart errichtet wurde. Der drei Quadratkilometer große Park befindet sich vier Kilometer nordwestlich des Münchner Stadtzentrums. Zum Zeitpunkt der Fertigstellung war er, auch wegen des Olympiastadions, der größte Sportpark der Bundesrepublik Deutschland. Das Stadion bildet gemeinsam mit der benachbarten Olympiahalle und der Olympia-Schwimmhalle das Herzstück der Münchner Olympiaanlagen unter derselben Zeltdachkonstruktion. Alle drei Sportstätten grenzen an den Coubertinplatz, den Mittelpunkt der Olympiaanlage. Auf der Südseite des Coubertinplatzes liegt der Olympiasee. Er befindet sich 20 Meter unter dem Zentralplateau des Coubertinplatzes. Das Stadion ist am Westhang des Plateaus angelegt.', 'Nördlich des Stadions befindet sich das olympische Dorf, das wegen des Mittleren Rings, der zwischen beiden Anlagen hindurchführt, lediglich über Brücken von der Arena aus direkt zu erreichen ist. 200 Meter nordöstlich des Stadions steht die Olympiahalle. Sie ist an der schmalsten Stelle acht Meter von der Olympia-Schwimmhalle entfernt, die östlich vom Olympiastadion liegt. Olympia-Schwimmhalle, Olympiahalle, Olympiastadion und Olympiasee bilden die Außengrenzen des Coubertinplatzes. Noch weiter östlich von der Schwimmhalle bildet der Olympiaturm gemeinsam mit den Anlagen am Coubertinplatz den Bereich der charakterbestimmenden Merkmale des Olympiaparks. Die Formen des gesamten Geländes ergänzen sich durch bauliche Strukturen gegenseitig zu einer Architekturlandschaft.', 'Das Olympiastadion verfügt für den Individualverkehr über zwei Parkplätze in der nahe gelegenen Parkharfe westlich des Stadions bei der Landshuter Allee oder nahe der Olympiahalle. Die Arena befindet sich wenige Meter südlich des Georg-Brauchle-Rings. Neben zwei Eingängen am Coubertinplatz gibt es Zugänge am Spiridon-Louis-Ring, der von Norden her über Westen und Süden einen Halbring um das Olympiastadion bildet.', 'Zeitgleich zum Stadionbau wurden zahlreiche Anbindungen an den öffentlichen Personennahverkehr eingerichtet: In der Nähe des olympischen Dorfes befindet sich der U-Bahnhof Olympiazentrum mit den dort verkehrenden U-Bahn-Linien U3 und U8, der außerdem von einer Buslinie bedient wird. Während der Olympischen Spiele und anschließend bis 1988 wurde bei Großveranstaltungen der Bahnhof München Olympiastadion im Westen des Oberwiesenfelds durch die Münchner S-Bahn mit einer Sonderlinie angefahren. Beide Bahnhöfe liegen etwa einen Kilometer vom Stadion entfernt und hatten ursprünglich eine Stundenkapazität von 30.000 Fahrgästen. Das Stadion ist auch durch weitere Haltestellen am Olympiapark mit Straßenbahnen und Bussen erreichbar.', 'Geschichte.', 'Frühe Gedanken über ein Großstadion.', 'Bereits nach dem Ersten Weltkrieg gab es erste Überlegungen, ein Großstadion in München zu errichten, da Fußball an Popularität gewann. Ein Stadionbau am Oberwiesenfeld scheiterte 1919 am Einspruch des bayerischen Staates. 1921 entstand dort der Teutonia-Platz, der bis zum Ausbau des Stadions an der Grünwalder Straße 1926 der modernste Sportplatz Münchens war. Er wurde vom Verein FC Teutonia eröffnet und bot 12.000 Zuschauern Platz. Im Monat nach der Eröffnung kamen dort rund 20.000 Gäste zu einem Spiel, womit die erlaubte Kapazität um zwei Drittel überzogen wurde. Der FC Bayern nutzte von 1923 bis 1925 den Teutonia-Platz für seine Heimspiele. Der TSV 1860 bespielte bereits seit 1911 das zur damaligen Zeit vereinseigene Stadion an der Grünwalder Straße in Giesing, das seit dem Ausbau auf eine Kapazität von 40.000 Zuschauern das größte Stadion Münchens war.', 'Die Kapazität war zwar für den Meisterschaftsbetrieb ausreichend, allerdings stieß das Stadion bei Länderspielen an seine Grenzen: Das Spiel Deutschland gegen die Schweiz 1926 zeigte, dass bei Großereignissen ein weitaus höheres Interesse bestand, als Karten verkauft werden durften. Auch die 1928 eröffnete Kampfbahn an der Dantestraße entsprach nicht den Vorstellungen von einem Großstadion. Aus diesem Grund wurde in der Weimarer Republik der Bau eines Großstadions am Rande Münchens, beispielsweise am Oberwiesenfeld, diskutiert, jedoch ergebnislos.', 'Zu Beginn des Nationalsozialismus planten Lokalpolitiker der NSDAP den Bau eines 60.000 bis 80.000 Zuschauer fassenden Stadions westlich des Flughafens München-Riem. Dies sollte dem Reichssportfeld in Berlin entsprechen. Die Flughafenverwaltung wehrte sich jedoch gegen den Bau, und auch der Generalbaurat Münchens setzte sich ein Großstadion nicht als Ziel. Mit dem Ausbruch des Zweiten Weltkriegs wurden die Pläne endgültig verworfen.', 'Nach Kriegsende strömten die Menschenmassen erneut in die Stadien, um sich an Wochenenden mit Fußballspielen zu unterhalten, so auch in München. 1948 besuchten bei einem Spiel des TSV 1860 gegen den 1. FC Nürnberg rund 58.200 Zuschauer das für 45.000 Besucher ausgerichtete Stadion an der Grünwalder Straße. Ein Jahr später kamen zu dem in München ausgetragenen Halbfinalspiel der Deutschen Meisterschaft zwischen dem 1. FC Kaiserslautern und Borussia Dortmund 57.000 Zuschauer. Die Nachkriegszeit gilt heute als „goldenes Zeitalter“ des Fußballs; erst seit den 1990er-Jahren kommen erneut so viele Besucher in die deutschen Stadien.', 'Das im Krieg zerstörte Grünwalder Stadion bot nach der Renovierung Platz für 50.000 Zuschauer und war damit das größte Stadion Münchens. Der städtische Sportausschuss befand die Kapazität jedoch für zu gering und strebte dessen Ausbau auf ein Fassungsvermögen von 75.000 Zuschauern an. Gegenwind erhielt der Sportausschuss von lokalen Medien. So sprach sich der \\"Münchner Merkur\\" Anfang 1951 für den Neubau eines Stadions am Oberwiesenfeld aus, nachdem die ausgebaute Tribüne des Grünwalder Stadions den Bau des geplanten Mittleren Rings als Hauptzufahrtstraße zur Bundesautobahn 8 erschwert hätte. Das Großstadionprojekt fand mit der Verabschiedung des sogenannten Zehn-Jahres-Programms am 10. März 1955, das den Bau von Bezirkssportanlagen förderte, vorerst ein Ende.', 'Ein weiterer Grund für diese Entscheidung war die gesunkene Attraktivität des Fußballs in München, da die ehemals erfolgreichen Stadtvereine wie TSV 1860, FC Wacker und FC Bayern mit ihren Leistungen in das Mittelmaß abfielen. Spiele der deutschen Nationalmannschaft fanden wegen der geringen Kapazität des Grünwalder Stadions bereits seit 1940 nicht mehr in München statt. Für die großen Stadtvereine blieb die Kapazität des Grünwalder Stadions mit Ausnahme der Lokalderbys, zu denen teilweise mehr Zuschauer kamen, als das Stadion offiziell Platz bot, ausreichend.', '1958 ließ die Bayernpartei erneut das Thema eines Großstadions aufleben. Sowohl der FC Bayern als auch der TSV 1860 sträubten sich gegen das Vorhaben, da sie befürchteten, dass die Kapazität nicht ausgeschöpft werden würde und das Projekt sie in den Ruin treiben könnte. 1963, in der letzten Saison vor der Einführung der Fußball-Bundesliga, gewann der TSV 1860 die Oberliga-Meisterschaft und sicherte sich damit vor dem Lokalrivalen FC Bayern den Startplatz für die erste Liga in der Folgesaison. In der ersten Bundesligasaison hatte der TSV 1860 durchschnittlich knapp 32.000 Zuschauer pro Spiel, was den Durchschnitt der Vorjahre von etwa 20.000 weitaus überstieg. Mehrere Ligakonkurrenten, die über größere Stadien verfügten, erzielten jedoch einen höheren Zuschauerschnitt. 1964 qualifizierte sich der TSV 1860 durch den Gewinn des DFB-Pokals für den Europapokal der Pokalsieger 1964/65, kam bis in das Finale und hatte in dem Wettbewerb zuhause meist mehr als 30.000 Zuschauer. Im selben Jahr wurde der FC Bayern Meister der Regionalliga Süd und qualifizierte sich für die Aufstiegsrunde zur Bundesliga. Dabei erwies sich die Kapazität des Grünwalder Stadions erneut als zu gering. In der Folgesaison gewannen der TSV 1860 die Meisterschaft und der FC Bayern den nationalen Pokalwettbewerb. Zwar war die durchschnittliche Zuschauerzahl weitaus niedriger als die maximale Kapaz: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"1.

Im Einklang mit diesem wird der Senat als „Oberhaus“ (), das House of Commons als „Unterhaus“ () bezeichnet. Diese Bezeichnung steht zwar im Einklang mit der protokollarischen Rangordnung, macht jedoch keine Aussage über die politische Bedeutung. De facto ist das Unterhaus wesentlich einflussreicher. Obwohl formal die Zustimmung beider Kammern notwendig ist, um ein Gesetz zu beschließen, weist der Senat nur in Ausnahmefällen einen Gesetzesentwurf zurück. Der Senat hat keine Möglichkeit, den Premierminister und die übrigen Minister zu wählen oder abzusetzen. Steuergesetze müssen verfassungsgemäß immer ihren Weg im Unterhaus beginnen.', 'Im Senat sitzen 105 Abgeordnete, die der Generalgouverneur auf Empfehlung des kanadischen Premierministers ernennt. Die Sitze sind nach Regionen aufgeteilt. Da die Zahl der Senatoren je Region seit 1867 gleich geblieben ist, ergeben sich mittlerweile große Disproportionalitäten in der Repräsentation im Verhältnis zur Einwohnerzahl. Die Senatoren haben keine feste Amtszeit, sondern können ihr Amt bis zum 75. Lebensjahr wahrnehmen.', 'Das kanadische Parlament geht auf das Verfassungsgesetz von 1867 zurück. Reformvorschläge für den Senat sind fast so alt wie der Senat selbst. Größere Reformen scheiterten bisher aber immer an den Problemen einer dafür notwendigen Verfassungsänderung. Sitz des Parlaments und damit auch des Senats ist die kanadische Hauptstadt Ottawa.', 'Stellung im politischen System.', 'Legislative Aufgaben.', 'Theoretisch verfügen die beiden Parlamentskammern über nahezu identische legislative Rechte: Die Zustimmung beider Kammern ist notwendig, damit ein Gesetz in Kraft treten kann. Ausnahmen bilden Steuergesetze und Verfassungszusätze. Der britischen Tradition folgend, obliegt das Initiativrecht für Steuergesetze dem Unterhaus. Während diese im Vereinigten Königreich rein aus dem Gewohnheitsrecht folgt, orientierten sich die kanadischen Verfassungsväter in diesem Punkt an den USA: Artikel 53 des Verfassungsgesetzes von 1867 schreibt das Privileg des Unterhauses explizit fest. Ob der Senat überhaupt das Recht hat, die Steuergesetzgebung zu beeinflussen, lässt sich dem Verfassungstext nicht explizit entnehmen. Der Senat selbst steht auf dem Standpunkt, dass er durchaus Eingriffsrechte besitzt, solange diese Eingriffe die durch ein Gesetz verursachte Abgabenlast nicht steigern. Das Unterhaus hat die Senatsinterpretation nie herausgefordert.', 'Nach Artikel 47 Absatz 1 des Verfassungsgesetzes von 1982 kann das Unterhaus bei Verfassungsänderungen den Senat überstimmen. Allerdings muss es vor einer erneuten Abstimmung 180 Tage nach der gescheiterten Abstimmung verstreichen lassen. In allen anderen Rechtsgebieten hat der Senat zwar theoretisch die Macht, Gesetze zu stoppen, übt dieses gegenüber dem demokratisch direkt legitimierten Unterhaus aber nur selten aus. Obwohl ein Gesetzentwurf in beiden Kammern des Parlaments eingebracht werden kann, stammen die meisten Gesetzentwürfe aus dem Unterhaus. Da der Zeitplan des Senats aber flexibler ist und ausführlichere Debatten erlaubt, kann es vorkommen, dass die Regierung ein besonders komplexes Gesetz zuerst in den Senat schickt.', 'Oft beschäftigt sich der Senat mehr mit den Details als mit den Grundlinien eines Gesetzentwurfs und stellt zahlreiche kleinere Änderungsvorschläge, die dann auch normalerweise vom Unterhaus akzeptiert werden. Viele Gesetzentwürfe erreichen den Senat allerdings zum Ende der Sitzungsperiode, so dass der Senat faktisch keine Zeit mehr hat, sie inhaltlich zu prüfen. Zwar beschwerten sich die Senatoren regelmäßig darüber, übergangen zu werden, nickten die Gesetzentwürfe aber letztlich doch seit Jahrzehnten ab.', 'Bis in die 1980er Jahre hinein waren die Senatoren der Auffassung, die Senator Keith Davey (Liberal-Ontario) 1986 äußerte: „Obwohl wir nicht gewählt sind, können wir jede und alle Gesetzesinitiativen des gewählten Unterhauses blockieren. Nicht dass wir, angesichts unseres ungewählten Status, unser mächtiges Veto je benutzen würden. Würden wir es tun, würde es uns sofort genommen; und so ist es wie es sein sollte.“', 'Seit 1985 hat sich der Senat aktiver in die Gesetzgebung eingeschaltet. Hatte der Senat zwischen 1961 und 1985 nicht einmal von seinem Vetorecht Gebrauch gemacht, so begann er seitdem dieses öfters zu benutzen. Er widersetzte sich dem Freihandelsabkommen mit den USA ebenso wie der Goods and Services Tax (GST; frz., \\"TPS\\"), der ersten bundesweiten Umsatzsteuer in Kanada. In den 1990er Jahren lehnte der Senat vier Gesetzentwürfe ab: C-43, der das Recht auf Abtreibung einschränken sollte, C-93, der Bundesbehörden zusammenlegen sollte, C-28, Privatisierung des Lester B. Pearson Airports in Toronto, und C-220, der sich mit Profiten aus Autorenrechten über tatsächlich begangene Verbrechen beschäftigt.', 'Eine Aufgabe, die normalerweise dem Gerichtssystem obliegt, nahm der Senat bis zum Scheidungsgesetz von 1968 wahr. Scheidungen waren in Kanada bis 1930 in allen Provinzen – danach nur noch in Québec und Neufundland – nicht vor Gericht, sondern nur durch einen Parlamentserlass möglich. Der Senat gründete 1889 einen eigenen Ausschuss für Scheidungen. Zwischen 1945 und 1968 löste er beispielsweise im Schnitt 340 Ehen im Jahr.', 'Regierungskontrolle.', 'Die Kontrollmöglichkeiten des Senats über die Regierung sind stark eingeschränkt. Vor allem hat er nicht die Macht, die Amtszeit eines Premierministers oder Ministers vorzeitig zu beenden. Obwohl Kabinettsmitglieder theoretisch aus beiden Kammern kommen können, setzen sich die meisten modernen kanadischen Kabinette fast ausschließlich aus Mitgliedern des Unterhauses zusammen. Im Normalfall sitzt nur ein Minister im Senat: Der Regierungsführer im Senat () – ein Minister, der speziell damit beauftragt ist, die Zusammenarbeit mit dem Senat sicherzustellen.', 'In seltenen Fällen ernennt die Regierung auch Minister aus dem Senat. Jüngstes Beispiel ist Michael Fortier, der als Senator für Montreal gleichzeitig Minister für öffentliche Bauten und Dienste war. Premierminister Stephen Harper ernannte ihn am 6. Februar 2006, da seine Minderheitsregierung keine gewählten Vertreter aus dieser Region hatte. Fortier trat vor der Wahl 2008 zurück, um für das Unterhaus zu kandidieren, letztlich aber erfolglos.', 'Mitglieder des Senats.', 'Regionale Zusammensetzung.', 'Nach der kanadischen Verfassung kann jede Provinz oder jedes Territorium eine bestimmte Anzahl an Senatoren stellen. Die Verfassung teilt Kanada dazu in vier Regionen, die je 24 Senatoren stellen können: die maritimen Provinzen, (je zehn für Nova Scotia und New Brunswick, vier für Prince Edward Island), Westkanada (je sechs für Manitoba, British Columbia, Saskatchewan und Alberta), Ontario und Québec. Québec ist dabei die einzige Provinz, in der die Senatoren je spezifischen Distrikten innerhalb der Provinz zugewiesen werden – ursprünglich wurde dies so eingerichtet, um eine proportionale Repräsentation von englisch- und französischsprachigen Senatoren zu gewährleisten. Neufundland und Labrador stellt sechs Senatoren und zählt zu keiner der Regionen. Die drei Territorien Nordwest-Territorien, Yukon und Nunavut entsenden je einen Senator.', 'Als ein Ergebnis dieses Arrangements sind die drei Provinzen mit dem größten Bevölkerungswachstum – Ontario, British Columbia und Alberta – im Senat mittlerweile gravierend unterrepräsentiert, während die maritimen Provinzen ebenso gravierend überrepräsentiert sind. So stellt beispielsweise British Columbia mit vier Millionen Einwohnern sechs Senatoren, während Nova Scotia mit weniger als einer Million Einwohner zehn Senatorenposten besetzen kann. Die einzige Provinz, bei der Bevölkerungsanteil und Anteil der Senatoren in etwa gleich hoch ist, ist Québec.', 'Seit 1989 wählen die Einwohner Albertas „Senatoren auf Abruf“ (), um ihrer Forderung nach direkt gewählten Senatoren Nachdruck zu verleihen. Diese Wahlen sind jedoch nicht bindend, und bisher sandte der Generalgouverneur erst zwei von ihnen tatsächlich in den Senat. Brian Mulroney schlug 1990 den gewählten Stan Waters vor. Waters starb aber bereits 1991, ein Jahr nach seiner Mandatsübernahme. Der zweite war Bert Brown, der 1998 und 2004 gewählt und schließlich 2007 auf Empfehlung von Stephen Harper ernannt wurde.', 'Artikel 26 des Verfassungsgesetzes von 1867 erlaubt dem kanadischen Monarchen, vier oder acht zusätzliche Senatoren zu ernennen. Dabei schlägt der Premierminister je einen oder zwei Senatoren aus jeder Region vor. Bisher nahm der Premierminister erst einmal das Recht erfolgreich in Anspruch: 1990 benötigte Brian Mulroney eine konservative Mehrheit im Senat, um das Gesetz über die bundesweite Umsatzsteuer zu verabschieden. Er wollte diese durch die Ernennung von acht zusätzlichen Senatoren erlangen. Königin Elisabeth II. folgte seinem Vorschlag, womit die Verantwortung für die Ernennung beim Premierminister lag, der direkt dem Unterhaus rechenschaftspflichtig ist. 1874 lehnte Königin Victoria auf Rat der britischen Regierung den Vorschlag zusätzlicher Senatoren durch Alexander Mackenzie ab.', 'Senatoren.', 'Der Generalgouverneur ernennt in Vertretung des Königs die Senatoren. De facto hält er sich dabei an die „Empfehlungen“, die der Premierminister ausspricht. In der Praxis zeigt sich, dass ein Großteil der Senatoren ehemalige Minister, ehemalige Provinzpremiers oder andere ehemals einflussreiche Politiker sind. Das Verfassungsgesetz von 1867 schreibt die Bedingungen fest, die ein Senator erfüllen muss. Er schließt Nicht-Bürger von Kanada ebenso aus wie Personen, die jünger als 30 Jahre alt sind. Senatoren müssen ihren Wohnsitz in der Provinz haben, für die sie ernannt werden.', 'Aufgrund der Ernennungsprozedur kommen neue Senatoren fast ausschließlich aus der Partei des amtierenden Premierministers oder stehen ihr zumindest nahe. Einen leichten Bruch mit dieser Tradition versuchte der liberale Premierminister Paul Martin (2003–2006). Er war der Auffassung, dass riesige liberale Mehrheiten im Senat dessen verfassungsgemäße Aufgabe erheblich kompromittierten und so ein gewichtiges Demokratiedefizit darstellten, Martin ernannte fünf von 14 Senatoren seiner Amtszeit aus Reihen der Opposition. Vorher hatten nur zwei Premierminister überhaupt oppositionelle Senatoren in größerer Anzahl ernannt, wenn auch zu einem weit geringeren Anteil als Martin: Pierre Trudeau (1968–1979; 1980–1983) ernannte acht von 81 Senatoren aus den Reihen der Opposition, Kanadas erster Premierminister John Macdonald (1867–1873: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"1.

Olympiade\\" genannt) fanden vom 6. April bis zum 15. April 1896 in Athen statt. Es waren die ersten Olympischen Spiele, nachdem die Olympischen Spiele der Antike im Jahre 393 vom römischen Kaiser Theodosius I. wegen der Verehrung heidnischer Götter verboten worden waren.', 'Obwohl die Spiele auch für damalige Verhältnisse kaum sportliche Leistungen der Spitzenklasse erbrachten, wurden sie allgemein als großer Erfolg angesehen und sorgten maßgeblich dafür, dass die Olympischen Spiele sich dauerhaft etablieren konnten. Es nahmen 241 Athleten teil, Frauen waren nicht zugelassen, durften aber, anders als bei den antiken Spielen, zuschauen. Auch wenn die Olympischen Spiele 1896 verglichen mit heutigen Austragungen sehr klein waren, hatten sie doch eine bis dahin ungekannte Größe für eine Sportveranstaltung.', 'Wahl des Austragungsortes.', 'Während des 19. Jahrhunderts hatten in einigen europäischen Ländern kleinere Sportfeste stattgefunden, die nach den Olympischen Spielen der Antike benannt waren, jedoch höchstens eine überregionale Ausstrahlung hatten. Der französische Pädagoge und Historiker Pierre de Coubertin wollte die große Bedeutung der antiken Spiele in die Neuzeit übertragen, wozu jedoch zahlreiche Sportarten und ein internationales Teilnehmerfeld unerlässlich waren. Am 23. Juni 1894 präsentierte er seine Ideen anlässlich eines Kongresses, der in der Sorbonne von Paris stattfand. An dem Kongress nahmen Delegierte von Sportverbänden aus elf Ländern teil.', 'Nach dem Beschluss, die Olympischen Spiele wieder aufleben zu lassen, musste der erste Austragungsort bestimmt werden. De Coubertins Wunschvorstellung war es eigentlich, die ersten Spiele der Neuzeit im Jahr 1900 anlässlich der Weltausstellung in Paris auszutragen. Doch die übrigen Delegierten befürchteten, wegen der langen Wartezeit von sechs Jahren könnte das Interesse wieder abflauen. Sie beschlossen deshalb, die ersten Olympischen Spiele bereits 1896 zu veranstalten. Einige Delegierte wünschten London als Austragungsort. Doch nach einem Gespräch mit dem griechischen Delegierten Demetrius Vikelas schlug de Coubertin Athen vor, um Griechenland als Ursprung der Olympischen Spiele zu ehren. Die Delegierten stimmten diesem Vorschlag einstimmig zu und wählten Vikelas zum ersten Präsidenten des neu gegründeten Internationalen Olympischen Komitees (IOC).', 'Organisation.', 'Die Nachricht, dass die Olympischen Spiele nach Griechenland zurückkehren sollten, wurde in der griechischen Öffentlichkeit und in den Medien mit Wohlwollen aufgenommen. Das Land hatte jedoch mit finanziellen Problemen zu kämpfen, war wegen ständiger Regierungswechsel politisch instabil und sah sich nicht in der Lage, die nötigen Mittel bereitzustellen. Ende 1894 veröffentlichte das Organisationskomitee einen Bericht, der aufzeigte, dass die Kosten dreimal so hoch ausfallen würden wie ursprünglich von Pierre de Coubertin vorausgesehen. Der Bericht kam zum Schluss, dass die Spiele nicht durchgeführt werden könnten und die Mitglieder des Organisationskomitees boten ihren Rücktritt an.', 'Kronprinz Konstantin, der die Idee der Olympischen Spiele stets unterstützt hatte, beschloss die Bildung eines neuen Organisationskomitees mit ihm selbst als Vorsitzenden. Nachdem er begonnen hatte, öffentlich für die Spiele zu werben, konnten große Spenden akquiriert werden, einerseits aus Griechenland selbst, andererseits von den bedeutenden griechischen Gemeinschaften in London, Marseille und Istanbul. Auf diese Weise kamen 330.000 Drachmen zusammen. Eine Serie von Sonderbriefmarken brachte weitere 400.000 Drachmen ein, der Verkauf von Eintrittskarten 200.000 Drachmen.', 'Auch die königliche Familie Griechenlands förderte dieses Ereignis stark. Nikolaus von Griechenland, ein Sohn des griechischen Königs Georg I., war der Präsident der Schießwettbewerbe. Auch weitere Angehörige des Königshauses, zum Beispiel Georg von Griechenland, beteiligten sich an den Vorbereitungen. Auf Wunsch des Kronprinzen übernahm der reiche Geschäftsmann Georgios Averoff sämtliche Kosten für den Neubau des Panathinaiko-Stadions. Insgesamt spendete er etwa 920.000 Drachmen. Um seine Großzügigkeit zu ehren, wurde eine Statue von Averoff geschaffen und einen Tag vor Beginn der Spiele enthüllt. Diese steht noch heute vor dem Stadion.', 'Veranstaltungsort.', 'Das Panathinaiko-Stadion ist ein Wiederaufbau des antiken Athener Stadions aus dem Jahr 330 v. Chr., in dem die antiken „Panathenäischen Spiele“ ausgetragen wurden. Neben den Leichtathletikwettkämpfen wurden auch die Wettbewerbe im Gewichtheben, Ringen und Turnen im Panathinaiko-Stadion durchgeführt. Die Hufeisenform hatte innen eine Länge von 236 Metern, die Laufbahn war während der Spiele 333,33 Meter lang. Der Architekt Anastasios Metaxas verwendete bei der Rekonstruktion nach Plänen von Ernst Ziller alle erhaltenen Elemente. Da die Zeit knapp wurde, verzichtete man auf die Marmorverkleidung der ganzen Tribüne, und baute eine provisorische aus Holz. Diese war so eingebettet, dass sie aus der Ferne nicht als solche zu erkennen war. Zusätzlich wurde sie weiß gestrichen. Das Stadion hatte etwa 69.000 Plätze, davon 50.000 Sitzplätze. Für die ersten Olympischen Spiele wird eine Gesamtzuschauerzahl von etwa 312.000 geschätzt. Es soll 30 bis 40 akkreditierte Journalisten gegeben haben, darunter acht Fotografen.', 'Nach zeitgenössischen Berichten war Athen während der Dauer der Spiele jede Nacht beleuchtet. Es fanden Fackelumzüge statt, Kapellen spielten die Nationalhymnen der einzelnen Länder, Studenten besuchten die verschiedenen Mannschaftsquartiere und brachten den Mannschaften Ovationen. Allerdings gab es auch organisatorische Probleme: Das gesamte Veranstaltungsprogramm und die Einladungen zu Abendveranstaltungen waren in Griechisch verfasst. Darüber hinaus galt in Griechenland noch der Julianische Kalender, so dass die angereisten Athleten oft Mühe hatten, das richtige Wettkampfdatum zu ermitteln.', 'Teilnehmer.', 'Die Spiele fanden unter strikten Amateurregeln statt – eine Bestimmung, die schon damals für einige Kontroversen sorgte, da die genaue Definition dessen, was ein Amateur ist, von Land zu Land verschieden war. Erst die verbindliche Anwendung der Regeln der internationalen Dachverbände (soweit es sie schon gab) sowie der persönliche Einsatz des Kronprinzen und obersten Schiedsrichters der Spiele verhinderten mehrmals einen Eklat. Ausnahmen wurden dem Fechten gewährt, für professionelle Fechtmeister im Offiziersrang wurde ein zusätzlicher Wettbewerb veranstaltet; Schützen erhielten in allen europäischen Staaten erhebliche Sach- bzw. Geldpreise, wurden aber als Amateure behandelt. Athleten aus Australien galten nur dann als Amateure, wenn sie z. B. als Studenten die Überfahrt selbst bezahlt hatten, da sie sonst während der monatelangen Überfahrt von ihrem Verein/Verband gelebt hätten, was ebenfalls den Amateurregeln widersprach.', 'Das größte Team stellten die Griechen, gefolgt von den Deutschen, den Amerikanern und den Franzosen. Die Teilnehmer waren nicht in Nationalteams organisiert und es fanden nur in Ausnahmefällen Qualifikationswettkämpfe statt. Für Großbritannien beispielsweise traten zwei Angestellte der Botschaft in Athen an. An den ersten Olympischen Spielen entzündeten sich auch nationalistische Konflikte. So nahmen die Turner in Frankreich, Belgien und dem Deutschen Reich eine kompromisslos oppositionelle Haltung gegen eine gemeinsame Veranstaltung mit den als proletarisch und \\"englisch\\" verschrienen übrigen Sportarten ein. Im Deutschen Reich erschienen kurz vor Meldeschluss Zeitungsartikel, die versuchten, die Olympischen Spiele als französisch-griechische und somit für Deutsche unwürdige Veranstaltung zu denunzieren – durchaus mit einigem Erfolg.

Die ersten Bewohner gehörten der Glockenbecherkultur an, sie siedelten auf dem Oberfeld nahe der Hangkante, betrieben Ackerbau und begruben ihre Toten in Hockergräbern. Im heutigen Untersendling wurden außerdem Siedlungsreste aus der Urnenfelderkultur der späten Bronzezeit gefunden. In anderen Gegenden Südbayerns gab es bereits seit der Jungsteinzeit sesshafte Bauern, aber die Bodenbeschaffenheit auf der Münchner Schotterebene war für den Ackerbau wenig geeignet.', 'Ab dem 16. Jahrhundert v. Chr. folgte die Zeit der Hügelgräberkultur, die um das 12. Jahrhundert v. Chr. von der Urnenfelderkultur abgelöst wurde. Das Klima war zu jener Zeit relativ warm.

Ob Sendling direkt betroffen war, ist nicht bekannt. Ab etwa 980 sind mehrere Land-Übereignungen unter den adeligen Grundherrn schriftlich überliefert, die die Sendlinger Bauerngüter und ihre dort arbeitenden Leibeigenen ausbeuteten. Der Bischof von Freising und das Kloster Schäftlarn vermehrten ihren Besitz am Ort bis ins 11. Jahrhundert.

Die früheren Erwähnungen als \\"in loco\\" könnten auch einen Gutsbetrieb gemeint haben.', '1158 gründete Heinrich der Löwe München. Das Dorfleben veränderte sich vermutlich durch die Stadtgründung und ihre schnelle Entwicklung. Die Stadt bot einen größeren Markt, die Peterskirche wurde zuständige Pfarrkirche für Sendling. Um dieselbe Zeit wurde der \\"nobilis vir\\" (Edelmann, Adeliger) namens \\"Norpert Sentlinger\\" erwähnt, möglicherweise gab es also im 12. Jahrhundert einen Herrenhof in Sendling, nach dem sich die Familie benannte. Die Familie war siegel- und turnierfähig, ihr Wappen zeigte auf Schwarz ein rotbewehrtes goldenes Einhorn. 1239 ist erstmals ein Sentlinger in der Verwaltung Münchens nachweisbar, Mitglieder der Familie saßen lange im \\"Inneren Rat\\" der Stadt, dem höchsten Bürgergremium.

Auch Sendling wurde mehrmals von eigenen wie fremden Truppen geplündert, von Not, Armut und Krankheiten wie der Pest heimgesucht. Die Einwohnerzahl dürfte in dieser Zeit abgenommen haben, wer konnte flüchtete in den Schutz der Stadtmauern. 1632 waren schwedische Truppen in der Münchner Gegend. Die Stadt ergab sich König Gustav Adolf und zahlte einen hohen Geldbetrag, dafür wurde sie nicht geplündert und zerstört. Umso mehr erbeuteten die Soldaten auf dem umliegenden Land, das dort geraubte Gut ließ sich in der Stadt zu Geld machen. Westenrieder schrieb rund 150 Jahre später: \\"„Aus ihrem Lager vor dem Neuhauser Tor brachten die Schweden viel zum Verkauf in die Stadt: Tische, Bretter, Bänke, eine Menge Rosse, Rinder, Schweine, Leinwand, zinnerne Schüsseln und Kandeln, ganze Bauernwagen, Schlösser, Türbänder, Mäntel, Weiberröcke, Betten und mehr dergleichen.“\\" 1638 verkaufte der Abt von Benediktbeuern vom Krieg in Mitleidenschaft gezogene Sendlinger Güter und vermerkte aus diesem Anlass in seinem Tagebuch \\"„dass etliche besagte, unserem Gotteshaus angehörige Höf und Güter verschiedene Jahre her, durch vorübergegangenes höchst leidiges Kriegswesen, sowohl von Freunds- als auch von Feindsvolk überverderbt und aufs äußerste ruiniert und teilweise gar abgebrannt worden.“\\" Ab der Mitte des 17.

Zuvor waren lediglich der Erst- und Zweitplatzierte mit einer Silber- bzw. einer Bronzemedaille ausgezeichnet worden.', 'Wahl des Austragungsortes.', 'Pierre de Coubertin, der Präsident des Internationalen Olympischen Komitees (IOC), hatte bereits bei der Gründungsversammlung im Jahr 1894 den Wunsch geäußert, die dritten Olympischen Spiele der Neuzeit sollten in den Vereinigten Staaten stattfinden. Mehrere amerikanische Städte bewarben sich um die Ausrichtung, neben St. Louis auch Buffalo und Chicago. Weitaus am meisten Vorarbeit leistete das Chicagoer Komitee. Anlässlich der vierten Session des IOC am 21. und 22. Mai 1901 in Paris legte es ein Rahmenprogramm und einen konkreten Finanzplan vor. Stattfinden sollten die Spiele vom 10. bis 25. September 1904.', 'Die elf anwesenden IOC-Mitglieder (von insgesamt 28) bestimmten Chicago zum Austragungsort. Daraufhin bildeten sich mehrere Fachkommissionen, die die Vorbereitungen in die Wege leiteten. US-Präsident Theodore Roosevelt übernahm im September 1901 das Patronat der dritten Olympischen Spiele – wenige Tage nach der Ermordung seines Vorgängers William McKinley, der ebenfalls eine entsprechende Zusage gemacht hatte.', 'Fünf Jahre zuvor hatte David Francis, der ehemalige Gouverneur von Missouri und 1896/97 Innenminister in der Regierung von Grover Cleveland, der Vereinigung der Geschäftsleute von St. Louis vorgeschlagen, 1903 das 100. Jubiläum des Louisiana Purchase mit einer großen internationalen Ausstellung zu feiern. Die Bauarbeiten auf dem Ausstellungsgelände im Forest Park – damals noch ein dicht bewaldetes Gebiet – begannen im Sommer 1901. Dabei ergaben sich erhebliche Verzögerungen und Finanzierungsschwierigkeiten, weshalb die Ausstellung im Juli 1902 um ein Jahr auf 1904 verschoben werden musste.', 'James E. Sullivan (zuständig für das Sportprogramm der Weltausstellung) und David Francis (mittlerweile Präsident des Organisationskomitees) sahen in der Verschiebung eine Chance, die Olympischen Spiele doch noch nach St. Louis zu holen. Theodore Roosevelt, der über gute Kontakte zu Pierre de Coubertin verfügte, sprach sich nun ebenfalls für St. Louis aus, da in Chicago die Vorbereitungen ins Stocken geraten waren. Nachdem das dortige Komitee um eine Verschiebung auf das Jahr 1905 ersucht hatte, ließ Coubertin im Dezember 1902 eine zweite Abstimmung über den Austragungsort durchführen. 14 von 21 IOC-Mitgliedern, die per Brief geantwortet hatten, befürworteten die Vergabe der Spiele nach St. Louis, fünf enthielten sich der Stimme.', 'Organisation.', 'Verantwortlich für die Sportveranstaltungen während der Weltausstellung war die Abteilung P („Physical Culture“ – Körperkultur) des Organisationskomitees der Louisiana Purchase Exposition, die von James E. Sullivan, dem Schatzmeister der Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), geleitet wurde. Sullivan war zugleich Direktor der Olympischen Spiele und des \\"Olympic Games Committee\\" (OGC). Pierre de Coubertin war von Sullivan ausgebootet worden, weshalb Coubertin nicht einmal nach St. Louis zu \\"seinen\\" Spielen fuhr. und stattdessen eine Woche vor Beginn der Spiele in London zur 6. Session des IOC einlud. Hier wurden u. a. die Spiele von 1908 nach London vergeben. Ehrenpräsident des OGC war Theodore Roosevelt, während Alfred G. Shapleigh, Vizepräsident der Washington University, die Rolle des Schirmherren innehatte. Der Vorstand setzte sich aus mehreren Mitgliedern der AAU und des amerikanischen Fechtverbandes zusammen. Mitglieder des Internationalen Olympischen Komitees waren nicht vertreten.', 'Die Durchführung der Wettbewerbe lag in der Verantwortung der nationalen Sportverbände sowie Vertretern diverser Universitäten und Sportvereine. Internationale Sportverbände waren zu Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts noch eine Seltenheit und wurden zudem nicht berücksichtigt. Die Jurys setzten sich ausschließlich aus Amerikanern zusammen, die meist keine Kenntnis von etwaigen abweichenden europäischen Regeln hatten. Dies führte im Verlauf der Olympischen Spiele bei der Regelauslegung immer wieder zu Missverständnissen, Fehlbeurteilungen und Bevorzugung der eigenen Landsleute.', 'Wettkampfstätten.', 'Zentraler Austragungsort der olympischen Wettbewerbe war das Stadion Francis Field, rund elf Kilometer westlich des Stadtzentrums auf dem Campus der Washington University gelegen. Benannt ist es nach David Francis, dem Direktor der Weltausstellung. Hier wurden folgende Sportarten ausgetragen: Basketball, Bogenschießen, Fußball, Gewichtheben, Lacrosse, Leichtathletik, Radsport, Ringen, Roque, Tauziehen und Turnen.', '1899 hatte die Washington University das auf den Bau von Universitätsgebäuden spezialisierte Architekturbüro \\"Cope &amp; Stewardson\\" mit dem Entwurf eines Stadions für 25.000 Zuschauer beauftragt. 1902 waren die Bauarbeiten abgeschlossen. Das Stadion, das heute den Sportmannschaften der Universität dient, befand sich am äußersten nordwestlichen Rand des über 500 Hektar großen Ausstellungsgeländes. Die Anlage besaß bis zum Umbau Mitte der 1980er Jahre eine für heutige Verhältnisse ungewöhnliche Form: Die Aschenbahn war eine Drittelmeile (536,44 m) lang, hatte drei kurze und eine lange Gerade von rund 220 m Länge. Diese Form war wenig zuschauerfreundlich, da die lange Gerade, auf der die meisten Entscheidungen fielen, relativ weit von der Tribüne entfernt lag.', 'Unmittelbar neben dem Stadion steht das \\"Francis Gymnasium\\". Die 1903 im Tudorstil erbaute Sporthalle, damals noch als \\"Physical Education Building\\" bezeichnet, war Austragungsort der Wettbewerbe im Boxen und Fechten sowie einzelner Basketballspiele. Die Tennisturniere fanden auf den drei Francis Field Dirt Courts neben dem Stadion statt. Die Ruderwettbewerbe wurden auf dem Creve Coeur Lake ausgetragen, einem See rund 18 km nordwestlich des Stadions in der Nähe des Missouri Rivers. Gastgeber der Golfturniere war der \\"Glen Echo Country Club\\", etwa 6 km nördlich des Stadions im Vorort Normandy; der älteste noch heute existierende 18-Loch-Golfplatz westlich des Mississippi Rivers war erst drei Jahre zuvor eröffnet worden.', 'Nur die Wassersportwettbewerbe (Schwimmen, Wasserball, Wasserspringen) fanden inmitten des eigentlichen Weltausstellungsgeländes statt, im Life Saving Exhibition Lake. Dabei handelte es sich um einen künstlich angelegten See, in dem üblicherweise die United States Coast Guard, die amerikanische Küstenwache, Vorführungen im Rettungsschwimmen zeigte. Der See wurde von einem Bach durchflossen und war von Düngerrückständen und dem Viehmist der unmittelbar benachbarten Landwirtschaftsausstellung stark verunreinigt, weshalb zahlreiche Wassersportler während und nach den Wettkämpfen erkrankten.', 'Teilnehmer.', 'Erstmals vertreten waren Sportler aus dem Gebiet des späteren Südafrika. Im Tauziehen bildeten sechs eingewanderte Buren, die wahrscheinlich auf der Weltausstellung als Arbeiter beschäftigt waren, eine Mannschaft. Am Marathonlauf nahmen Len Taunyane und Jan Mashiani von den Tswana teil, letzterer fälschlich den Zulu zugerechnet. Beide waren als Meldeläufer von General Cronjé Veteranen des Burenkriegs und nahmen mit diesem an einem Reenactment dieses Krieges teil – eine der Hauptattraktionen der Weltausstellung. Nach der erfolgreichen Teilnahme an einem Meilenlauf wurden Taunyane und Mashiani zur Teilnahme an den Olympischen Sommerspielen eingeladen. Die Tatsache, dass zwei Schwarze zu den ersten südafrikanischen Olympioniken gehörten, wurde während der Zeit der Apartheid weitgehend verschwiegen.', 'Österreich und Ungarn waren zwar Bestandteile des Staates Österreich-Ungarn, doch wurden die Resultate von Sportlern dieser Länder in den Statistiken getrennt geführt. Bei den 15 anwesenden Griechen handelte es sich überwiegend um Personen, die vor kurzem in die USA eingewandert waren und bei späteren Olympischen Spielen nicht mehr in Erscheinung traten.', 'Allgemein ist anzumerken, dass Sportler aus Übersee nur eine kleine Minderheit bildeten. Hauptgrund waren die hohen Reisekosten und die lange Reisezeit, die bis zu drei Wochen betrug. Auch verhinderte das über mehrere Monate verteilte Veranstaltungsprogramm die geschlossene Anreise ausländischer Delegationen. Nur im Deutschen Reich bildete sich, auf Initiative von Willibald Gebhardt, ein Unterstützungskomitee. Daraus entstand im selben Jahr der Deutsche Reichsausschuss für Olympische Spiele.', 'Medaillen und Auszeichnungen.', '1896 in Athen und 1900 in Paris waren jeweils nur die beiden besten Sportler ausgezeichnet worden, mit einer Silber- bzw. einer Bronzemedaille.

Seine Reden, die ihn bekannt gemacht hatten, sind verloren gegangen.', 'Wenngleich er in seinen philosophischen Schriften Verzicht und Zurückhaltung empfahl, gehörte Seneca zu den reichsten und mächtigsten Männern seiner Zeit. Vom Jahr 49 an war er der maßgebliche Erzieher bzw. Berater des späteren Kaisers Nero. Wohl um diesen auf seine künftigen Aufgaben vorzubereiten, verfasste er eine Denkschrift darüber, warum es weise sei, als Herrscher Milde walten zu lassen \\"(De clementia)\\". Im Jahre 55 bekleidete Seneca ein Suffektkonsulat. Sein Agieren als Politiker stand teils im schroffen Widerspruch zu den von ihm in seinen philosophischen Schriften vertretenen ethischen Grundsätzen, was ihm bereits bei Zeitgenossen Kritik eintrug, da er als raffgieriger Opportunist galt.', 'Senecas Bemühen, Nero in seinem Sinne zu beeinflussen, war kein dauerhafter Erfolg beschieden. Zuletzt beschuldigte ihn der Kaiser der Beteiligung an der Pisonischen Verschwörung und befahl ihm die Selbsttötung. Diesem Befehl kam Seneca notgedrungen nach.', 'Leben und Werk.', 'Ausdrückliche Bezüge Senecas auf die eigene Biographie sind in seinen Werken äußerst selten, obwohl er von der Bedeutung seiner schriftlichen Hinterlassenschaft für die Nachwelt überzeugt war.', 'Senecas autobiographisches Schweigen hat erhebliche Probleme vor allem bezüglich der Datierung seiner Werke zur Folge, sodass insbesondere für die Abfolge seiner Tragödiendichtung kaum Anhaltspunkte gegeben sind. Dennoch legen die neueren einschlägigen Seneca-Biographien eine mehr oder minder enge Verbindung seiner Schriften mit seiner jeweiligen Lebenssituation nahe. Sein Philosophieren bestand nicht in der Schaffung eines neuen gedanklichen Systems, sondern wesentlich in der Anwendung der stoischen Lehre „nach Maßgabe der jeweiligen besonderen Lebenslage und Lebensnotwendigkeit“. In seinen Werken, auch in den Spätschriften, betonte er seine Verwurzelung in der stoischen Philosophie. Dabei lehnte er dogmatische Festlegungen ab.', 'Senecas wechselvoller Lebenslauf hat ihm mehrfach abverlangt, sich auf Schicksalswenden einzustellen; und er konnte sie in stoischer Manier gutheißen:', 'Die Vielfalt der Erfahrungen im politischen Leben und die unterschiedlichen Rollen, die er dabei übernahm, sind in Senecas philosophischen Schriften verarbeitet. Aus ihnen resultieren – und dies war Seneca durchaus bewusst – je nach besonderer persönlicher und politischer Lage unterschiedliche Optionen sittlich verantwortbaren Handelns.', 'Die Annahme, dass Senecas Leben und Werk eine Einheit bildeten, dass sich also Seneca als Politiker und Geschäftsmann nach seinen eigenen philosophischen Lehren richtete, wird seit längerem in der Forschung angezweifelt. So urteilte u. a. der Altphilologe Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff 1931 angesichts der tiefen Verstrickung des Philosophen in das Regime Neros: „Solange er am höfischen und politischen Leben teilnahm, hatte er auch die Moral, nicht nur die stoische, an den Nagel gehängt oder doch nur mit den Lippen bekannt, und auf dem Totenbett posiert er, wie er es in seinen Schriften immer getan hat.“', 'Tacitus bezeugt, dass Seneca bereits von seinen Zeitgenossen wegen des Widerspruchs zwischen seinen Lehren und seinem Handeln attackiert wurde. So warf ihm der Senator Publius Suillius Rufus öffentlich vor, seine Machtposition am Hof auszunutzen, um verbrecherisch zu Reichtum zu gelangen:', 'Andere Forscher vertreten allerdings eine Gegenposition und verteidigen die Einheit von Leben und Lehre Senecas. Die Altertumswissenschaftlerin Hildegard Cancik-Lindemaier vertrat 1967 die These, Seneca habe gerade als Philosoph weniger durch seine Dialoge und Traktate wirken wollen als durch die in ihnen dargestellten positiven und negativen Seiten der eigenen Person: „Das Selbstzeugnis als Exemplum gehört in die Mitte des senecanischen Philosophierens; in ihm wird die Einheit von Leben und Lehre unmittelbar bezeugt.“ Der Latinist Niklas Holzberg erklärte 2016 die Existenz der bösartigen \\"Apocolocyntosis\\", die schlecht mit der stoischen Ethik Senecas vereinbar sei, damit, dass es sich um eine spätere Fälschung handle.', 'Ungewisse Anfänge.', 'Senecas Geburtsjahr ist nicht überliefert und auch nicht sicher bestimmbar. Neuere Rekonstruktionsversuche sprechen für das Jahr 1, doch wird auch weiterhin das Jahr 1. v. Chr. genannt. Im spanischen Corduba geboren, gelangte er noch als Kleinkind in der Obhut seiner Tante nach Rom; anscheinend wollte sein Vater Seneca der Ältere als \\"eques\\" seinen Sohn schon von klein auf im Herzen der Weltmacht heranwachsen sehen und den feinen römischen Zungenschlag annehmen lassen. Mit seiner Frau Helvia hatte er noch zwei weitere Söhne. Senecas älterer Bruder Novatus wurde unter seinem Adoptivnamen Gallio 51/52 n. Chr. Prokonsul in der Provinz Achaia und wies u. a. eine Klage der Juden gegen den Apostel Paulus ab; später übernahm er das Amt eines Konsuls. Seneca widmete ihm drei seiner Schriften, darunter \\"De ira (Über den Zorn)\\" und \\"De vita beata (Vom glücklichen Leben)\\". Sein jüngerer Bruder Mela übernahm die Verwaltung des Familienbesitzes in Corduba.', 'Seneca der Ältere betrieb intensiv rhetorische Studien und verfasste darüber ein Werk, in dem er sich sehr kritisch zur gekünstelten zeitgenössischen Rhetorik äußerte. Auf diesem Felde war der gleichnamige Sohn also frühzeitig orientiert. In Verbindung damit dürfte er einen vorzüglichen rechtskundlichen Unterricht erhalten haben, der ihn auf eine anwaltliche Tätigkeit vorbereitete, für die es unerlässlich war, das rhetorische Instrumentarium zu beherrschen.', 'Die rhetorischen Stilübungen waren ihm allerdings weit weniger wichtig als die philosophischen Grundsätze, die ihm seine Lehrer Sotion und Attalos vermittelten. Sotion, der neben stoischen auch pythagoreische Lehren vertrat, beeinflusste Seneca stark und nachhaltig. Er veranlasste ihn zeitweise dazu, gemäß der pythagoreischen Tradition nur fleischfreie Kost zu sich zu nehmen. Die empfohlene harte Matratze für seine Bettstatt behielt Seneca bis ins Alter bei. Vor der Nachtruhe nahm er, wie er es bei Sotion gelernt hatte, täglich eine Rekapitulation des Tages als Selbstprüfung und Gewissensforschung vor:', 'Gesundheitlich war Seneca von Kindesbeinen an und während seines ganzen Lebens durch Asthma-Anfälle und chronische Bronchitis stark eingeschränkt. Atemnöte und Fieberschübe setzten ihm in jungen Jahren derartig zu, dass er davor stand, sich das Leben zu nehmen. Eine gewisse Stabilisierung trat erst ein, als er im Alter von etwa 30 Jahren das ihm bekömmlichere Klima im ägyptischen Alexandria aufsuchte, wo er bei seiner Tante unterkam, die mit dem römischen Präfekten von Ägypten verheiratet war. Sie setzte sich für ihn ein, als er nach seiner Rückkehr nach Rom, wo er sich als Anwalt bei den Gerichten bereits einen Namen gemacht hatte, erfolgreich um die Quästur als Einstieg in die römische Ämterlaufbahn bewarb.', 'In diese Zeit fielen auch die ersten seiner überlieferten philosophischen Schriften in Briefform. In der \\"Trostschrift an Marcia\\", die Tochter des Historikers Cremutius Cordus, deren Kind verstorben war, betrachtete er die Entwicklung ihrer Trauer und gab Anregungen, ihr über den Verlust des Sohnes hinwegzuhelfen.', 'Noch akzentuierter griff er klassisches stoisches Gedankengut in seinem dreiteiligen Werk \\"De ira\\" auf. Diese Arbeit stammt aus den vierziger Jahren und ist seinem Bruder gewidmet. Das Problem der Affektkontrolle wird hier auf vielfältige Weise lebenspraktisch, historisch-exemplarisch und politisch abgehandelt.', 'Da es sich nach Seneca beim Zorn um eine beherrschbare Regung handelt, hielt er entsprechendes erzieherisches Einwirken für nötig. Dabei kam es ihm besonders auf die genaue Beobachtung der individuellen Entwicklung an, weil z. B. mit dem Mittel des Lobes einerseits das Selbstbewusstsein des Schützlings gestärkt, andererseits aber Überheblichkeit und Jähzorn gefördert werden könnten. Mal müsse eben gebremst, mal angefeuert werden.

Ausschlaggebend für seinen weiteren Lebenslauf wurde das julisch-claudische Herrscherhaus allerdings erst im Jahre 41, als Seneca nach der Beseitigung des despotischen Caligula von dessen Nachfolger Claudius in die Verbannung nach Korsika geschickt wurde.', 'Dies geschah auf Betreiben Messalinas, mit der Claudius in dritter Ehe verheiratet war und die Julia Livilla als potentielle Rivalin ausschalten wollte. Deshalb denunzierte sie diese wegen angeblichen Ehebruchs mit Seneca. Nur der Fürsprache Kaiser Claudius’ im Senat war es zu verdanken, dass Seneca statt zum Tode zur Verbannung nach Korsika verurteilt wurde. Weil dies in Form einer Relegatio (nicht der Deportatio) geschah, blieben ihm Eigentum und staatsbürgerliche Rechte erhalten.', 'Acht Jahre währte die Verbannung auf Korsika insgesamt. Erhalten sind aus dieser Zeit vor allem zwei Trostschriften, in denen Seneca einerseits stoischen Schicksalsgehorsam, andererseits aber auch den dringenden Wunsch nach Beendigung des Exils zum Ausdruck brachte. Er zeigte sich, indem er Trost spendete, zugleich als Trost Suchender in auf die Dauer quälender Abgeschiedenheit.', 'In dem Trostschreiben an seine Mutter Helvia, die von seiner Verbannung hart getroffen worden war, versicherte Seneca, er sei nicht unglücklich auf Korsika und könne es auch gar nicht werden.

Olympiade\\" genannt) fanden vom 27. April bis zum 31. Oktober 1908 in der britischen Hauptstadt London statt. Die Wettkämpfe wurden parallel zur Franco-British Exhibition ausgetragen, einer zur Festigung der Entente cordiale zwischen dem Vereinigten Königreich und Frankreich organisierten Messe. Im Gegensatz zu den Spielen in Paris 1900 und St. Louis 1904, als die sportlichen Wettkämpfe wegen der chaotischen Organisation zu einem unbedeutenden Anhängsel der jeweiligen Weltausstellung gerieten, fanden die Spiele in London eine weitaus größere Beachtung. Dazu trug vor allem die Tatsache bei, dass mehr als zwei Drittel aller Wettkämpfe auf zwei Wochen im Juli und auf eine einzige Wettkampfstätte konzentriert waren.', 'Neben diesen eigentlichen „Sommerspielen“ gab es drei weitere Veranstaltungsphasen. Die „Frühjahrsspiele“ von Ende April bis Mitte Juni umfassten vier Ballsportarten. Von Ende Juli bis Ende August folgten die „nautischen Spiele“ mit Wassersportarten an Außenstandorten. Den Abschluss bildeten in der zweiten Oktoberhälfte die „Winterspiele“ mit Sportarten, die in Großbritannien traditionell hauptsächlich in der kühleren Jahreshälfte betrieben werden (Boxen und verschiedene Ballsportarten). Da eine Halle zur Verfügung stand, in der künstlich Eis erzeugt werden konnte, war es erstmals möglich, Wettkämpfe in einer Wintersportart auszutragen, im Eiskunstlauf.', 'Wahl des Austragungsortes.', 'Die Londoner Spiele waren eigentlich die fünfte Austragung der Olympischen Spiele der Neuzeit und folgten auf die sogenannten Olympischen Zwischenspiele 1906 in Athen. Doch das IOC betrachtete diese auf Drängen seines Präsidenten Pierre de Coubertin nachträglich lediglich als „Zehnjahresjubiläum“ der ersten modernen Spiele von 1896 und sprach ihnen den offiziellen Status ab – obwohl sie mit ihrer straffen Organisation ein Vorbild für die nachfolgenden Veranstaltungen waren und verhinderten, dass die olympische Idee völlig in der Bedeutungslosigkeit versank. Die Spiele in London fielen auf den Beginn der vierten Olympiade, womit sie im Einklang mit dem von Anfang an vorgesehenen Vierjahresrhythmus waren.', 'London war nicht der ursprünglich vorgesehene Veranstaltungsort. Bereits 1901 hatten die deutschen IOC-Vertreter den Antrag gestellt, die Spiele von 1908 in Berlin auszutragen. Im März 1903 beschloss die italienische Turnervereinigung \\"Federazione Gimnastica Italiana\\", sich um die Austragung der Spiele in Rom zu bewerben. Im Januar 1904 übernahm der Stadtrat von Rom die Schirmherrschaft über die Kandidatur und verlieh ihr dadurch einen offiziellen Charakter. Dies entsprach auch den Wünschen von Pierre de Coubertin, der nie einen Hehl daraus machte, dass er Rom gegenüber der deutschen Hauptstadt eindeutig bevorzugte. Die Vertreter des Deutschen Reichsausschusses für Olympische Spiele (DRafOS), die keinerlei offizielle Unterstützung vorweisen konnten, erkannten die Aussichtslosigkeit der Berliner Bewerbung und zogen diese am 22. Juni 1904 während der IOC-Session in London zurück. Rom erhielt den Zuschlag per Akklamation.', 'Das römische Organisationskomitee zeichnete sich jedoch durch völlige Untätigkeit aus und löste sich im Januar 1906 sogar auf. Spätestens nach dem Ausbruch des Vesuvs am 7. April 1906 wären die Spiele in Rom ohnehin nicht mehr finanzierbar gewesen, da sämtliche verfügbaren Geldmittel in den Wiederaufbau der östlichen Vororte von Neapel flossen. Berlin bewarb sich nicht wieder, da der DRafOS der Ansicht war, die Finanzierung und der Bau eines neuen Stadions seien in den verbleibenden zwei Jahren nicht mehr zu bewerkstelligen. Das IOC drohte vor einem Scherbenhaufen zu stehen, bis die British Olympic Association (BOA) einsprang und in Geheimverhandlungen anbot, zusammen mit den britischen Sportverbänden die Spiele zu organisieren. Am 24. November 1906 gab die BOA mit einer offiziellen Pressemitteilung bekannt, dass die nächsten Olympischen Spiele in London stattfinden.', 'Organisation.', 'Am 19. November 1906, fünf Tage vor der Bekanntgabe der Durchführung, wählte der Vorstand des BOA seinen Vorsitzenden Lord Desborough zum Präsidenten des Organisationskomitees. Es bildeten sich fünf Ausschüsse für Finanzen, Programm, Unterbringung/Unterhaltung, Presse und Organisation. Vorgesehen waren 25 Sportarten, von denen Reiten, Luftschifffahren und Golf jedoch wieder gestrichen wurden. Da es damals für zahlreiche Sportarten noch keine internationalen Dachverbände gab, wurde beschlossen, ausschließlich die Reglemente der entsprechenden britischen Verbände anzuwenden.', 'Im Sommer 1908 sollte in London auch die Franco-British Exhibition stattfinden, eine große internationale Messe zur Festigung der vier Jahre zuvor vereinbarten Entente cordiale zwischen dem Vereinigten Königreich und Frankreich. Da sowohl Lord Desborough als auch Pierre de Coubertin im Organisationskomitee der Messe vertreten waren, bot es sich an, die beiden Veranstaltungen zusammen durchzuführen und so Synergien zu nutzen. Mit einer Konzentration der wichtigsten Sportarten auf zwei „Stadionwochen“ im Juli stellten die Organisatoren sicher, dass die sportlichen Wettkämpfe nicht zu einem unbedeutenden Anhängsel der Messe degradiert wurden.', 'Das Messegelände lag im westlichen Londoner Stadtteil White City. Das White City Stadium, das bis in die 1920er Jahre einfach als „The Stadium“ bezeichnet wurde, entstand am östlichen Rand des Geländes. Die Bauarbeiten am Stadion begannen am 31. Juli 1907 und dauerten rund neun Monate. Die Baukosten betrugen 44.000 £ und wurden von der Messeleitung übernommen, während die BOA die übrigen Kosten der Sportveranstaltungen trug. Die Messe begann am 14. Mai; am selben Tag betrat der Prince of Wales das Stadion und erklärte es für eröffnet. Als Generalprobe diente Ende Juni die Durchführung der britischen Leichtathletikmeisterschaften.', 'Wettkampfstätten.', 'Das White City Stadium, der zentrale Austragungsort, bot Platz für 66.288 Zuschauer von denen knapp 20.000 Plätze überdacht waren. Den äußersten Teil des Innenraums bildete eine Radrennbahn aus Beton mit überhöhten Kurven. Innerhalb dieser schloss sich eine Aschenbahn für die Laufwettbewerbe an. Auf dem Innenfeld in den Kurveninnenräumen befanden sich Sprung- und Wurfanlagen, ein Spielfeld für Ballsportarten sowie ein ungeheiztes Schwimmbecken mit versenkbarem Sprungturm. Im White City Stadium wurden die Wettkämpfe im Bogenschießen, Fußball, Hockey, Lacrosse, Radsport, Ringen, Rugby, Schwimmen, Tauziehen, Turnen, Wasserball und Wasserspringen sowie der Leichtathletik ausgetragen. Den Fechtern stand ein großes Zelt zur Verfügung, das auf dem Innenfeld aufgestellt wurde.', 'Die Organisatoren griffen für die übrigen Sportarten auf bereits bestehende Anlagen zurück. Die Wettkämpfe im Frühling fanden alle auf den Anlagen exklusiver Sportclubs im Westen Londons statt: das Poloturnier im Hurlingham Club und Rackets, Hallentennis und Jeu de Paume im Queen’s Club. Für das Rasentennis war ursprünglich ebenfalls das White City Stadium vorgesehen, doch der Boden war zu uneben, um darauf spielen zu können. Aus diesem Grund wich man auf den All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club aus, dem Austragungsort des Wimbledon-Tennisturniers. Die Wettbewerbe im Schießen waren auf zwei Standorte verteilt. Die Gewehr- und Pistolendisziplinen fanden in Bisley in der Grafschaft Surrey, das Tontaubenschießen im \\"Uxendon Shooting School Club\\" bei Harrow in der Grafschaft Middlesex statt.', 'Die Wettbewerbe im Rudern wurden auf der traditionsreichen Strecke der Henley Royal Regatta auf der Themse bei Henley-on-Thames ausgetragen. Die Segelwettbewerbe waren ebenfalls auf zwei Standorte verteilt; die drei kleineren Bootsklassen im Solent vor der Isle of Wight, die größte Bootsklasse im Firth of Clyde an der Westküste Schottlands. Die Motorbootrennen fanden im Southampton Water statt, einem schmalen Meeresarm vor der Stadt Southampton.', 'Eine Sporthalle des \\"Northampton Institute\\", der heutigen City University, diente als Austragungsort der Wettkämpfe im Boxen. Da im \\"Prince’s Skating Club\\" im Stadtteil Knightsbridge die Möglichkeit bestand, Eis künstlich zu erzeugen, war es erstmals möglich – 16 Jahre vor den ersten Winterspielen in Chamonix – mit Eiskunstlauf eine Wintersportart bei Olympischen Spielen durchzuführen.', 'Teilnehmer.', 'Böhmen, Österreich und Ungarn waren zwar Bestandteile des Staates Österreich-Ungarn, doch wurden die Resultate von Sportlern dieser Länder in den Statistiken getrennt geführt. Zu den ungarischen Resultaten werden gemäß der damaligen territorialen Ausdehnung Ungarns auch die Resultate von Athleten aus der Vojvodina und der Slowakei hinzugerechnet. Die Regierung in Wien forderte kurz vor Beginn der jeweiligen Turniere die Fußballmannschaften Böhmens und Ungarns sowie die Wasserballmannschaften Österreichs und Ungarns auf, ihre Anmeldungen zurückzuziehen, weil sie eine Zunahme nationalistischer Tendenzen beim möglichen Aufeinandertreffen von Mannschaften der einzelnen Reichsteile befürchtete.', '25 Sportler aus Australien und vier aus Neuseeland bildeten unter der Bezeichnung \\"Australasien\\" eine gemeinsame Mannschaft mit einer eigens zu diesem Zweck geschaffenen Flagge. Diese organisatorische Maßnahme war auch 1912 in Kraft; erst seit 1920 treten beide Länder getrennt auf. Finnland und Russland waren in Personalunion miteinander verbundene Staaten, sandten jedoch getrennte Mannschaften. Zahlreiche irische Sportler weigerten sich, für das Vereinigte Königreich anzutreten und ließen sich zuvor in den USA einbürgern.', 'Als Mitglied der Mannschaft Dänemarks nahm erstmals ein Sportler aus dem damals noch nicht unabhängigen Island an Olympischen Spielen teil. Das Osmanische Reich war möglicherweise mit dem griechischstämmigen Türken Aleko Moullos vertreten. Der offizielle Bericht nennt ihn als Teilnehmer beim Einzelmehrkampf der Turner, sein Ergebnis wurde jedoch nicht erfasst. Gesichert ist hingegen die erstmalige Teilnahme eines Sportlers aus Argentinien, des in England lebenden Eiskunstläufers Hector Torromé.', 'Es nahmen nur 43 Frauen teil. Diese waren lediglich in den Sportarten Bogenschießen, Eiskunstlauf, Segeln, Tennis und Motorbootrennen startberechtigt. Mehrere Frauenteams führten Gruppenübungen im Turnen vor, die jedoch als Demonstrationssportart betrachtet und deshalb nicht gewertet wurden.', 'Medaillen und Auszeichnungen.', 'Für die Olympischen Sommerspiele in London wurden insgesamt 250 Goldmedaillen sowie je 260 Silber- und Bronzemedaillen hergestellt.

Tagebautätigkeiten gestalteten seit der zweiten Hälfte des 19. Jahrhunderts die Landschaft dieses Urstromtals und der angrenzenden Sander vollkommen um. Die ältesten Gesteine entstammen dem jungen Präkambrium und sind etwa 600 bis 700 Millionen Jahre alt. Dabei handelt es sich um metamorphe Grauwacke in 150 bis 200 Metern Tiefe. Darüber gibt es eine Schichtlücke, die das Zeitalter vom Paläozoikum bis zum Mesozoikum umfasst. Diese ist auf fehlende Sedimentation oder auf Erosion zurückzuführen. Darüber lagern tertiäre Sedimente in denen vier Braunkohleflöze eingelagert sind. Das jüngste ist das Lausitzer Oberflöz (1. Lausitzer Flözhorizont), das bereits in den vergangenen 120 Jahren vollständig abgebaut wurde. Dieses Flöz hatte eine durchschnittliche Mächtigkeit von 22 Metern. Das Lausitzer Unterflöz (2. Lausitzer Flözhorizont) ist durch pleistozäne Erosion durch das eiszeitliche Schmelzwasser in eine Vielzahl von Feldern zerschnitten worden. Der 3. Lausitzer Flözhorizont ist in der Senftenberger Gegend nicht stark ausgeprägt; teilweise besteht er nur aus Schluff. Der vierte und älteste Flözhorizont wird aufgrund seiner tiefen Lage nicht abgebaut. Über diesem Flözhorizont lagerten sich die Spremberger Schichten (helle Tone und grobe Sande) ab. Diese bildeten sich durch die Heraushebung und einsetzende Verwitterung des Oberlausitzer Berglandes. Das abgetragene Material wurde nach Norden in das tertiäre Meer transportiert, das die Gegend um Senftenberg bedeckte. Über den Spremberger Schichten lagern der Braunkohleschluff (3. Flözhorizont) und darüber die Briesker Schichten. Dabei handelt es sich um 30 bis 40 Meter hohe Meeressedimente (Glimmersande). Diese Schichten werden vom 2. Flözhorizont bedeckt, der durch die Raunoer Schichten abgeschlossen wird. Die Raunoer Schichten bestehen aus hellem Ton und Quarzsand und entstanden durch erneute Hebungen im weiter südlich gelegenen Oberlausitzer Bergland.

Die Teilwörter \\"sumpften\\" und \\"Burg\\" sollten die naturräumlichen Gegebenheiten der Stadtentwicklung erklären. Die \\"Burg\\", in deren Schutz sich die Stadt entwickelte, war von den \\"Sumpf\\"gebieten Laugk und Haag umgeben. Die Flüsse Schwarze Elster, Storchelster und Wolschinka speisten die Sümpfe, so dass Senftenberg wie eine Insel von Wasser und Sümpfen umgeben war.', 'Der sorbische Name Senftenbergs lautet \\"Zły Komorow\\". Dafür gibt es die beiden möglichen Übersetzungen „Schlimmer Mückenort“ und „Schlimme Kammer“. Die erste Variante ist auf die naturräumliche Lage Senftenbergs in Sumpfgebieten und das damit verbundene starke Auftreten von Mücken zurückzuführen (altsorbisch \\"komor, komar\\" = „Mücke“).

Diese Siedlung war durchgehend von ungefähr 650 Personen bewohnt. Die Grabungen am Burgwall von Senftenberg leitete Alfred Götze aus Berlin.', 'Mittelalter.', 'Senftenberg wurde im Zuge der deutschen Ostsiedlung gegründet. Die Siedlung Senftenberg entwickelte sich im Schutze einer Burg (heute das Schloss der Festungsanlage), die deutsche Ritter errichteten.

Durch Senftenberg führte von West nach Ost die \\"Via Regia Lusatiae Inferioris\\" (Niederstraße). Da die Stadt im Norden und Osten durch Gewässer (Schwarze Elster und Storchelster) und Sümpfe (z. B. den Laugk) geschützt war, verlief die Stadtmauer südlich und westlich der Stadt mit jeweils einem Stadttor im Osten und Westen. Das Stadttor im Westen hieß Kreuztor und das im Osten Schlosstor.

This was because some people were worried that they might help Japan during the war. The Japanese Americans were treated unfairly, and their rights were taken away. The incarceration of Japanese Americans was a violation of their constitutional rights. Japanese Americans were treated unfairly and had their rights violated during World War II. The President and government justified making camps and incarcerating them. As history would show, this was an unfounded fear fueled by anti Japanese racism (pg. 1). The government only incarcerated the Japanese because of the paranoia and fear of the Pearl Harbor attacks. There were also anti Japanese clubs that influenced this. They were violated by the 5th amendment and “deprived of life, liberty, [and] property”. The Japanese were forcibly taken from their homes and forced to camps. Their property was also taken away which makes their rights violated. This is one out of many examples of how Japanese Americans rights were violated during WW2. The Japanese Americans struggled to fight for their own rights. “The government had denied all Japanese American citizens this right by forcing them into camps without any trial or judicial hearing” (pg. 16). The Japanese were forced to not fight for their own rights and forced to live in camps. This proves that the government was fueled by anti-Japanese racism. “The 6-3 ruling claimed that incarceration was a military necessity” (pg. 18). Japanese Americans were still seen as disloyal at the time. The government was also probably still paranoid about Pearl Harbor which made them think it was necessary to incarcerate them. In conclusion, the Japanese struggled to fight for their own rights. Japanese Americans faced harsh living conditions and loss of personal freedoms in the incarceration camps. Life in the camps was crowded and uncomfortable, with families forced to live in small, bare-bones barracks that were “cramped, and sound moved easily through the flimsy wooden dividers” (pg. 12). The living conditions in the camps were far from ideal, lacking privacy and basic resources. This further demonstrates the unjust treatment of Japanese Americans and the violation of their rights to a decent standard of living. Japanese Americans were subjected to strict regulations and loss of personal freedoms, such as limited movement and restrictions on cultural practices. Moreover, Japanese Americans were subjected to strict regulations and loss of personal freedoms, such as limited movement and restrictions on cultural practices which made them “[use] the few resources they had to find meaningful activities while living in the camps” (pg. 12). The incarceration camps imposed oppressive rules on Japanese Americans, infringing on their freedom of movement and expression. These restrictions stripped them of their individual liberties and further solidified the violation of their constitutional rights. The harsh living conditions and loss of personal freedoms experienced by Japanese Americans in the incarceration camps provide additional evidence of the violation of their constitutional rights. In conclusion, the incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II was a clear violation of their constitutional rights. They were treated unfairly, had their rights disregarded under the pretext of national security, and endured harsh living conditions in the incarceration camps.","completion":"This injustice continued even after the war ended, as many Japanese Americans faced prejudice and discrimination upon returning to their communities.

Erfolgreichster deutscher Athlet war Konrad Frey. Der Kunstturner errang drei Goldmedaillen, eine Silbermedaille und zwei Bronzemedaillen. Neben der sportlichen Bedeutung waren die beiden im Deutschen Reich stattfindenden Winter- und Sommerspiele 1936 besonders dadurch gekennzeichnet, dass sie von Hitler und der NSDAP dazu instrumentalisiert wurden, den NS-Staat im Ausland positiv darzustellen, während im Inland die NS-Propaganda vorwiegend die Leistungen der deutschen Olympiateilnehmer und -sieger hervorhob.', 'Wahl des Austragungsortes.', 'Bereits die VI. Olympischen Spiele 1916 waren vom Internationalen Olympischen Komitee (IOC) nach Berlin vergeben worden. Mitten in die Vorbereitungen fiel der Beginn des Ersten Weltkriegs, der schließlich zur Absage der Spiele führte. Nach Kriegsende schloss das IOC Deutschland als „offiziellen Kriegsverursacher“ aus der olympischen Gemeinschaft aus. Der Bann dauerte bis 1925. Seit der Wiederaufnahme in das IOC beschäftigte sich die Führung des Deutschen Olympischen Ausschusses mit dem Gedanken, die Spiele erneut nach Berlin zu holen. Theodor Lewald, Präsident des Ausschusses, schrieb am 25. Februar 1929 einen Brief an Oberbürgermeister Gustav Böß, in dem er eine wiederholte Bewerbung Berlins vorschlug.', 'Beim Ende Mai 1930 in Berlin stattfindenden IX. Olympischen Kongress stellte die Reichshauptstadt ihre Kandidatur vor. Reichsinnenminister Joseph Wirth legte den Plan in seiner Eröffnungsrede im Audimax der Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität dar, ohne allerdings konkret auf einen Austragungsort oder das Jahr der Spiele einzugehen. Die Bewerbung für 1936 wurde erst am Abend bei einem Bankett im Roten Rathaus ausgesprochen. Zu diesem Zeitpunkt hatten sich außer Berlin auch Alexandria, Barcelona, Budapest, Buenos Aires, Dublin, Frankfurt am Main, Helsinki, Köln, Lausanne, Nürnberg, Rio de Janeiro und Rom beworben. Ein Jahr später, zur 30. Session des IOC in Barcelona, waren aber nur noch vier Kandidaten übrig geblieben. Als dann auch noch Budapest und Rom ihre Kandidaturen zurückzogen, kam es zu einer Stichwahl zwischen Barcelona und Berlin.', 'Eine erste Abstimmung ergab eine Mehrheit für Berlin. Da aufgrund der Unruhen in Spanien bei diesem Treffen jedoch nur 20 der damals 67 IOC-Mitglieder anwesend waren, schlug IOC-Präsident Henri de Baillet-Latour mit Zustimmung der beiden deutschen Delegierten vor, den abwesenden Mitgliedern die Möglichkeit einer telegrafischen Abstimmung oder einer Briefwahl einzuräumen. Die endgültige Auszählung der Stimmen fand am 13. Mai 1931 im Sitz des IOC in Lausanne in Anwesenheit von Bürgermeister Paul Perret und IOC-Vizepräsident Godefroy de Blonay statt. Schließlich hatten sich 43 IOC-Mitglieder für Berlin und 16 für Barcelona entschieden sowie 8 der Stimme enthalten.', 'Aufruf zum Boykott.', 'Als das offizielle Ergebnis der Abstimmung über die Vergabe der XI. Olympischen Spiele 1936 nach Berlin bekannt gegeben wurde, schien die Durchführung der Spiele nach den Grundsätzen der „olympischen Idee“ für das Deutschland der Weimarer Republik noch möglich zu sein. Nach der Machtergreifung Hitlers am 30. Januar 1933 rief aber insbesondere in den USA die Diskriminierung der Juden eine Welle der Empörung und Verachtung hervor und führte zu Überlegungen, die Olympischen Spiele in Deutschland zu boykottieren. Eine breite Öffentlichkeit, aus der die Fair-Play-Bewegung hervorging, hatte erhebliche Zweifel an der Einhaltung und Achtung der „Olympischen Charta“ durch Deutschland und forderte Chancengleichheit für alle Teilnehmer, unabhängig von Konfession und Rasse. IOC-Präsident Henri de Baillet-Latour sah sich deshalb auf der 32. Tagung des IOC vom 5. bis 7. Juni 1933 in Wien dazu bewegt, eine mögliche Verlegung der Olympischen Spiele 1936 auf die Tagesordnung zu setzen, sollte die deutsche Reichsregierung nicht bereit sein, eine schriftliche Garantieerklärung abzugeben, die Regeln der „olympischen Idee“ einzuhalten. Außenpolitisch kompromissbereit, verpflichtete sich die NS-Regierung, die olympischen Regeln konsequent zu erfüllen. Sie versprachen freien Zugang für alle Rassen und Konfessionen in die Olympiamannschaften sowie Duldung eines politisch unabhängigen Organisationskomitees (OK). Dies wurde in der Praxis jedoch nicht umgesetzt. Von dieser Zusage auf Verwaltungsebene war Hitler nicht informiert, so dass sich nach seinem längeren Gespräch mit dem IOC-Mitglied Gen. Charles H. Sherrill ein erheblicher Streit anbahnte, den erst der Reichssportführer beendete, indem er feststellte, dass Juden die \\"moralische Qualität\\" fehle, Deutschland zu vertreten.', 'Eine besondere Rolle spielten deutsche linksintellektuelle Emigranten in Frankreich, die vor allem im „Pariser Tageblatt“ gegen die Durchführung der Olympischen Spiele in Deutschland protestierten. Um diese verschiedenen Aktivitäten gegen die Austragung der Olympischen Spiele 1936 in Berlin zu koordinieren, gründete sich am 7. Dezember 1935 in Paris das „Comité international pour le respect de l’esprit olympique“. Es bestand aus Mitgliedern der Komitees zur Verteidigung der olympischen Idee Großbritanniens, Frankreichs, der Niederlande, der skandinavischen Länder, der Tschechoslowakei sowie der Schweiz und hatte auch Verbindung zum US-amerikanischen Fair-Play-Komitee.', 'Das Komitee unterstützte auch die Vorbereitungen der als Gegenolympiade geplanten Volksolympiade vom 19. bis 26. Juli 1936 in Barcelona, die wegen des einsetzenden Spanischen Bürgerkrieges abgebrochen werden musste, sowie die antifaschistische Kunstausstellung „de olympiade onder dictatuur“ in Amsterdam. Insgesamt blieb dieser Widerstand jedoch chancenlos gegenüber der nationalsozialistischen Propagandamaschinerie, der das IOC gerne Glauben schenkte.', 'Größeres Gewicht kam da den Boykottbestrebungen in den USA zu, die bereits 1933 begonnen hatten und durch die Verabschiedung der „Nürnberger Rassengesetze“ vom 15. September 1935 nachhaltig bekräftigt wurden. Hier hatte sich eine breite Fair-Play-Bewegung gebildet, die von den großen Sportverbänden der „Amateur Athletic Union“ (AAU), der größten Gewerkschaftsorganisation „American Federation of Labor“ (AFL), Universitäten und prominenten Sportlern getragen wurde. Der damalige Präsident der AAU, Avery Brundage, übernahm die Terminologie der Olympiagegner und forderte seinerseits „Fair Play for American Athletes“, indem man sie zu den Olympischen Spielen reisen lassen solle, um dort zu zeigen, dass das freiheitliche amerikanische System dem Faschismus überlegen sei. Ein Boykott der Olympischen Spiele in Deutschland durch die USA hätte einen erheblichen Imageverlust für das nationalsozialistische Regime bedeutet. Die US-amerikanische Regierung wollte ausdrücklich keinen Einfluss auf die Diskussion nehmen und stellte der AAU die Entscheidung über Teilnahme oder Boykott frei. Auf der Jahreshauptversammlung der US-amerikanischen „Amateur Athletic Union“ sollte im Dezember 1935 über die Olympiateilnahme der USA entschieden werden. Als Avery Brundage in seiner Funktion als Vorsitzender des US-amerikanischen NOKs und ein entschiedener Befürworter einer US-Teilnahme sah, dass er die Abstimmung möglicherweise verlieren würde, verzögerte er die Entscheidung um einen Tag. Über Nacht zitierte er per Telegramm weitere stimmberechtigte Delegierte herbei. Die Befürworter setzten sich am 8. Dezember 1935 mit 58:56 Stimmen gegen die Boykottunterstützer um AAU-Präsident Jeremiah T. Mahoney durch und die USA nahmen an den Olympischen Spielen in Berlin teil. Die meisten anderen Nationen schlossen sich darauf dieser Haltung an. Nur die Sowjetunion sagte ihre Teilnahme ab, wie zuvor schon bei allen Olympischen Spielen nach dem Ersten Weltkrieg.', 'Mit der Abwehr des Boykotts der US-Mannschaft war es für Avery Brundage nicht getan. Er sorgte dafür, dass eine „vorzeigbare“ Mannschaft antrat, d. h. ohne jüdische Sportler. Für das Finale der 4-mal-100-Meter-Staffel der Männer waren zwei jüdische Sprinter aufgestellt worden: Sam Stoller als Startläufer, Marty Glickman als zweiter. Doch am Tag vor dem Finale wurden sie aus der Staffel genommen.', 'Fackellauf.', 'Idee und Route.', 'Zu diesen Olympischen Spielen fand zum ersten Mal ein olympischer Fackellauf statt. Nach der Idee von Carl Diem wurde eine olympische Fackel in Griechenland entzündet und durch 3400 Fackelläufer zur Eröffnungsveranstaltung nach Berlin getragen. Der Lauf führte durch sieben Länder über eine Distanz von 3075 Kilometern. Die Strecke war von Mitarbeitern des Propagandaministeriums festgelegt und vermessen worden.', 'Der Lauf begann in Olympia (20. Juli) und führte über die Stationen Athen, Delphi, Sofia (25. Juli), Belgrad (27. Juli), Budapest (28. Juli), Wien (29. Juli) und Prag (30. Juli). Am 1. August um 11:42 Uhr erreichte die Fackel das Berliner Stadtgebiet.', 'Bevor das olympische Feuer ins Olympiastadion gebracht wurde, feierte man seine Ankunft in einer „Weihestunde“ mit 20.000 Hitlerjungen und 40.000 SA-Männern im Lustgarten. Zwei „Altäre“, einer im Lustgarten und einer vor dem gegenüberliegenden Berliner Stadtschloss, wurden von Fackelläufer Siegfried Eifrig entzündet. Sie brannten während der gesamten Olympischen Spiele.', 'Der Schlussläufer des Fackellaufes war der Leichtathlet Fritz Schilgen, er entzündete während der Eröffnungsveranstaltung die olympische Flamme. Anschließend brachten Fackelläufer die Flamme zu den olympischen Wettkampfstätten in Kiel (2. August) und Berlin-Grünau (7. August).', 'Die Fackel.', 'Entworfen hatten die Fackel Walter E.

An den Nordflanken bildeten sich jedoch Gletscher, deren Nährgebiet wohl unter den steilen Nordabfällen zwischen Schillereck, Hochsengs und Seehagelmauer lag und sich nach Osten bis unter den Hohen Nock hin fortzog. Es wird angenommen, dass während des Hochglazials dieser „Sengsengebirgs-Gletscher“ in einem Westabschnitt sich wenigstens bis in den Talboden von Hopfing erstreckte. Entsprechende Moränenreste finden sich oberhalb der verfallenen Almfläche Mistleben, an den Feichtauer Seen sowie auf der Hochfläche Feichtau. Die Moränenreste im Hochkar unter dem Hohen Nock gehören zu einem Ostabschnitt, der in das Blöttenbachtal nach Osten abfloss.

Die Klimadaten zeigen eine für die Gebirge der Nördlichen Kalkalpen typische Temperatur- und Niederschlagsverteilung: kühle und niederschlagsreiche Sommer und niederschlagsarme Winter. Die Jahresniederschläge bewegen sich in einer Größenordnung von 1200 bis knapp 2100 mm, wobei der Niederschlag kontinuierlich mit der Seehöhe zunimmt. Maximalwerte werden im Bereich Rohrauer Größtenberg und Hoher Nock erreicht. In freien höher gelegenen Bereichen dominieren West- und Nordwestwinde, die häufig mit Niederschlag einhergehen. Bedingt durch den oftmaligen Wolkenstau am Kalkalpen-Nordrand fällt im Bereich des Hauptkammes über dem Hopfingboden für die Höhenlage überdurchschnittlich viel Schnee. Auf der Feichtaualm () kann die Schneebedeckung auf eine durchschnittliche Dauer von 174 Tagen geschätzt werden. Schneehöhen von drei Metern sind keine Seltenheit. Die Südseite profitiert bei Nordstaulage oftmals von deutlich besserem Wetter und weist auch geringere Niederschlagsmengen als die Nordseite auf.

In der Folge richtete Mexiko erfolgreich sportliche Großereignisse aus: 1954 fanden die Zentralamerika- und Karibikspiele und im März 1955 die Panamerikanischen Spiele in Mexiko-Stadt statt. Auf den daraus resultierenden Erfahrungen und den existierenden guten Sportstätten basierte die zweite Bewerbung um Olympische Spiele im Jahr 1955 bei der IOC-Session in Paris. Nachdem Mexiko-Stadt im ersten Wahlgang aber nur sechs Stimmen erhalten hatte, wurde die Kandidatur zurückgezogen. Für die Olympischen Spiele 1964 bewarb sich Mexiko-Stadt nicht erneut, unternahm aber eine Bewerbung um die Olympischen Sommerspiele 1968.', 'Unter der Leitung des Staatspräsidenten Adolfo López Mateos wurde eine 180 Seiten umfassende Broschüre erstellt, in der die Bewerbung von Mexiko-Stadt begründet und ausführlich dargestellt wurde. Sie wurde am 7. September 1962 beim IOC eingereicht. Diese Art der Präsentation war zu dieser Zeit noch nicht üblich, sie enthielt neben den Antworten auf den IOC-Fragebogen auch Informationen zur Geschichte des Landes, Darstellungen der Sportstätten, Klimainformationen und ärztliche Informationen über die Auswirkungen der Höhe auf die Sportler. Zudem ließ López Mateos bereits am 28. Mai 1963 ein provisorisches Organisationskomitee gründen, um die Ernsthaftigkeit der Bewerbung zu unterstreichen. Des Weiteren erklärte sich Mexiko bereit, die Kosten für einen früheren Aufenthalt der Mannschaften zur Akklimatisierung an die Höhenlage zu übernehmen.', 'Die Entscheidung über den Austragungsort fiel auf der IOC-Session 1963 in Baden-Baden. Die Versammlung war kurzfristig nach Deutschland verlegt worden, nachdem der eigentliche Austragungsort Nairobi nach Konflikten um die Teilnahme Südafrikas ausgefallen war. Bei der Abstimmung am 18. Oktober, vor der erstmals Fragen an die Kandidaten gerichtet werden konnten, setzte sich Mexiko-Stadt bereits im ersten Wahlgang mit 30 Stimmen gegen die Mitbewerber Detroit, Lyon und Buenos Aires durch. Diese Entscheidung war eine Überraschung. Lyon und Detroit hatten keine Chance, da sie in Ländern lagen, die aufgrund der NATO-Mitgliedschaft nach der Krise 1961 infolge des Baus der Berliner Mauer und nach Einschränkung für die Westmächte Athleten aus der DDR blockiert hatten.

Die Leitung übernahm erst das IOC-Mitglied José Clark Flores, während das Präsidentenamt des Organisationskomitees vorerst unbesetzt blieb. Als Vizepräsidenten wurden Agustín Legorreta und Pedro Ramírez Vázquez eingesetzt, die außerdem die Finanz- beziehungsweise die Bauverwaltung leiteten. Nach der Präsidentschaftswahl im Jahr 1964 ernannte das neu gewählte Staatsoberhaupt Gustavo Díaz Ordaz, der Schirmherr des Organisationskomitees war, seinen Vorgänger Adolfo López Mateos zum Präsidenten des Organisationskomitees. Dieser musste aber Mitte 1966 von diesem Amt zurücktreten, weil er schwer erkrankt war. Seine Nachfolge als OK-Präsident übernahm Pedro Ramirez Vázquez. Wichtige Entscheidungen behielt sich jedoch der mexikanische Präsident vor. Kurz nach der Ernennung wies der IOC-Präsident Ramirez Vázquez darauf hin, dass das negative Image der Olympiavorbereitungen verbessert werden müsse. Auf einer Pressekonferenz versicherte dieser daraufhin, dass die Olympiavorbereitungen im sozial verträglichen Rahmen bleiben würden. Er veränderte die Ausrichtung von Mateos Ziel – eine Erhöhung der Ausgaben als Antrieb für wirtschaftlichen Aufschwung und Stadtentwicklung – hin zu Effizienz und Nützlichkeit und wollte verstärkt auf bereits bestehende kulturelle Ressourcen und Infrastruktur zurückgreifen. Mexiko sollte nicht dem japanischen Beispiel mit hohen Ausgaben und hoher Verschuldung folgen. Dieser Wandel in der Herangehensweise erhielt auch die öffentliche Unterstützung des IOC-Präsidenten. Eine der ersten Ankündigungen von Ramirez Vázquez war außerdem die Kulturolympiade, mit der er das Engagement der Mexikaner und deren Unterstützung der Olympischen Spiele stärken wollte. Zudem sollte sie auch nach außen hin wirken und der Kritik ein positives Bild entgegensetzen.', 'Das Organisationskomitee hatte ab dem 25. Juli 1967 den Rang einer Staatsorganisation.

So entstanden das Centro Deportivo Olimpico Mexicano und das olympische Dorf Libertador Miguel Hidalgo mit den Hallen für die Wettbewerbe im Ringen und Boxen. Wegen Diskussionen um die Finanzierung kam es bei den Bauarbeiten jedoch zu Verzögerungen, die zusammen mit dem Hinweis auf die Höhenproblematik etwa das Olympische Komitee der USA erklären ließen, dass es bereit sei, die Austragung der Spiele kurzfristig zu übernehmen.', 'Insgesamt kosteten die Olympischen Spiele 1968 2,189 Milliarden Pesos, von denen die Regierung 710,2 Millionen Pesos übernahm. Außerdem wurden Einnahmen von 128,8 Millionen Pesos erzielt, wovon 80,2 Millionen auf den Verkauf der Fernsehrechte entfielen. Die 2,189 Milliarden Pesos, etwa 176 Millionen Dollar, waren ein Bruchteil der Aufwendungen Japans für die Olympischen Spiele 1964. Dennoch war es eine für das Land bedeutende Summe, die auch in den vor Beginn der Olympischen Spiele aufkommenden und dann niedergeschlagenen Studentenprotesten ein Hauptkritikpunkt war.', 'Mexikanische Innenpolitik.', 'Der mexikanische Präsident Gustavo Díaz Ordaz, dessen Amtszeit von 1964 bis 1970 reichte, war eng in die Organisation der Olympischen Spiele eingebunden. Er war aber kein Unterstützer der Spiele, sondern betrachtete diese als Hinterlassenschaft der Vorgängerregierung von Adolfo López Mateos, der ein starkes Interesse an der Austragung Olympischer Spiele im Land hatte. Mateos übernahm dann auch die Führung des Organisationskomitees nach dem Ende seiner Amtszeit. Er sah die finanziell aufwendige Ausrichtung der Olympischen Spiele 1964 in Tokio, die zu einem Schub in der Stadtentwicklung geführt hatte, als ein Vorbild für die mexikanische Hauptstadt an. Die Frage der Schwerpunktsetzung für die nationale Entwicklung wurde aber politisch und in den mexikanischen Medien kontrovers diskutiert. Als sich zwei Jahre nach der erfolgreichen Bewerbung kaum Fortschritte bei den Vorbereitungen abzeichneten und noch weniger positive Effekte der Austragung, sondern vermehrt interne und ausländische Kritik geäußert wurde, überlegte Präsident Díaz Ordaz im späten Sommer 1965, die Unterstützung für die Spiele einzustellen. Avery Brundage hingegen blieb optimistisch, vor allem auch aufgrund der engen Verzahnung des Nationalen Olympischen Komitees von Mexiko und der mexikanischen Politik. Die finanziellen Probleme und der Mangel an Glaubwürdigkeit wurden erst Ende Juni 1966 gelöst, als López Mateos seine Posten an der Spitze des Organisationskomitees aufgab. Offizieller Grund dafür waren gesundheitliche Probleme, jedoch wurde der Bruch zwischen Präsident und dem Vorsitzenden des Organisationskomitees und der Streit über die Finanzierung der Olympischen Spiele als Grund angenommen. Am 16. Juli 1966 verkündete Präsident Díaz Ordaz, dass Pedro Ramírez Vázquez der neue OK-Chef werden sollte. Dieser hatte kaum Verbindungen zum Internationalen Olympischen Komitee und der olympischen Bewegung. Er war zwar ein Mitglied des Systems, stand als Architekt zugleich aber etwas außerhalb.', 'Mexiko war das erste Entwicklungsland, das Olympische Spiele ausrichten durfte. In den 1960er-Jahren galt Mexiko als Land, das möglicherweise die Modernisierungstheorie erfüllen und sich in enger Anbindung an die USA erfolgreich wirtschaftlich und demokratisch entwickeln könnte.

Dabei trägt S-MAC dem Umstand Rechnung, dass im Gegensatz zu den Annahmen von PAMAS in der Regel nur ein einziger Kommunikationskanal zur Verfügung steht und bricht mit dem Prinzip der Fairness in Rechnernetzen. In gewöhnlichen Rechnernetzen konkurrieren verschiedene Benutzer und Prozesse um das gemeinsame Medium, so dass eine faire Medienzugriffsregelung sinnvoll ist. In Sensornetzen gibt es jedoch nur eine einzige, netzweite Anwendung, die gewissermaßen mit sich selbst konkurriert, und deren Gesamtziel Vorrang hat vor der Fairness gegenüber einzelnen Netzknoten.', 'Sensornetze sind bislang ein Forschungsgebiet ohne praktische Anwendungen, so dass auch S-MAC ausschließlich von akademischem Interesse ist. Die Stärke des Entwurfs lag vor allem darin, eine Ausgangsbasis für eine ganze Reihe ähnlich gelagerter weiterer Protokolle zu schaffen: T-MAC, WiseMAC, DSMAC, B-MAC, μ-MAC, M-MAC und Z-MAC orientierten sich nicht nur namentlich an ihrem gemeinsamen Vorreiter. S-MAC wurde unter anderem mit TinyOS implementiert, einem Betriebssystem speziell für Sensorknoten, und wird als „Urahn“ der spezialisierten Sensornetzprotokolle gerne für Vergleiche herangezogen.', 'Protokollaufbau.', 'Das Protokoll beruht auf der Rendezvous-Technik, die auch in anderen Anwendungsgebieten der Informatik zum Einsatz kommt. Ein Netzwerkknoten, der eine Nachricht senden möchte, schickt zunächst eine \\"Sendeanfrage\\" (RTS, \\"request to send\\") an den Adressaten. Bei Empfangsbereitschaft antwortet der Angesprochene darauf mit einer \\"Sendebestätigung\\" (CTS, \\"clear to send\\"). Daraufhin versendet der Sender das eigentliche Datenpaket, das der Empfänger mit einer \\"Empfangsbestätigung\\" (ACK, \\"acknowledgement\\") quittiert. Diese Verabredung zum Datenaustausch versichert dem Sender, dass der Adressat wirklich zuhört und ermöglicht es dem Empfänger, eine Datensendung ohne Zutun abzulehnen, weil er gerade anderweitig kommuniziert.', 'Der Rest des Protokolls ist in drei Aufgabenbereiche gegliedert: Tagesablauf, Kommunikationsstörungen und Nachrichtenübermittlung.', 'Tagesablauf.', 'Sensorknoten besitzen die Fähigkeit, in einen Standby-Modus zu wechseln, in dem alle Bauteile bis auf die Uhr abgeschaltet werden. In dieser „Schlafphase“ ist ihr Energieverbrauch minimal, sie sind aber inaktiv und können insbesondere keine Nachrichten entgegennehmen. S-MAC gibt den Sensorknoten mit regelmäßigen Wach-und-Schlaf-Zyklen einen festen „Tagesablauf“ vor. Dabei sollten möglichst viele Knoten demselben Tagesablauf folgen, um die sichere Kommunikation während der gemeinsamen Wachzeit zu gewährleisten.', 'Die Abstimmung der Tagesabläufe erfolgt über \\"Synchronisationsimpulse\\" (SYNCs), kurze Nachrichten mit dem sinngemäßen Inhalt: „Es ist jetzt … Uhr. Ich gehe in x Sekunden schlafen.“ Nach dem Anschalten wartet jeder Sensorknoten auf eine SYNC-Nachricht eines anderen Knoten. Empfängt er keine, sendet er nach einer zufälligen Zeitdauer selbst eine. Wer ein SYNC empfängt, passt sich dem darin angegebenen Tagesablauf an. War es das erste empfangene SYNC, ermittelt er den Zeitunterschied d zwischen seiner aktuellen Uhrzeit und der Uhrzeit der Nachricht und sendet ein neues SYNC mit Inhalt: „Es ist jetzt … Uhr. Ich gehe in x - d Sekunden schlafen.“ Jeder Knoten merkt sich die Tagesabläufe seiner Nachbarknoten, um bei Bedarf durch Bruch mit dem eigenen Tagesablauf Kontakt herzustellen.', 'Da mehrere Synchronisationsimpulse gleichzeitig oder zeitlich versetzt an verschiedenen Enden des Netzes starten können, kann das Netz bei diesem Verfahren in Verbünde zerfallen, die unterschiedlichen Tag-und-Nacht-Rhythmen folgen. An den Grenzen dieser Gruppen sitzen dann Sensorknoten, die den Tagesabläufen aller benachbarten Verbünde folgen. Dies stellt zwar die Kommunikation zwischen den Knotenverbänden sicher, da die Grenzknoten aber mehr Wachzeiten haben als innere Knoten verbrauchen sie mehr Energie und fallen früher aus.', 'Selbst elektronische Uhren gehen niemals völlig gleich. Es ist daher notwendig, durch erneute Synchronisationsimpulse das allmähliche „Auseinanderdriften“ der Uhrzeiten zu verhindern. S-MAC sieht dazu eine Aufteilung der Wachphase in zwei Unterphasen vor: Die kürzere erste ist für Versand und Empfang von Synchronisationsnachrichten bestimmt, die längere zweite für den eigentlichen Datenaustausch.', 'Häufig erneute Synchronisationsimpulse ermöglichen es zudem, neue Knoten bei fortlaufendem Betrieb in das Netz aufzunehmen. Sie empfangen ein SYNC des bestehenden Netzes und passen sich dem erhaltenen Tagesablauf an.', 'Kommunikationsprobleme.', 'Kommunikationsprobleme in Rechnernetzen führen zu Datenverlust und Energieverschwendung und müssen daher vermieden werden. S-MACs Rendezvousschema reduziert von Natur aus das Problem der Hidden Stations, weitere Bestandteile des Protokolls zur Vermeidung anderer Störungen werden im Folgenden dargestellt.', 'Datenkollisionen treten auf, wenn zwei Knoten gleichzeitig über das gemeinsame Kommunikationsmedium senden: Die Signale überlagern sich und beide Nachrichten werden unbrauchbar. Um Kollisionen zu vermeiden, baut S-MAC auf physische und virtuelle Trägerprüfung \\"(Carrier Sense)\\", also die Fähigkeit, eine Belegung des Kommunikationsmediums vor dem Senden auszuschließen. Dabei bezeichnet \\"physische\\" Trägerprüfung das tatsächliche kurze Abhören des Mediums, um eine anderweitige Nutzung auszuschließen, \\"virtuelle\\" Trägerprüfung das Vorausahnen anderer Kommunikation aufgrund vorweg bekanntgegebener Sendewünsche.', 'Die virtuelle Trägerprüfung vermeidet gleichzeitig Overhearing. Beim Overhearing verschwendet ein Knoten Energie, weil er Datenaustausch mitanhört, der nicht für ihn bestimmt ist und mit dem er nichts anfangen kann. Die virtuelle Trägerprüfung wird umgesetzt, indem in jeder Sendeanfrage gleichzeitig die Länge der zu sendenden Nachricht mitgeteilt wird. Mithörende Knoten können daraus schließen, wie lange das Kommunikationsmedium nach Beginn der Datenübertragung belegt sein wird, und können sich für diese Zeit schlafen legen. Dies wird mit Hilfe eines Netzbelegungsvektors (NAV, \\"network allocation vector\\") umgesetzt. Der NAV wird auf den in der Sendeanfrage mitgeteilten Wert gesetzt und über einen Zeitgeber nach und nach herunter gezählt. Erreicht der NAV den Wert 0, so ist das Medium laut virtuellem Carrier Sense frei und der Knoten wird aufgeweckt. Nach Rückversicherung mit dem physischen Carrier Sense kann der Knoten dann die eigene Datenübertragung anstoßen.', 'Nachrichtenübermittlung.', 'Bei Rechnernetzen ist es üblich, große zusammenhängende Dateneinheiten in kleine \\"Pakete\\" oder \\"Fragmente\\" aufzuspalten. Tritt beim Übermitteln einer großen Dateneinheit ein Fehler auf, so müssen alle Daten erneut gesendet werden, tritt in einem Paket ein Übermittlungsfehler auf, so genügt es, das einzelne Datenfragment zu wiederholen. Dieser Ansatz wird auch bei S-MAC verfolgt.

April 1966 an München, das sich gegen die Mitbewerber Montreal, Madrid und Detroit durchsetzte.', 'Die meisten Wettkämpfe wurden im Olympiapark München ausgetragen, mit dem Olympiastadion als zentrale Arena. Kiel-Schilksee war der Veranstaltungsort der Segelwettbewerbe. Die Wettbewerbe im Kanuslalom wurden in Augsburg ausgetragen. Die Fußballspiele fanden auch in Nürnberg, Augsburg, Ingolstadt, Regensburg und Passau statt.', 'Überschattet wurden die Spiele durch das Münchner Olympia-Attentat vom 5. September 1972, bei dem 11 israelische Athleten zunächst als Geiseln genommen und dann ermordet wurden. Die Spiele wurden nach einem Trauertag dennoch fortgesetzt.', 'Mit 121 teilnehmenden Mannschaften und 7170 Athleten stellten die Spiele von München einen neuen Teilnehmerrekord auf. Der herausragende Sportler der Spiele war der US-amerikanische Schwimmer Mark Spitz, der sieben Goldmedaillen gewann. Die Kunstturnerin Karin Janz aus der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik war mit zwei Gold-, zwei Silber- und einer Bronzemedaille die erfolgreichste deutsche Athletin.', 'Wahl des Austragungsortes.', 'Die Idee, München zum Austragungsort der Olympischen Sommerspiele zu machen, stammte von Willi Daume, dem Präsidenten des Nationalen Olympischen Komitees. Am 28. Oktober 1965 teilte er dem Münchner Oberbürgermeister Hans-Jochen Vogel seine Pläne mit. Viele Mitglieder des Internationalen Olympischen Komitees (IOC) seien nach der Anerkennung einer eigenen Olympiamannschaft der DDR bereit, sich für die Bundesrepublik Deutschland einzusetzen. Die Aussichten, die Spiele ins eigene Land zu holen, seien deshalb gut, aber in Frage käme dafür nur München. Hans-Jochen Vogels Einwand, München besitze praktisch keinerlei Anlagen für Olympische Spiele, entgegnete Willi Daume mit der Feststellung, dies sei eher ein Vorteil, weil das IOC lieber neue Stadien sehe als alte. Dem Oberbürgermeister war schnell klar, dass München damit eine große Chance geboten wurde.', 'Im Falle eines Erfolges würden auf die Stadt eine sechsjährige Phase enormer Belastungen und hoher finanzieller Aufwand zukommen. Auf der anderen Seite würden aber in einem kurzen Zeitraum und mit einem festen Fertigstellungstermin viele neue Anlagen geschaffen, welche die Stadt seit langem benötige. Da die Austragung der Olympischen Spiele in München also eine zusätzliche Schubkraft für die Entwicklung der Stadt bedeuten würde, stimmte der Oberbürgermeister der Bewerbung zu. Binnen weniger Wochen folgte auch die Zustimmung des Bundes, des Landes, des Nationalen Olympischen Komitees und auch des Stadtrats. Die Bewerbung wurde am 31. Dezember 1965 eingereicht, obwohl das IOC die Frist auf Bitten aus Wien, Amsterdam und Detroit bis zum 20. Januar 1966 verlängert hatte. Da die niederländische Regierung aber die Finanzierung ablehnte, kam es zum Rückzug der Amsterdam-Bewerbung (mit der Ankündigung, sich für 1976 erneut bewerben zu wollen).', 'In der 65. IOC-Sitzung in Rom fiel am 26. April 1966 die Entscheidung. Zur Wahl standen Detroit, Madrid, Montreal und München. 61 stimmberechtigte IOC-Mitglieder waren anwesend; um ein endgültiges Ergebnis zu erzielen, mussten mindestens 31 Mitglieder für eine Bewerberstadt stimmen. Vor der Entscheidung stellten sich die Bewerberstädte mit je einem Kurzfilm und einer Rede vor. Hans-Jochen Vogel sprach sechs Minuten lang frei auf Englisch, Willi Daume drei Minuten lang auf Französisch. Beide konnten sich so gegen die abgelesenen Reden ihrer Mitbewerber durchsetzen. Eine Komplikation war die Forderung von IOC-Präsident Avery Brundage, die Mannschaft der DDR nicht zu diskriminieren. Die Bundesregierung wollte sich wegen der Hallstein-Doktrin nicht schriftlich verpflichten, doch Vogel und Daume fanden einen älteren englischsprachigen Text des Bundesinnenministers und legten ihn Brundage vor, der damit zufrieden war.', 'Organisation.', 'Das Nationale Olympische Komitee für Deutschland beschloss am 19. Mai 1966 in Kassel die Gründung des „Organisationskomitees der XX. Olympischen Spiele München 1972 e. V.“, welches sich am 3. Juli 1966 im Münchner Rathaus konstituierte. Zu den 17 Gründungsmitgliedern gehörten unter anderem Bundesinnenminister Paul Lücke, der bayerische Kultusminister Ludwig Huber und Hans-Jochen Vogel als Oberbürgermeister von München. 1968 wuchs das Organisationskomitee durch die Berufung der Vertreter der olympischen Fachverbände auf 38 Mitglieder an. 1972, im Jahr der Olympischen Spiele, war Willi Daume Präsident des Organisationskomitees, Bundesinnenminister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Ludwig Huber und Hans-Jochen Vogel fungierten als Vizepräsidenten. Schirmherr war Gustav Heinemann, Bundespräsident der Bundesrepublik Deutschland. Nachdem vorübergehend nur eine Geschäftsstelle existierte, nahm am 1. Januar 1967 das Generalsekretariat seine Arbeit auf. Dieses verfügte über 13 Abteilungen, die jeweils in Referate unterteilt waren. Insgesamt waren hier mehrere Hundert Mitarbeiter beschäftigt.', 'Verkehr.', 'Die wichtigste Aufgabe der Abteilung „Verkehr“ war der Bau der Linie U3 im Netz der Münchner U-Bahn. Nach der Vergabe der Spiele an die bayerische Landeshauptstadt galt es, ein leistungsfähiges Verkehrsnetz aufzubauen. Der Stadtrat änderte mit seinem Beschluss vom 16. Juni 1966 die bisherigen Planungen und beschloss, dem Zubringer zum Olympiagelände Vorrang einzuräumen. Die eigentlich für das Jahr 1974 vorgesehene Eröffnung des ersten Netzabschnittes musste deutlich vorgezogen werden. Am 8. Mai 1972 erfolgte schließlich die Aufnahme des Betriebs auf der U-Bahn-Linie U3 zwischen \\"Münchner Freiheit\\" und \\"Olympiazentrum\\", nachdem zehn Tage zuvor auch die S-Bahn ihren Betrieb aufgenommen hatte. Diese führte bis zum eigens gebauten, aber heute aufgegebenen Bahnhof München Olympiastadion. Um dem Betrieb mit den erhöhten Anforderungen während der Olympischen Spiele gerecht zu werden, lieh man von der VAG aus Nürnberg vier Züge aus, die weitestgehend baugleich zu den Münchner Wagen waren. Während der Spiele verkehrte die U3 stets im Fünf-Minuten-Takt, bei wichtigen Veranstaltungen sogar im Zweieinhalb-Minuten-Takt. In 17 Tagen wurden etwa vier Millionen Besucher befördert.', '„Blaue Route“.', 'Da ein Autobahnring um München noch nicht existierte, wurde der Fernstraßenverkehr mit weiträumigen Umgehungen an München vorbeigelotst. Entlang dieser Strecken wurden die Hinweisschilder und Wegweiser an Bundesstraßen mit farbigen Punkten und Ringen gekennzeichnet. Zum Beispiel wurde die Bundesstraße 20 zwischen Straubing und Piding (bei Bad Reichenhall) südwärts mit einem blauen Punkt, nordwärts mit einem blauen Ring deutlich markiert, was der Strecke den Beinamen „Blaue Route“ eingebracht hat.', 'Finanzierung.', 'Bei der Finanzierung der Olympischen Spiele unterschied das Organisationskomitee zwischen „olympiabedingten Belastungen“ und „Investitionen“. Schon vor der Bewerbung war vereinbart worden, dass Bund, Land und Stadt je ein Drittel der Investitionen tragen, während das Organisationskomitee seinen Aufwand voll aus eigenen Einnahmen decken sollte. 1969 entschloss sich der Bund, seinen Anteil auf 50 % zu erhöhen, wodurch die Quoten für Land und Stadt auf je 25 % sanken. Das bedeutete für München eine erhebliche Entlastung. Die Eigenfinanzierung erfolgte hauptsächlich über das olympische Münzenprogramm, das der Deutsche Bundestag am 5. Februar 1969 beschlossen hatte. Im Gesetz war die Herausgabe von fünf Silbermünzen im Nennwert von je 10 DM festgelegt. Sie wurden von den Sammlern begeistert aufgenommen, sodass sich der Münzgewinn auf mehr als 731 Millionen DM belief. Davon kamen 8 Millionen DM dem Organisationskomitee zugute, 640 Millionen DM wurden zur Finanzierung der Wettkampfstätten verwendet. Die zweite große Einnahmequelle waren die Olympia-Lotterie und die Glücksspirale, bei denen es sich um eine Geld- und Sachwertlotterie handelte. Bei einer Teilnahmegebühr von 10 Pfennig betrug der Zweckertrag der Olympia-Lotterie bis zum Jahr 1974 etwa 250 Millionen DM. Durch die Glücksspirale wurden bei einem Lospreis von 5 DM in den Jahren 1970 bis 1972 insgesamt etwa 187 Millionen DM eingespielt. Weitere Einnahmequellen waren die Ausgabe von insgesamt 29 Briefmarken in sieben Serien und verschiedene Gedenkmedaillen. Sie und die normalen Einnahmen des Organisationskomitees erbrachten die Summe von rund 1,28 Milliarden DM. Weil fast 2 Milliarden DM benötigt wurden, musste nur noch rund ein Drittel der gesamten Kosten von den Steuerzahlern getragen werden.', 'Fackellauf.', 'Der olympische Fackellauf, der auf eine Idee des Sportfunktionärs Carl Diem (1882–1962) zurückgeht, war erstmals 1936 bei den Olympischen Spielen in Berlin durchgeführt worden. 1972 wurde in Griechenland eine olympische Fackel entzündet und durch 5917 Fackelläufer zur Eröffnungsveranstaltung nach München getragen. Der Lauf führte durch acht Länder über eine Distanz von 5532 Kilometern. Verantwortlich für die Organisation des Laufes war Hans-Werner von der Planitz, Reichstrainer der deutschen Marathonläufer in den 1930er Jahren. Einer seiner Mitarbeiter war Fritz Schilgen, der Schlussläufer des Fackellaufes von 1936.', 'Der Lauf begann am 28. Juli um 12 Uhr während einer Feierstunde im Heiligen Hain des antiken Stadions von Olympia. Das Feuer wurde mit Hilfe eines Hohlspiegels entzündet. Anschließend trugen 5976 Sportler die olympische Fackel insgesamt 5538 Kilometer weit – in 29 Tagen und 7 Stunden. Erster Fackelträger war der griechische Basketballspieler Ioannis Kirkilessis. Im Anschluss führte der Lauf unter anderem über die Stationen Athen (29. Juli), Delphi (30. Juli), Istanbul (7. August), Belgrad (17. August). Am 21. August kam es nach Österreich, wo es nach Plan um 10.10 Uhr durch Doppelolympiasiegerin Ellen Müller-Preis an der ungarischen Grenze in Nickelsdorf (bei starkem Regen und kühlen Temperaturen) übernommen wurde. Um 15.20 Uhr erreichte die Flamme die Stadtgrenze von Wien, wo sie von Sissy Schwarz in Empfang genommen und danach durch Herma Bauma auf den Rathausplatz gebracht wurde, wo durch Bundespräsident Franz Jonas die feierliche Verabschiedung der Olympiamannschaft erfolgte. Danach brachten andere prominente österreichische Sportler (wie u. a. Emmerich Danzer und Rudolf Flögel) die Flamme nach St. Pölten, wo sie „übernachtete“. Die nächste Station am 22.

Stattdessen sei der Ort Hanyang für die Hauptstadt einer zukünftigen Dynastie bestimmt. Der Stadt wurde im Norden durch einen Berg und im Süden durch einen Fluss Schutz geboten. Daher wurde 1394 Hanyang zur Hauptstadt Koreas ernannt und mit dem Bau eines neuen Palastes, des Gyeongbokgung, Tempeln und Stadtmauern begonnen. Die Mauer war 18 km lang und verband die vier Berge Bugaksan, Inwangsan, Namsan und Naksan, die die Stadt umgeben. Dort steht sie teilweise noch heute.

Die kalifornische Stadt hatte sich als einzige beim Internationalen Olympischen Komitee (IOC) um die Austragung dieser olympischen Sportwettkämpfe beworben. Es nahmen 140 Mannschaften mit 6797 Sportlern teil, davon 5230 Männer und 1567 Frauen.', 'Nach dem Olympiaboykott der USA und 41 weiterer Staaten bei den Olympischen Sommerspielen 1980 in Moskau und den 1983 eingeleiteten Maßnahmen US-amerikanischer Politiker zum Ausschluss sowjetischer Sportler boykottierte die Sowjetunion die Spiele von Los Angeles. Weitere 18 meist realsozialistische Staaten verweigerten ebenfalls die Teilnahme – nicht jedoch Rumänien, China und Jugoslawien. Obwohl mit 140 Nationen ein neuer Teilnahmerekord verzeichnet wurde, blieben allein mit den betroffenen Ostblockstaaten sowie Kuba sieben Mannschaften fern, die noch acht Jahre zuvor bei den letzten gemeinsamen Olympischen Sommerspielen 1976 in Montreal rund die Hälfte aller Medaillen gewonnen hatten. In zahlreichen Sportarten fehlte deshalb ein Großteil der Weltspitze. Es waren die letzten Olympischen Spiele mit einem großen Boykott.', 'In Los Angeles wurden die Olympischen Spiele erstmals privatwirtschaftlich finanziert, wobei sich das IOC der Kommerzialisierung öffnete. So nutzten in großem Umfang Sponsoren die Spiele für ihre Werbung.', 'Die erfolgreichsten Teilnehmer waren die rumänische Turnerin Ecaterina Szabó mit vier Gold- und einer Silbermedaille und der amerikanische Leichtathlet Carl Lewis mit vier Goldmedaillen.', 'Bewerbung.', 'Los Angeles in früheren Bewerbungen.', 'Los Angeles bemühte sich nach der Austragung der Olympischen Sommerspiele 1932 mehrmals vergeblich darum, erneut Austragungsort zu werden. 1932 waren rund eine Million Dollar Gewinn erzielt worden, weshalb ortsansässige Geschäftsleute die Olympischen Sommerspiele 1940 in die Stadt holen wollten. Dazu gründeten sie das Southern California Committee for the Olympic Games (SCCOG). Nach Ausbruch des Zweiten Weltkrieges geriet das Projekt jedoch in Vergessenheit. Nach dem Krieg bewarb sich Los Angeles dreimal erfolglos um die Ausrichtung: 1946 für die Olympischen Sommerspiele 1948, 1947 für die Olympischen Sommerspiele 1952 und 1949 für die Olympischen Sommerspiele 1956.', 'Nachdem das United States Olympic Committee (USOC) bei den folgenden vier Bewerbungen jeweils Detroit nominiert hatte und damit gescheitert war, bewarb sich 1970 wieder Los Angeles um die Ausrichtung der Olympischen Sommerspiele 1976. Bürgermeister Sam Yorty gründete das Bewerbungskomitee „LA76 Committee“ mit dem Vorsitzenden John Kilroy, einem Unternehmer und Sportler, das die Spiele anlässlich der 200-Jahr-Feier der Unabhängigkeitserklärung in die Staaten holen sollte. In der inneramerikanischen Ausscheidung beim USOC konnte sich Los Angeles durchsetzen. Beim IOC rief jedoch der Plan, die Olympischen Spiele mit einem privaten Fonds zu finanzieren, falls der Staat sich nicht beteiligen sollte, Misstrauen hervor. Bei der Wahl während der IOC-Session 1970 in Amsterdam schied Los Angeles mit nur 17 Stimmen in der ersten Runde aus, im zweiten Wahlgang gewann Montreal gegen Moskau.', 'Los Angeles unternahm nach dieser Niederlage einen neuen Anlauf und bewarb sich um die Olympischen Sommerspiele 1980. Die Chancen wurden durch die sportpolitische Situation gemindert, da die Sowjetunion verärgert auf das Scheitern Moskaus bei der Entscheidung 1970 reagiert hatte und einige IOC-Mitglieder sie nicht weiter verärgern wollten. So konnte sich Moskau bei der IOC-Session 1974 in Wien mit 39 zu 20 Stimmen bei zwei Enthaltungen gegen Los Angeles durchsetzen und die Sommerspiele 1980 ausrichten.', 'Bewerbung für 1984.', 'Für die Olympischen Sommerspiele 1984 ging Los Angeles erneut ins Rennen. Der Stadtrat sicherte dem SCCOG am 27. Oktober 1975 in einer Resolution seine Unterstützung zu und gab eine Studie zur Kosten-Nutzen-Analyse in Auftrag. Diese Studie gab ein erwartetes Defizit von 200 bis 336,5 Millionen Dollar an, da keine Unterstützung aus Staats- oder Bundesmitteln zu erwarten war, während das SCCOG einen Gewinn von 750.000 Dollar erwartete. Nachdem der SCCOG-Präsident John C. Argue versichert hatte, dass keine Steuermittel benötigt würden, stimmte der Stadtrat mit 12 zu 0 Stimmen bei drei abwesenden Olympiagegnern am 12. Mai 1977 für die Bewerbung um die Spiele. Im inneramerikanischen Auswahlverfahren beim USOC setzte sich Los Angeles am 25. September 1977 mit 55 zu 39 gegen New York City durch. Zuvor hatten sich Atlanta, Boston, Chicago und New Orleans aus dem Verfahren zurückgezogen. Beide Kammern des Kongresses unterstützten die Bewerbung von Los Angeles, was jedoch keine finanziellen Hilfen des Staates nach sich zog.', 'Wegen des finanziellen Verlustes bei den Olympischen Sommerspielen 1976 von Montreal, der weltweiten Wirtschaftskrise der Jahre 1974 und 1975 und der Forderung des IOC nach besseren Garantien gaben die Städte Algier, Glasgow und Riad ihre Bewerbungen auf. Im Juni 1977 zog sich mit Teheran der letzte Mitbewerber zurück, sodass Los Angeles zum Anmeldeschluss des IOC am 31. Oktober 1977 der einzig verbliebene Kandidat war. Im Vorfeld der 80. IOC-Session in Athen trafen sich die Führung des USOC, Vertreter der Stadt Los Angeles und Thomas Keller, der Präsident der General Association of International Sports Federations (GAISF), zu einem Gespräch, bei dem Keller für ihn unbefriedigende Antworten erhielt. Hinzu kam, dass 17 der 22 in der GAISF vertretenen Sportverbände das Konzept von Los Angeles ablehnten und vom IOC eine erneute Ausschreibung forderten. Die Olympischen Spiele wurden auf der IOC-Session am 18. Mai 1978 dennoch provisorisch an Los Angeles vergeben, nachdem US-Präsident Jimmy Carter und der Gouverneur Kaliforniens, Jerry Brown, ihre Unterstützung zugesagt hatten und das IOC Keller versichert hatte, dass Los Angeles alle Anforderungen der Olympischen Charta erfüllen müsse. Eine Bedingung war dabei, dass der Vertrag bis zum 1. August 1978 mit den olympischen Regeln übereinstimmen sollte, andernfalls wäre das Recht der Austragung wieder an das IOC zurückgefallen. Besonders um die finanzielle Haftung wurde gestritten, da weder das USOC noch die Stadt diese übernehmen wollten. Schließlich trat ein privates „Committee of Seven“ dem IOC als Verhandlungspartner gegenüber. Aus diesem wurde am 15. Juni 1978 das Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee (LAOOC), das mit den Plänen, die Wettkämpfe weitgehend in bestehenden Sportanlagen auszutragen, selbst den Fernsehvertrag auszuhandeln, auf ein zentrales olympisches Dorf zu verzichten und den Gewinn nicht an das IOC abzuführen, beim IOC auf wenig Gegenliebe stieß.', 'Es ließ sich jedoch kein alternativer Bewerber mehr finden, da New York die finanziellen Risiken zu groß waren und der Münchner Oberbürgermeister Erich Kiesl erfolglos versuchte, München als Austragungsort vorzuschlagen. Daher gab das IOC schrittweise nach: Die Frist für Los Angeles wurde erst auf den 21., dann auf den 31. August 1978 verlängert, bis schließlich in einer Briefwahl des IOC Los Angeles mit 75 Jastimmen, drei Gegenstimmen und sechs Enthaltungen die Olympischen Sommerspiele 1984 zugesprochen wurden. Der Stadtrat von Los Angeles stimmte mit acht zu vier Stimmen bei drei abwesenden Mitgliedern zu, und schließlich wurde am 20. Oktober 1978 im Weißen Haus der Vertrag zwischen Los Angeles und dem IOC durch Tom Bradley und Lord Killanin unterzeichnet.', 'Vorbereitung.', 'Organisation.', 'Am 26. Januar 1979 berief das LAOOC das 65 Personen umfassende Board of Directors, am 26. März 1979 wurde Paul Ziffren als Chairman und Peter Ueberroth als Präsident eingesetzt. Für die Organisation der Wettkämpfe bestimmte das LAOOC für die einzelnen Sportarten jeweils einen Kommissar. 1982 wurde dann für die Organisation der 25 einzelnen Tätigkeitsbereiche jeweils eine Subkommission eingerichtet. Als Sportdirektor war Michael O’Hara tätig, der 1964 selbst am olympischen Volleyballturnier teilgenommen hatte.', 'Wie schon während der Bewerbungsphase angekündigt, gab es kaum größere Bauprojekte. Das LAOOC wählte größtenteils bereits existierende Sportstätten im Großraum Los Angeles für die olympischen Wettbewerbe aus. Lediglich das Schwimmstadion, das Velodrom und die Tennisplätze wurden neu errichtet. Die beiden ersten wurden dabei jeweils von Sponsoren finanziert. Wie angekündigt errichtete das LAOOC kein zentrales olympisches Dorf, sondern verteilte die Sportlerunterkünfte auf drei Orte. Für den Aufenthalt der Athleten wollte das Organisationskomitee zunächst pro Tag 55 bis 58 Dollar verlangen, vier Jahre zuvor waren es noch umgerechnet 20 Dollar. Nach Protesten einiger IOC-Mitglieder senkte das LAOOC den Preis letztendlich auf 42 Dollar.', 'Zur Finanzierung schloss das LAOOC mit 34 Unternehmen Sponsorenverträge ab. So zahlte Coca-Cola 25 Millionen Dollar und Anheuser-Busch 15 Millionen Dollar, weitere Sponsoren waren unter anderem Canon, McDonald’s und American Express. Insgesamt erzielte das LAOOC damit 123 Millionen Dollar. Darüber hinaus verkaufte das Organisationskomitee an 64 Unternehmen Lizenzen. Das LAOOC und das USOC beantragten beim Kongress zudem die Prägung von Silbergedenkmünzen mit den Nennwerten 1 und 10 Dollar sowie Goldgedenkmünzen mit den Nennwerten 50 und 100 Dollar. Genehmigt wurden schließlich zwei silberne Ein-Dollar-Münzen zum Verkaufspreis von 32 Dollar und eine goldene Zehn-Dollar-Münze zum Verkaufspreis von 352 Dollar. LAOOC und USOC erhielten jeweils fünf Dollar pro verkaufter Silbermünze und 25 pro Goldmünze. Insgesamt übertraf das Ergebnis den erwarteten Gewinn von 150 Millionen Dollar, das LAOOC erwirtschaftete einen Gewinn von 232,5 Millionen Dollar. Statt dieses Geld wie zuvor üblich an das IOC abzuführen, gingen 60 % an das USOC. Mit den übrigen 40 % wurde die Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles \\"(LA84 Foundation)\\" gegründet, in der ehemalige hohe Mitglieder des LAOOC Positionen übernahmen.', 'Sportpolitik.', 'Boykott.', 'Die Olympischen Sommerspiele 1984 in Los Angeles stellten einen sportpolitischen Wendepunkt dar.

Es kommt unter anderem im Zentralnervensystem, Darmnervensystem, Herz-Kreislauf-System und im Blut vor. Der Name dieses biogenen Amins leitet sich von seiner Wirkung auf den Blutdruck ab: Serotonin ist eine Komponente des Serums, die den Tonus (Spannung) der Blutgefäße reguliert und zur Blutgerinnung beiträgt. Es wirkt außerdem auf die Magen-Darm-Tätigkeit und die Signalübertragung im Zentralnervensystem.', 'Geschichte.', 'Das Vorkommen eines Stoffes im Blut, der die Blutgefäße kontrahiert, wurde bereits Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts von Carl Ludwig angenommen. Vittorio Erspamer isolierte in den 1930er Jahren einen Stoff aus der Schleimhaut des Magen-Darm-Trakts, der die glatte Muskulatur kontrahieren lässt. Er nannte ihn „Enteramin“. 1948 isolierten Maurice Rapport, Arda Green und Irvine Page eine Blutgefäße kontrahierende Substanz und gaben ihr den Namen „Serotonin“. Die Struktur dieser Substanz, die Maurice Rapport vorschlug, konnte 1951 durch chemische Synthese bestätigt werden. Kurz darauf konnte Vittorio Erspamer zeigen, dass das von ihm gefundene Enteramin und Rapports Serotonin identisch sind. Irvine Page und Betty Twarog gelang 1953 mit dem Nachweis von Serotonin im Gehirn eine weitere wichtige Entdeckung.', 'Nach der Entdeckung des Serotonins wurden die für seine Wirkung verantwortlichen Rezeptoren intensiv untersucht. John Gaddum führte eine erste Unterscheidung in „D“- und „M“-Rezeptoren ein. Doch erst mit der Etablierung molekularbiologischer Methoden in den 1990er Jahren wurde offensichtlich, dass beim Menschen mindestens 14 verschiedene Serotonin-Rezeptoren existieren, die für die vielfältigen Wirkungen des Serotonins verantwortlich sind.', 'Vorkommen.', 'Serotonin ist in der Natur weit verbreitet. Bereits einzellige Organismen wie Amöben können Serotonin produzieren. Als Produzenten gelten ebenso Pflanzen und höhere Pilze. In den Brennhaaren der Brennnessel ist Serotonin für deren bekannte Wirkung mitverantwortlich. Zu den serotoninreichsten pflanzlichen Lebensmitteln zählen Walnüsse, die über 300 µg/g Serotonin enthalten können. Aber auch Kochbananen, Ananas, Bananen, Kiwis, Pflaumen, Tomaten, Kakao und daraus hergestellte Produkte wie beispielsweise Schokolade, enthalten mehr als 1 µg/g Serotonin. Der ungewöhnlich hohe Serotoningehalt, speziell bei Walnüssen, wird mit einem spezifischen Abbaumechanismus von entstehendem Ammoniak zu erklären versucht. Serotonin-Derivate treten gelegentlich auch als Nebeninhaltsstoff in psychoaktiven pflanzlichen Drogen auf, wie z. B. DMT, 5-MeO-DMT und Bufotenin in Yopo, einem psychoaktiven Rauschmittel aus der Pflanze \\"Anadenanthera peregrina\\". Für weitere Abkömmlinge des Serotonins, wie Feruloylserotonin und 4-Cumaroylserotonin, wird eine Funktion als Phytoalexin zum Schutz vor Mikroorganismen angenommen.', 'Im Tierreich ist Serotonin in nahezu allen Spezies anzutreffen. Es ist hier einer der phylogenetisch ältesten Neurotransmitter und kommt, wie auch seine Rezeptoren, im Nervensystem bereits so einfacher Vertreter wie dem Fadenwurm \\"C. elegans\\" vor. Es wird vermutet, dass das Serotoninsystem, bestehend aus Serotonin und seinen Rezeptoren, bereits im Präkambrium vor über 700 Millionen Jahren entstand.', 'Im menschlichen Organismus kommt die größte Menge an Serotonin im Magen-Darm-Trakt vor. Hier werden etwa 95 % der gesamten Serotoninmenge des Körpers, die auf 10 mg geschätzt wird, gespeichert. Etwa 90 % des Serotonins des Magen-Darm-Trakts werden in den enterochromaffinen Zellen gespeichert, die übrigen 10 % sind in den Nervenzellen (Neuronen) des Darmnervensystems zu finden. Das Serotonin des Bluts ist fast ausschließlich auf die Thrombozyten (Blutplättchen) verteilt. Dieses Serotonin wird von den enterochromaffinen Zellen des Magen-Darm-Trakts produziert und nach Abgabe in das Blut von den Thrombozyten aufgenommen. Auch basophile Granulozyten und Mastzellen können, zumindest bei Nagetieren, Serotonin speichern und freisetzen. Im Zentralnervensystem befindet sich Serotonin insbesondere in den Neuronen der Raphe-Kerne. Eine pathologisch vermehrte Produktion, Speicherung und Freisetzung von Serotonin kann häufig bei neuroendokrinen Tumoren des Magen-Darm-Trakts, den Karzinoiden, beobachtet werden und ist für deren charakteristische Begleitsymptomatik verantwortlich.', 'Chemie.', 'Chemische Eigenschaften.', 'Serotonin gehört – wie auch das Tryptamin – zur Gruppe der Indolamine bzw. Tryptamine. Serotonin ist wegen seiner primären aliphatischen Aminogruppe eine schwache Base. Seine Säurekonstante pKS von 10,4 ist mit der des Tryptamins vergleichbar. Daher liegt Serotonin unter physiologischen Bedingungen in überwiegend protonierter Form vor. In seiner protonierten Form ist Serotonin zur Fluoreszenz befähigt. Diese Eigenschaft wird auch zu seinem Nachweis genutzt. Das Absorptionsmaximum liegt bei 309 nm und das Emissionsmaximum bei 336 nm.', 'Synthese.', 'Für die synthetische Herstellung von Serotonin sind zahlreiche Wege beschrieben. Zu den grundlegenden Strategien der Serotoninsynthese zählen insbesondere die Ergänzung des Indolkörpers um die β-Ethylamin-Komponente, die Hydroxylierung von Tryptamin und die Synthese eines Indolgrundgerüsts aus verschiedenen möglichen Vorläufersystemen.', 'Synthesewege, die auf der Einführung der β-Ethylamin-Komponente basieren, beginnen mit 5-Hydroxyindol, dessen Hydroxygruppe entweder vorzugsweise mit einer Benzyl-Gruppe oder seltener mit einer Methyl-Gruppe geschützt ist. Das Erstere wird hydrogenolytisch gespalten, das Letztere bevorzugt mit Bortribromid. Die erste Laborsynthese, im Jahr 1951 von Hamlin und Fischer durchgeführt, bedient sich der Mannich-Reaktion zur Herstellung des entsprechenden Gramins in einem ersten Syntheseschritt. Dieses wird dann zur Kettenverlängerung mit Cyanid in wässrigem Alkohol und anschließender Hydrolyse zu 5-Benzyloxyindol-3-acetamid umgesetzt. Nach Reduktion des Amids und anschließender Etherspaltung lässt sich das Serotonin isolieren.', 'Gemäß einer fast zeitgleichen Veröffentlichung von Merrill E. Speeter und Mitarbeitern wird zunächst 3-(5-Benzyloxy)indolyl-magnesiumiodid als Grignard-Reagenz hergestellt und dann mit Chloracetonitril zum entsprechenden 3-Acetonitrilindol umgesetzt. Das Nitril wird reduziert und der Ether gespalten. Eine mit den vorstehenden Verfahren verwandte Variante mit verbesserten Ausbeuten beschreibt die Herstellung von radioaktiv markiertem [11C]-Serotonin für Positronen-Emissions-Tomographieuntersuchungen. Dabei wird 5-Methoxygramin an \\"N\\"2 zur quartären Ammoniumverbindung umgesetzt und mit [11C]-Cyanwasserstoff zu 5-Methoxy-3-acetonitrilindol nukleophil substituiert. Es folgt eine Etherspaltung und schließlich eine Reduktion. Eine Methode, die sich auf zwei Reaktionsschritte beschränkt, besteht in der Addition von Nitroethylen an 5-Benzyloxyindol mit nachfolgender Hydrierung. Das Nitrovinylindol, das als Zwischenprodukt auftritt, ist alternativ über eine Aldolkondensation des Indol-3-carbaldehyds mit Nitromethan zugänglich. Ferner existiert noch der probate Weg über die Friedel-Crafts-Acylierung mit Oxalylchlorid. Das auf solche Weise gewonnene 5-Benzyloxy-3-Indol-glyoxylylchlorid verbindet sich mit Dibenzylamin zum Amid, das reduziert und debenzyliert wird.', 'Eine andere Synthesestrategie beruht auf der Hydroxylierung von Tryptamin zum Serotonin. Nach dem Schutz der Aminfunktion zum \\"N\\"-Methoxycarbonyltryptamin wird dieses mit Triethylsilan zum entsprechenden Indolin reduziert. Die Oxidation desselben mittels Wasserstoffperoxid in Gegenwart von Natriumwolframat-Dihydrat bildet das Zwischenprodukt 1-Hydroxy-\\"N\\"-methoxycarbonyltryptamin. Die regioselektive nukleophile Hydroxylierung in 5-Position gelingt mit 85%iger Ameisensäure. Abschließende Hydrolyseschritte wie die alkalische Entschützung liefern das Serotonin.', 'Ein weiteres Herstellungsverfahren basiert auf einer Indolsynthese als abschließenden Schritt. 2,5-Dimethoxybenzaldehyd unterwirft man der Knoevenagel-Reaktion mit Cyanoacetat und addiert an den entstandenen Michael-Akzeptor Blausäure. Die Succinonitril-Verbindung wandelt man durch Hydrierung und Etherspaltung zum 1,4-Diamino-2-(2,5-dihydroxyphenyl)butan, welches dann mit Ferricyanid oxidativ in das Endprodukt überführt wird. Dieser Schlussschritt dürfte über das Chinon verlaufen, das intramolekular zum Imin kondensiert und zum Indol aromatisiert.', 'Abseits der erwähnten Pfade wurde der Aufbau eines Tryptolin-1-ons beschrieben, dessen Ringöffnung Serotonin hervorbringt. Auch gibt es den Aufbau einer zunächst aliphatischen bicyclischen Verbindung, die im späteren Verlauf zum Indol aromatisiert wird.', 'Biochemie und Pharmakokinetik.', 'Aufnahme.', 'Nach oraler Gabe wird Serotonin zu etwa 75 % in den Blutkreislauf aufgenommen und später nach Verstoffwechslung über den Urin ausgeschieden. Ähnliche Werte werden für die Aufnahme von Serotonin aus Lebensmitteln wie Bananen gefunden.', 'Biosynthese.', 'Beim Menschen und bei Tieren wird Serotonin aus der Aminosäure -Tryptophan in einer Zwei-Schritt-Reaktion unter Beteiligung der Enzyme Tryptophanhydroxylase und Aromatische--Aminosäure-Decarboxylase aufgebaut. Im ersten Schritt entsteht als Zwischenprodukt die nicht-proteinogene Aminosäure 5-Hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP). Im zweiten Schritt erfolgt eine Decarboxylierung zum Endprodukt Serotonin. Der wichtigste Produktionsort sind die enterochromaffinen Zellen der Darmschleimhaut. Von hier aus wird das produzierte Serotonin über die Blutplättchen transportiert. Eine Passage der Blut-Hirn-Schranke ist jedoch nicht möglich, sodass Serotonin auch im Zentralnervensystem produziert werden muss. Den Stellenwert der neuronalen Serotoninproduktion zeigt die Anwesenheit einer zweiten paralogen Tryptophanhydroxylase im Gehirn, die bereits vor der Entwicklung der Wirbeltiere durch Genverdopplung aus der ersten Isoform hervorging.', 'Die Biosynthese von Serotonin in Pflanzen weicht in der Reihenfolge ihrer Schritte von der in Tieren ab.

Mit den Weltmeisterschaften im Schießen 1978 und der Frauenbasketball-Weltmeisterschaft ein Jahr später hatte das Land seine ersten sportlichen Großereignisse ausgerichtet. Infolge des guten Gelingens der Schützen-Weltmeisterschaften wurde der Präsident des Schützenverbandes, Park Chong-kyu, im Februar 1979 sowohl zum Präsidenten des Olympischen Komitees Südkoreas (KOC) als auch zum Vorsitzenden der Korean Amateur Sports Association (KASA) gewählt. Er gab eine Machbarkeitsstudie in Auftrag, die die Eignung Seouls als Austragungsort prüfen sollte.', 'Im Juni 1979 gab das KOC diese Bestrebungen auf der Generalversammlung der Association of National Olympic Committees (ANOC) in San Juan bekannt.

Neuer Präsident des Bewerbungskomitees wurde Chung Ju-yung, der Vorsitzende der Hyundai-Gruppe und Präsident des Industriellenverbandes, dessen Überzeugungsarbeit sich vor allem auf die Entwicklungsländer konzentrierte. Das Bewerbungskomitee stellte diesen Ländern eine finanzielle Unterstützung der Olympiateilnahme in Südkorea in Aussicht.', 'Mit Blick auf die Olympischen Sommerspiele 1968 in Mexiko-Stadt wies das Bewerbungskomitee zudem darauf hin, dass Südkorea als Entwicklungsland die Olympischen Sommerspiele veranstalten könne. Zudem wies es Befürchtungen aufgrund der politischen Situation auf der Koreanischen Halbinsel und der Diktatur in Südkorea zurück. Ebenso wurde ein Olympiaboykott sozialistischer Staaten befürchtet, da Südkorea zu diesem Zeitpunkt keine diplomatischen Beziehungen zu ihnen unterhielt. Insgesamt räumte man der Bewerbung Seouls nur eine Außenseiterchance gegen den einzigen Mitbewerber, die japanische Stadt Nagoya, ein.', 'Die Wahl des Austragungsortes fand am 30. September 1981 in Baden-Baden statt. Im ersten Wahlgang setzte sich Seoul mit 52 zu 27 Stimmen gegen Nagoya durch. Als Grund für den überraschend klaren Wahlausgang wurden das arrogante Auftreten der japanischen Delegation, befürchtete Finanzierungsschwierigkeiten Nagoyas und allgemeine wirtschaftliche Interessen in Südkorea angeführt. Des Weiteren soll Horst Dassler, Chef des Adidas-Konzerns, Einfluss auf das Wahlverhalten ausgeübt haben, indem er bei Entwicklungsländern für Seoul als Austragungsort warb.

Der Bau der Sportstätten kostete 237.795 Millionen Won, die Austragung der Wettkämpfe 26.053 Millionen und das olympische Dorf und das Pressezentrum 30.931 Millionen. Daneben investierte der Staat weitere Milliarden in den Ausbau der öffentlichen Infrastruktur, wobei der Fokus auf dem Verkehr und dem Tourismus lag. Er machte Ausgaben zur Verbesserung des Umweltschutzes und der Standards im Gesundheitssystem. Zudem förderte der Staat auch kulturelle Institutionen und Veranstaltungen. Der vom Organisationskomitee erwirtschaftete Profit von 341,5 Milliarden Won ging an die am 20. April 1989 gegründete Seoul Olympic Sports Promotion Foundation.', 'Im Vorfeld der Olympischen Sommerspiele verschärfte der Staat die Maßnahmen für den Umweltschutz. So war es den Fahrern von 750.000 Privatautos nur jeden zweiten Tag erlaubt, diese zu benutzen. Ebenso veranlasste die Regierung die Schließung der mit Kohle beheizten Badehäuser drei Tage vor dem Marathonlauf, damit sich die Luftqualität zum Wettkampf besserte. Diese Anstrengungen galten jedoch nur im Vorfeld und für den Zeitraum der Spiele und wurden danach wieder zurückgenommen.', 'Sportpolitik.', 'In Vorbereitung auf die Spiele wurde darauf hingearbeitet, einen weiteren Olympiaboykott durch den Ostblock wie 1984 in Los Angeles zu verhindern. Dabei kam erschwerend das Fehlen diplomatischer Beziehungen Südkoreas zu sozialistischen Staaten hinzu. Das veranlasste den IOC-Präsidenten Juan Antonio Samaranch, sich für die Teilnahme dieser Staaten zu engagieren. So wurde bei der Versammlung der Nationalen Olympischen Komitees in Mexiko-Stadt im November 1984 die „Deklaration von Mexiko“ verabschiedet, in der die Teilnehmer unter anderem dem Austragungsort der Olympischen Sommerspiele 1988 zustimmten. Die Zustimmung der Sowjetunion kam einer Zusage der Teilnahme gleich, worauf jedoch verschiedene sozialistische NOKs mit Unverständnis reagierten. Die DDR hatte sich nach den Sommerspielen von Los Angeles bereits dazu entschlossen, in Seoul wieder teilzunehmen. Das IOC beschloss zudem, die Einladungen zu den Sommerspielen direkt zu verschicken, und überließ diese Aufgabe nicht wie bis dahin dem Organisationskomitee. Trotz dieser Entwicklungen dachte das IOC intern über die Möglichkeit nach, die Sommerspiele zu verlegen und die Eignung Münchens als Alternative zu sondieren.', 'Ein weiterer Konfliktpunkt war die Beteiligung Nordkoreas an der Ausrichtung der Olympischen Sommerspiele. Von Fidel Castro ermuntert, forderte Nordkorea Ende 1985 die Mitausrichtung. In der Folge kam es am 8. und 9. Januar 1986 in Lausanne zu einem vom IOC-Präsidenten geleiteten Gespräch der nord- und südkoreanischen Olympischen Komitees. Nordkorea forderte, dass elf der 23 olympischen Sportarten auf eigenem Territorium durchgeführt werden, und wollte zudem eine eigene Eröffnungs- und Abschlussfeier. Es sollte ein gemeinsames Organisationskomitee geben und eine vereinte Mannschaft antreten. Die Verhandlungen wurden auf weiteren Treffen fortgeführt, verliefen aber nicht erfolgreich, da das IOC die Forderungen Nordkoreas nicht erfüllte und nur etwa die Hälfte der gewünschten Sportveranstaltungen dem Norden zugestehen wollte. So blieb die Ausrichtung allein auf Seoul und Südkorea beschränkt. Nordkorea boykottierte nach den gescheiterten Verhandlungen über eine Beteiligung an der Austragung die Olympischen Sommerspiele von Seoul und wurde dabei von Kuba, Nicaragua und Äthiopien unterstützt, die mit ihren Mannschaften ebenfalls fernblieben. Diesem Boykott schlossen sich zudem Albanien und die Seychellen an. Um Sanktionen des IOC zu entgehen, verzichteten diese Staaten darauf, ihr Fernbleiben als Boykott zu bezeichnen. Bis zuletzt war die Teilnahme Madagaskars erwartet worden, weshalb noch bei der Eröffnungsfeier von 160 startenden Nationen ausgegangen wurde, das Land schloss sich jedoch dem nordkoreanischen Boykott an.', 'Während der 84.

Dynastie (Ägypten)', 'El-Lischt', 'Erbaut im 20. Jahrhundert v. Chr.', 'Ägyptische Pyramide'], 'Die Sesostris-I.-Pyramide (mittelägyptisch Senwosret-peter-taui) ist das Grabmal des altägyptischen Königs Sesostris I. aus der 12. Dynastie im Mittleren Reich. Sie wurde zwischen dem 10. und dem 25. Regierungsjahr Sesostris’ I. (circa 1909–1894 v. Chr.) in el-Lischt, etwa 1,6 km südlich der Pyramide seines Vaters Amenemhet I. errichtet. Erste wissenschaftliche Beschreibungen des Bauwerks erfolgten Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts. Großflächige Grabungen im Pyramidenkomplex fanden zwischen den 1890er- und 1930er-Jahren und nochmals in den 1980er- und 1990er-Jahren durch französische und US-amerikanische Forschungsteams statt. Die Grabungen erbrachten nicht nur Erkenntnisse zum ursprünglichen Aussehen der Grabanlage, sondern auch zu den Konstruktionsmethoden, zum Materialtransport und zur Arbeitsorganisation.', 'Die Pyramide Sesostris’ I. ist stark an Vorbilder des Alten Reichs, insbesondere der 5. und 6. Dynastie angelehnt, was vor allem an der Konzeption des Totentempels und dem Bau von Nebenpyramiden deutlich wird. Hierzu gehören neun Pyramiden für Königinnen und Königstöchter. Die meisten von ihnen sind so stark zerstört, dass heute nicht einmal die Namen der Besitzerinnen bekannt sind. Nur die Pyramide der Gemahlin des Herrschers Neferu und der Tochter Itakayt (I.) konnten mit Sicherheit identifiziert werden. Sesostris I. war der letzte altägyptische Herrscher, der eine Kultpyramide errichten ließ.', 'Der Grabbezirk weist einige architektonische Neuerungen auf. Hierzu zählt etwa die Gestaltung der inneren Umfassungsmauer, die in dieser Form weder vorher noch nachher verwendet wurde. Ebenso neu ist die Konstruktion des Oberbaus der königlichen Pyramide mit einer äußeren Stützkonstruktion aus Kalkstein-Streben. Die unterhalb der Pyramide gelegene Grabkammer ist nie freigelegt worden und heute vom Grundwasser überflutet. Grabräuberschächte deuten darauf hin, dass sie bereits im Altertum geplündert wurde.', 'Während und kurz nach der Regierungszeit von Sesostris I. entstanden im Umfeld der Pyramide mehrere große Mastaba-Gräber hoher Beamter. Im weiteren Verlauf des Mittleren Reiches und vereinzelt in der Zweiten Zwischenzeit und in der Römerzeit wurden zudem im königlichen Grabbezirk und in der Beamten-Nekropole zahlreiche einfache Schachtgräber angelegt. Für die Dritte Zwischenzeit und die Römerzeit ist außerdem durch Silos und Hausgrundrisse eine landwirtschaftliche Nutzung des Geländes nachgewiesen.', 'Forschungsgeschichte.', 'Eine erste Dokumentation der Pyramide führte 1839 John Shae Perring durch. Die Publikation erfolgte 1842 durch ihn selbst und durch Richard William Howard Vyse. Karl Richard Lepsius besuchte Lischt während seiner Ägypten-Expedition 1842–1846 und dokumentierte zwischen März und Mai 1843 die dortigen Ruinen. Die Sesostris-I.-Pyramide nahm er unter der Nummer LXI in seine Pyramiden-Liste auf.', 'Gaston Maspero stieß 1882 als Erster ins Innere der Pyramide vor. Erste systematische Ausgrabungen fanden 1894/95 unter Joseph-Étienne Gautier und Gustave Jéquier statt. Zwischen 1906 und 1934 grub ein Forschungsteam des Metropolitan Museum of Art in 14 Kampagnen in Lischt. Zehn davon unter der Leitung von Albert M. Lythgoe (1907–1914) und Ambrose Lansing (1916–1918 und 1923–1934) galten der Sesostris-I.-Pyramide, wobei damals außer Vorberichten keine Publikationen erschienen. Nachgrabungen gab es zwischen 1984 und 1987 unter Dieter Arnold. Bereits 1988 veröffentlichte er die erste vollständige Grabungspublikation der königlichen Pyramidenanlage. 1992 folgte unter Mitarbeit seiner Ehefrau Dorothea Arnold und seines Sohnes Felix Arnold ein weiterer Band zum Pyramidenkomplex. Felix Arnold legte zudem 1990 einen Band zu den im Pyramidenkomplex gefundenen Arbeiter-Inschriften vor.', 'Name.', 'Eine Besonderheit der Pyramiden der 12. Dynastie ist die Verwendung unterschiedlicher Namen für verschiedene Teile des Pyramidenkomplexes. Während die Anlagen des Alten Reiches lediglich einen Namen für den gesamten königlichen Grabkomplex besaßen, hatten die Anlagen der 12. Dynastie bis zu vier Namen, welche die eigentliche Pyramide, den Totentempel, die Kultanlagen des Bezirks sowie die Pyramidenstadt bezeichneten. Für die Sesostris-I.-Pyramide sind drei Namen überliefert: Die eigentliche Pyramide trug den Namen \\"Senweseret-peter-taui\\" („Sesostris schaut die beiden Länder“, Ober- und Unterägypten). Der Name \\"Chenem-isut-Cheperkare\\" („Vereinigt sind die Stätten des Cheperkare“ [Thronname Sesostris' I.]) bezeichnete sowohl den Totentempel als auch alle anderen Kultanlagen des Bezirks. Die Pyramidenstadt trug den Namen \\"Cha-Senweseret\\" („Sesostris erscheint“). Für den Namen des Totentempels und der Kultanlagen ist auch die Kurzform \\"Chenem-Isut\\" („Vereinigt sind die Stätten“) überliefert.', 'Baudetails.', 'Architektonische Vorbilder.', 'Mehr noch als sein Vater Amenemhet I. griff Sesostris I. die Grabbezirke des Alten Reichs als Vorbilder für seine Pyramidenanlage auf. Vor allem der Totentempel ist sehr stark an das Schema angelehnt, das sich seit Sahure zu Beginn der 5. Dynastie etabliert hatte. In seinen Proportionen gleicht er am stärksten den Totentempeln der Teti-Pyramide und der Pepi-I.-Pyramide aus der 6. Dynastie. Sesostris I. muss bei seinen Planungen direkt auf die Anlagen des Alten Reichs zurückgegriffen haben, entweder durch Vermessungen oder noch vorhandene Konstruktionspläne. Eine mittelbare Übernahme dieser Vorbilder durch eine Anlehnung an den Totentempel seines Vaters kann ausgeschlossen werden. Dieser ist zwar fast völlig zerstört und kann im Detail nicht mehr rekonstruiert werden, jedoch ist es durch seine geringen Ausmaße nicht möglich, dass er das Raumschema eines Totentempels des Alten Reichs vollständig übernommen hat. Der Totentempel der Sesostris-I.-Pyramide darf nicht als exakte Kopie der Anlagen des Alten Reichs verstanden werden, da er einige Neuerungen aufweist, etwa die starke Reduzierung der Magazinräume im äußeren Tempelbereich und die Verwendung von Osirisstatuen.', 'Einen weiteren Rückgriff auf das Alte Reich stellt der Bau von Nebenpyramiden dar. Sowohl eine Kultpyramide als auch Königinnenpyramiden fehlen bei Amenemhet I. Die Kultpyramide Sesostris’ I. ist die einzige des Mittleren Reichs und zugleich die letzte, die in Ägypten errichtet wurde. Im Gegensatz zu den Anlagen des Alten Reichs weist ihr Kammersystem keinen T-förmigen Grundriss mehr auf. Durch die Neukonzeption der Totentempel und Kammersysteme im späteren Verlauf der 12. Dynastie wurden Kultpyramiden überflüssig, da ihre Funktion von anderen Teilen des Grabkomplexes übernommen wurde. Auch mit der hohen Anzahl an Königinnenpyramiden orientierte sich Sesostris I. wieder sehr stark am Alten Reich, etwa an der Pepi-I.-Pyramide, während sein Vater für seine Frauen und Töchter lediglich Schachtgräber anlegen ließ. Allerdings weicht die Konzeption des Kammersystems von den Vorbildern ab, etwa in der Orientierung der Sarkophag-Kammern. Weiterhin sind die Kultanlagen stark zurückgenommen.', 'Beim Aufweg lässt sich ein auffälliger Umbau feststellen. Er war zunächst sehr breit und offen konzipiert und damit wohl dem Aufweg am Totentempel des Mentuhotep II. in Deir el-Bahari nachempfunden. Später wurde er verkleinert und überdacht und damit ebenfalls Vorbildern des Alten Reichs angepasst.', 'Wesentliche Neuerungen lassen sich hingegen beim Oberbau der königlichen Pyramide feststellen. Wie schon die Pyramide Amenemhets I. orientiert sie sich nicht mehr an der Standard-Größe der Anlagen des Alten Reichs, sondern ist deutlich größer konzipiert als diese. Die Konstruktion des Oberbaus stellt höchstwahrscheinlich ein vollständig neues Konzept dar. Der Aufbau der Amenemhet-I.-Pyramide ist weitgehend unerforscht. Vermutlich besteht sie aus einem fünfstufigen Kern mit einer Ummantelung. Die Sesostris-I.-Pyramide besitzt hingegen eine äußere Stützkonstruktion aus Kalksteinstreben, die den Pyramidenkern umschließen. Dieses System wurde von den nachfolgenden Herrschern der 12. Dynastie übernommen.', 'Chronologie der Bauarbeiten.', 'Bei den archäologischen Untersuchungen der Pyramide wurden an zahlreichen Steinblöcken Kontrollmarken der altägyptischen Handwerker gefunden, die wertvolle Einblicke in den Verlauf der Bauarbeiten liefern. Aus bislang ungeklärten Gründen begann Sesostris I. mit dem Bau seiner Pyramide nicht sofort nach seiner Krönung zum Ko-Regenten, sondern erst nach dem Tod seines Vaters. Das früheste Datum, auf Blöcken aus den Fundamenten der Pyramide und des inneren Hofs, stammt aus dem 10. Regierungsjahr. Die Arbeiten am Fundament dauerten kontinuierlich bis ins 14. Regierungsjahr an. Ab dem 11. Regierungsjahr wurde mit der Errichtung des Pyramiden-Oberbaus begonnen. Hier sind Kontrollmarken bis zum 13. Regierungsjahr erhalten. Die Marken aus den höheren Bereichen der Pyramide dürften dem massiven Steinraub zum Opfer gefallen sein.', 'Merkwürdigerweise wurden auch an den Königinnenpyramiden Kontrollmarken gefunden, die bereits in das 11. und 13. Regierungsjahr datieren. Da zu dieser Zeit die Arbeiten an der Königspyramide im vollen Gange waren, erscheint es eigenartig, dass der Platz um diese herum bereits so stark verbaut worden sein soll. Felix Arnold schlug deshalb vor, dass das Baumaterial für die Königinnenpyramiden zwar bereits sehr früh beschafft worden sei, zunächst aber gelagert wurde und der eigentliche Bau erst um das 22. Regierungsjahr begann.', 'Die Arbeiten am Totentempel begannen sehr früh und wurden kontinuierlich bis zum Ende des gesamten Bauprojekts fortgesetzt. Datumsangaben sind aus den Regierungsjahren 11, 12, 13, 16 und 24 überliefert. Letzteres ist gleichzeitig das höchste überlieferte Datum im Pyramidenbezirk. Arbeiten am oberen Ende des Aufwegs sind für das 22. Regierungsjahr bezeugt.', 'Zu den Regierungsjahren 15, 17 bis 21 und 23 sind keine Datumsangaben belegt. Das höchste überlieferte Datum dürfte in etwa mit dem Ende der Bauarbeiten zusammenfallen. Die Pyramidenanlage war somit nach einer etwa 14 bis 15 Jahre dauernden Bauzeit um das 25. Regierungsjahr Sesostris’ I. und damit 20 Jahre vor seinem Tod vollendet.', 'Dank der recht hohen Anzahl der: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"1.

Die Olympiade (von ) bezeichnet einen sich wiederholenden Zeitraum von vier Kalenderjahren, der erstmals am 1. Januar 1896 begonnen hat. Die Sommerspiele werden nach ihnen benannt, so beispielsweise die Olympischen Sommerspiele 2020, die offiziell Spiele der XXXII. Olympiade (die XXXII. Olympiade begann am 1. Januar 2020 und wird bis 31. Dezember 2023 dauern) heißen. Die Olympischen Spiele sind in ihrem Umfang stetig gewachsen, so dass mittlerweile fast jedes Land der Welt mit Sportlern vertreten ist. Neben den Fußball-Weltmeisterschaften gelten sie als das größte Sportereignis der Welt.', 'Die Einführung der Olympischen Spiele der Neuzeit wurde 1894 als Wiederbegründung der antiken Festspiele in Olympia auf Anregung von Pierre de Coubertin beschlossen. Als „Treffen der Jugend der Welt“ sollten sie dem sportlichen Vergleich und der Völkerverständigung dienen, sie ersetzten die seit 1856 stattfindenden Olympien. Seit 1896 finden alle vier Jahre Olympische Spiele und seit 1924 Olympische Winterspiele statt. Seit 1994 alternieren Winter- und Sommerspiele im zweijährigen Rhythmus. Eine Ausnahme bilden die 32. Olympischen Sommerspiele in Tokio. Diese hätten turnusgemäß 2020 stattfinden sollen, wurden aber wegen der COVID-19-Pandemie auf das Jahr 2021 verschoben. Das IOC übernimmt auch die Schirmherrschaft für die Paralympics als Wettkämpfe behinderter Sportler, der Deaflympics, Special Olympics und der World Games für nichtolympische Sportarten. Darüber hinaus gibt es seit 2010 die Olympischen Jugendspiele, die für Jugendliche im Alter von 14 bis 18 Jahren bestimmt sind.', 'Olympische Spiele der Antike.', 'Der Ursprung der Olympischen Spiele der Antike liegt vermutlich im 2. Jahrtausend v. Chr. Die Siegerlisten reichen bis ins Jahr 776 v. Chr. zurück und wurden im 4. Jahrhundert v. Chr. rekonstruiert. Die Zählung nach Olympiaden war ein Zeitmaß im gesamten antiken Griechenland. „Olympiade“ ist somit – entgegen einem heute weit verbreiteten Irrtum – nicht synonym mit „Olympische Spiele“, sondern bezeichnet den Zeitraum von vier Jahren, der mit den Spielen beginnt. Die Olympischen Spiele, benannt nach ihrem Austragungsort Olympia im Nordwesten der Halbinsel Peloponnes, waren Teil eines Zyklus, der drei weitere Panhellenische Spiele umfasste: Die Pythischen Spiele in Delphi, die Nemeischen Spiele in Nemea und die Isthmischen Spiele auf dem Isthmus von Korinth.', 'In der Anfangszeit gab es nur einen Wettlauf über die Distanz des Stadions (192,24 Meter). Die Spiele erhielten mit der Zeit eine immer größere Bedeutung. Sie waren aber keine „Sportveranstaltung“ in unserem heutigen Sinne, sondern ein religiöses Fest zu Ehren des Göttervaters Zeus und des göttlichen Helden Pelops. In ihrer Blütezeit dauerten die Spiele fünf Tage – der erste Tag war bestimmt von kultischen Zeremonien wie Weihehandlungen und dem Einzug der Athleten, Betreuer, Schiedsrichter und Zuschauer in den heiligen Hain von Olympia. Neben den Wettkämpfen – zuletzt waren es 18 in den Sportarten Leichtathletik, Schwerathletik, Pentathlon und Reiten – waren musische Wettbewerbe ebenso wichtig. Nicht der Sport als solcher stand im Mittelpunkt, sondern die religiöse Komponente.', 'Die eigentlichen Spiele begannen mit dem Umzug aller Beteiligten zum Tempel des Zeus. Hier schworen die Athleten, sich an die Regeln der Spiele zu halten. Die Sieger erhielten einen Siegeskranz (Kotinos) sowie ein Stirnband. Man sah sie als „von den Göttern begünstigt“ an und verewigte sie mit Gedichten und Statuen. Jede Niederlage, sogar schon ein zweiter oder dritter Platz, galt als untilgbare Schmach. Die Verlierer kehrten auf Schleichwegen in ihre Heimat zurück, um dem Spott zu entgehen, der sie erwartete. Als berühmtester Olympionike der Antike gilt der Ringer Milon von Kroton, der erste namentlich bekannte ist Koroibos.', 'Die antiken Spiele waren aus heutiger Sicht außerordentlich brutal, jeder Teilnehmer in den klassischen Kampfsportarten (Boxen, Ringen, Stockfechten, Pankration) musste auch mit dem Tod rechnen und teilweise wurden Kämpfer für ihr Durchhalten zum Sieger erklärt, nachdem ihr Tod im Kampf festgestellt worden war.', 'Als die Römer im Jahr 148 v. Chr. Griechenland eroberten, verloren die Olympischen Spiele ihren panhellenischen Charakter. Von nun an war es auch nichtgriechischen Athleten gestattet, teilzunehmen.', 'Im Jahr 393 wurden alle heidnischen Zeremonien, darunter auch die Olympischen Spiele, vom römischen Kaiser Theodosius I. verboten. Der Kultbetrieb in Olympia wurde aber wohl bis zum Anfang des 5. Jahrhunderts n. Chr. aufrechterhalten. Erst Theodosius II. verbot die Olympischen Spiele im Jahr 426 endgültig. Es gibt allerdings Anzeichen dafür, dass anschließend die Wettkämpfe heimlich und auf niedrigerem Niveau fortbestanden, bis Naturkatastrophen die Kultstätte im 6. Jahrhundert zerstörten.', 'Die Olympischen Spiele der Neuzeit.', 'Vorläufer.', 'Die olympische Idee ging nicht ganz verloren. So fanden im Westen Englands zu Beginn des 17. Jahrhunderts erstmals die \\"Cotswold Olympick Games\\" statt. Ein weiterer Versuch, die Olympischen Spiele wiederzubeleben, waren die \\"Olympiades de la République\\", die von 1796 bis 1798 jährlich im revolutionären Frankreich ausgetragen wurden. Auf diese Veranstaltung geht auch die Verwendung des metrischen Systems im Sport zurück. 1850 führte die landwirtschaftliche Lesegesellschaft von Much Wenlock in der englischen Grafschaft Shropshire eine „olympische Klasse“ ein. Daraus entwickelten sich zehn Jahre später die \\"Wenlock Olympian Games\\", die bis heute unter der Bezeichnung \\"Wenlock Olympian Society Annual Games\\" fortgeführt werden. 1866 organisierte William Penny Brookes, der Vorsitzende der Wenlock Olympian Society, nationale Olympische Spiele im Londoner Crystal Palace.', 'Das griechische Interesse an der Wiedereinführung der Olympischen Spiele erwachte nach der Griechischen Revolution gegen die Herrschaft des Osmanischen Reiches. Der Dichter und Verleger Panagiotis Soutsos machte den ersten entsprechenden Vorschlag in seinem 1833 veröffentlichten Gedicht „Dialog der Toten“. Als wichtigster Vorläufer der modernen Olympischen Spiele gelten die Olympien, die ihrerseits das Münchner Oktoberfest zum Vorbild hatten. Sie wurden vom wohlhabenden griechischen Kaufmann Evangelos Zappas ins Leben gerufen und durch eine königliche Verfügung von Otto I. als eine nationale Aufgabe von hohem Rang angesehen, die auch internationale Beachtung erfuhr. Die erste Ausgabe fand 1859 im Stadtzentrum Athens statt. Zappas ließ das Panathinaiko-Stadion instand setzen, das bis 1889 Austragungsort weiterer Olympien war.', 'Wiederbelebung der Spiele.', 'Nachdem 1766 die Sport- und Tempelanlagen von Olympia wiederentdeckt worden waren, begannen 1875 groß angelegte archäologische Ausgrabungen unter der Leitung des deutschen Archäologen und Althistorikers Ernst Curtius. Um diese Zeit kam in Europa die romantisch-idealistische Antiken-Rezeption immer mehr in Mode; der Wunsch nach einer Wiedererweckung des olympischen Gedankens verbreitete sich. Beispielsweise beim Volksfest „Die Lust am Drehberge“ bei Dessau 1776 bis 1799. So sagte Baron Pierre de Coubertin damals: \\"„Deutschland hatte das ausgegraben, was vom alten Olympia noch vorhanden war. Warum sollte Frankreich nicht die alte Herrlichkeit wiederherstellen?“\\" Nach de Coubertins Meinung war die mangelnde körperliche Ertüchtigung der Soldaten eine der Hauptursachen für die Niederlage Frankreichs im Deutsch-Französischen Krieg von 1870/71 gewesen. Er strebte danach, diesen Zustand durch die verbindliche Einführung von Sportunterricht an den Schulen zu verbessern. Gleichzeitig wollte er nationale Egoismen überwinden und zum Frieden und zur internationalen Verständigung beitragen. Die „Jugend der Welt“ sollte sich bei sportlichen Wettkämpfen messen und sich nicht auf den Schlachtfeldern bekämpfen. Die Wiederbelebung der Olympischen Spiele schien in seinen Augen die beste Lösung zu sein, um diese Ziele zu erreichen.', 'Die Wenlock Olympian Games, die de Coubertin 1890 besuchte, bestärkten ihn in der Ansicht, dass eine Wiedereinführung der Olympischen Spiele im großen Rahmen möglich sei. Er griff Brookes und Zappas’ Ideen auf und fügte selbst das Prinzip der Rotation zwischen verschiedenen Austragungsländern hinzu. De Coubertin präsentierte einer internationalen Zuhörerschaft seine Vorstellungen auf einem Kongress, der vom 16. bis 23. Juni 1894 in der Sorbonne-Universität in Paris stattfand und als erster Olympischer Kongress in die Geschichte einging. Am letzten Tag des Kongresses beschlossen die Teilnehmer, dass die ersten Olympischen Spiele der Neuzeit 1896 in Athen stattfinden sollten, also im Ursprungsland. Um die Spiele zu organisieren, wurde das Internationale Olympische Komitee (IOC) gegründet. Erster Präsident wurde der Grieche Dimitrios Vikelas, während de Coubertin zunächst als Generalsekretär amtierte.', 'Die ersten Spiele der Neuzeit erwiesen sich als großer Erfolg. Obwohl nur rund 250 Athleten teilnahmen, waren sie ein großes sportliches Ereignis. Die griechischen Offiziellen waren vom Erfolg derart begeistert, dass sie den Vorschlag machten, die Spiele zukünftig immer in Griechenland stattfinden zu lassen. Doch das IOC hielt am Rotationsprinzip zwischen verschiedenen Ländern fest.', 'Nach dem Anfangserfolg geriet die olympische Bewegung in eine Krise. Die Spiele von 1900 in Paris und 1904 in St. Louis waren in die parallel stattfindenden Weltausstellungen eingebettet. Die Wettkämpfe zogen sich über mehrere Monate hin, waren schlecht organisiert und wurden kaum beachtet, zudem nahmen in St. Louis nur wenige Ausländer teil. Bei den Olympischen Zwischenspielen 1906 in Athen standen die sportlichen Wettkämpfe wieder im Vordergrund. Das IOC stimmte der Austragung zwar widerstrebend zu, erkannte die Resultate jedoch nie offiziell an. Von manchen Sporthistorikern werden diese Spiele als Rettung der olympischen Idee angesehen, da sie das Absinken in die Bedeutungslosigkeit verhinderten.', 'Weitere Entwicklung.', 'Die Wintersportart Eiskunstlauf stand 1908 und 1920 auf dem Programm von Sommerspielen, Eishockey 1920.

Er ist 4884 Meter hoch und damit die höchste Erhebung des Kontinents.', 'Insbesondere aus kulturellen und politischen Gründen wird Australien mit den anderen Inselstaaten des Pazifiks unter der Bezeichnung „Ozeanien“ zu einem Kontinent zusammengefasst. Die Carstensz-Pyramide gehört zum Staat Indonesien und damit politisch gesehen eher zu Asien. Nach einer politischen Grenzziehung wäre demnach der Mount Wilhelm, der mit einer Höhe von 4509 Metern der höchste Berg Papua-Neuguineas ist, auch der höchste Ozeaniens. Die Idee, den Mount Wilhelm zu den Seven Summits zu zählen, hat jedoch kaum Unterstützung erfahren.', 'Die Listen von Bass und Messner.', 'Die erste Auflistung der Seven Summits stammt von Dick Bass und enthält neben dem asiatischen Mount Everest (auch als „Sagarmatha“ oder „Chomolungma“ bezeichnet), dem südamerikanischen Aconcagua, dem nordamerikanischen Denali (damals noch „Mount McKinley“ genannt), dem afrikanischen Kibo (umgangssprachlich „Kilimandscharo“) und dem antarktischen Mount Vinson den Elbrus als Vertreter Europas und den Mount Kosciuszko für den australischen Kontinent.', 'Ein Gegenvorschlag stammt von Reinhold Messner, der den Mount Kosciuszko durch den Puncak Jaya ersetzt, der auch \\"Carstensz-Pyramide\\" genannt wird. Dieser Vorschlag kann aus alpinistischer Sicht als größere Herausforderung verstanden werden, da die Besteigung der Carstensz-Pyramide als deutlich anspruchsvoller gilt als die des Mount Kosciuszko.', 'Der Besteigungs-Chronist Harry Kikstra favorisiert Messners Carstensz-Liste, führte aber zusammen mit Eberhard Jurgalski bis Ende 2011 Listen zu drei Varianten: Besteigungen nach der Messner-Liste, Besteigungen nach der traditionellen Liste von Bass sowie ein Verzeichnis jener Bergsteiger, die sowohl die Carstensz-Pyramide (Messner) als auch den Mount Kosciuszko (Bass) bestiegen hatten. In einer später veröffentlichten Liste, die den Stand Mitte 2016 wiedergibt, gab Kikstra nicht mehr an, welche von den drei Varianten jeweils absolviert wurde.', 'Die Listen von Bass beziehungsweise Messner können unter Bergsteigern als Referenzpunkte für die Seven Summits angesehen werden. Viele Seven-Summit-Sammler besteigen zusätzlich den Mont Blanc, der in keiner der beiden Listen enthalten ist.', 'Übersicht.', 'Tabelle.', 'Die folgenden neun Berge werden – je nach Definition – zu den Seven Summits gezählt. In den Spalten \\"LB\\" und \\"LM\\" sind die Berge markiert, die in den Listen von Bass bzw. Messner enthalten sind.', 'Die Seven Summits.', 'Mount Everest.', 'Der Mount Everest (nepalesisch \\"Sagarmatha\\"; tibetisch \\"Chomolungma\\") ist mit 8848 Metern über dem Meeresspiegel der höchste Berg der Erde und damit auch der höchste Asiens. Er ist der einzige Achttausender unter den Seven Summits und überragt den zweithöchsten Berg in der Liste um knapp 1900 Höhenmeter. Seine Lage im Himalaya markiert die Grenze zwischen Nepal und Chinas autonomem Gebiet Tibet; auf nepalesischer Seite liegt er im Sagarmatha-Nationalpark.', 'Die Besteigungsgeschichte des Mount Everest beginnt in den 1920er Jahren. Die Erstbesteigung gelang dem Neuseeländer Sir Edmund Hillary gemeinsam mit dem nepalesischen Sherpa Tenzing Norgay am 29. Mai 1953. Die Schwierigkeiten seiner Besteigung liegen in geringen Temperaturen, plötzlichen Wetterumschwüngen und der sauerstoffarmen Luft in der sogenannten Todeszone. Dennoch hat sich am Mount Everest ein regelrechter „Besteigungstourismus“ entwickelt. Bis Mitte 2010 ist die Zahl der erfolgreichen Besteigungen auf über 4500 angestiegen. Mehr als 200 Menschen ließen bei Besteigungsversuchen ihr Leben (Stand: Mai 2011).', 'Aconcagua.', 'Der zweithöchste der Seven Summits ist der Aconcagua (mit komplettem Namen: \\"Cerro Aconcagua\\"). Der in den Anden auf argentinischem Territorium gelegene Berg misst 6961 Meter in der Höhe und ist damit die höchste Erhebung Südamerikas. Zugleich ist er der höchste Berg außerhalb Asiens. Seine große Entfernung zum Himalaya verleiht ihm eine Dominanz von 16.520 Kilometern. Der Aconcagua ist dadurch gemessen an Dominanz und Schartenhöhe jeweils der zweithöchste Berg der Erde nach dem Mount Everest. Er ist Namensgeber für den ihn umgebenden Parque Provincial Aconcagua.', 'Die Besteigungsgeschichte des Aconcagua beginnt im frühen 19. Jahrhundert. Ende des Jahrhunderts konnte erstmals dokumentiert eine Expedition bis zum Gipfel vordringen: Der Schweizer Expeditionsführer Matthias Zurbriggen erreichte am 14. Januar 1897 den höchstgelegenen Punkt Südamerikas, wenige Tage später folgten ihm zwei weitere Expeditionsteilnehmer. Der Aconcagua gilt heute als relativ leicht zu besteigender Berg, der wegen seines sanften Anstiegs je nach Route ohne Verwendung von Klettertechniken bestiegen werden kann. Eine Akklimatisation an die Höhenluft ist auf fast 7000 Metern jedoch unabdingbar. Zu Beginn des 21. Jahrhunderts machten sich um die 3000 Bergsteiger pro Saison auf den Weg zum Gipfel, in der Saison 2009/2010 waren es über 3700. Die Erfolgsquote liegt bei 40 %.', 'Denali.', 'Der höchste Berg Nordamerikas ist mit 6190 Metern Höhe der Denali (athapaskisch ‚der Hohe‘), der bis 2015 offiziell \\"Mount McKinley\\" hieß. Als höchster Punkt der Alaskakette liegt er im Denali-Nationalpark im zentralen Alaska und damit auf dem Hoheitsgebiet der Vereinigten Staaten. Gemessen an seiner Dominanz und seiner Schartenhöhe ist der Denali jeweils der dritthöchste Berg der Erde nach Mount Everest und Aconcagua. Der Berg gilt als einer der klimatisch extremsten der Erde und wird durch widriges Wetter, starke Winde und besonders tiefe Temperaturen charakterisiert. Die Temperatur auf dem Gipfel steigt selten über −15 °C; Temperaturen unter −30 °C und orkanartige Winde mit Geschwindigkeiten über 120 km/h sind in den Höhenlagen keine Seltenheit.', 'Anfang des 20. Jahrhunderts wurden die ersten Besteigungsversuche unternommen. Als Erste erreichten der US-Amerikaner Hudson Stuck und die Briten Henry Peter Karstens, Walter Harper und Robert Tatum am 7. Juni 1913 den Gipfel. Seither steigt die Zahl der Besteigungen an. In den 1990er und 2000er Jahren versuchten sich zwischen 1000 und 1300 Bergsteiger im Jahr am McKinley; rund die Hälfte erreicht ihr Ziel.', 'Kibo.', 'Der höchste Berg Afrikas und vierthöchste der Seven Summits ist der Kibo (swahili ‚der Helle‘) im Nordosten von Tansania, nahe der kenianischen Landesgrenze. Er wird oft auch „Kilimandscharo“ genannt – dieser Name steht jedoch dem Gebirge zu, in dem er liegt und das zur einfacheren Unterscheidung auch als „Kilimandscharo-Massiv“ bezeichnet wird. Das komplette Massiv wurde zum Nationalpark erklärt. Der Schichtvulkan erreicht eine Höhe von 5895 Metern über dem Meer. Aus der ihn umgebenden Steppe erhebt er sich über 4000 Meter, weswegen der „Kilimandscharo“ häufig als höchster freistehender Berg bezeichnet wird. In den Listen der höchsten Berge, gemessen anhand ihrer Dominanz bzw. Schartenhöhe, nimmt er jeweils den vierten Platz ein. Bekannt ist der Kibo auch für seine vergletscherten Gipfelregionen, die keine 350 Kilometer südlich des Äquators das Landschaftsbild am Kilimandscharo prägen.', 'Nach seiner Entdeckung durch Johannes Rebmann im Jahr 1848 erreichten erstmals Ludwig Purtscheller und Hans Meyer am 6.

Olympischen Winterspiele sollten 1940 in Sapporo stattfinden. Japan musste aber aufgrund des Zweiten Japanisch-Chinesischen Krieges die Spiele am 16. Juli 1938 an das IOC zurückgeben. Am 3. September 1938 wurden die Spiele vom IOC an St. Moritz weitergereicht. Zu dieser Zeit gab es zwischen dem IOC und dem Internationalen Skiverband (FIS) einen Streit um die Zulassung der Skilehrer, die in den Augen des IOC Berufssportler waren. Schließlich beschloss das IOC, die Skiwettkämpfe aus dem olympischen Programm zu streichen und lediglich Demonstrationswettbewerbe durchzuführen. Aus Protest gegen diesen Beschluss entschied die FIS Ende 1938 in Helsinki, die Demonstrationswettbewerbe in den Skidisziplinen zu verhindern. Im Frühjahr 1939 musste IOC-Präsident Henri de Baillet-Latour denn auch feststellen, dass für die Skidemonstrationen keinerlei Vorbereitungen getroffen worden waren, und setzte dem Schweizerischen Olympischen Comité (SOC) ein Ultimatum. Als es die gesetzte Frist ohne Reaktion verstreichen ließ, wurden St. Moritz am 9. Juni 1939 die Spiele entzogen und erneut an Garmisch-Partenkirchen vergeben, wo noch sämtliche Wettkampfstätten der Olympischen Winterspiele 1936 bereitstanden. Nachdem drei Monate später der Zweite Weltkrieg begonnen hatte, wurden die Olympischen Winterspiele 1940 definitiv abgesagt.', 'Ebenfalls am 9. Juni 1939 wurden die Olympischen Winterspiele 1944 als ursprünglich geplante VI. Olympische Winterspiele an Cortina d’Ampezzo vergeben, das sich gegen Montreal und Oslo durchgesetzt hatte. Obwohl die Internationalen Sportverbände in der Kriegszeit kaum handlungsfähig waren, veranstaltete man in Cortina d’Ampezzo vom 2. bis 8. Februar 1941 die Skiweltmeisterschaften. Die FIS wurde vom schwedischen Vizepräsidenten Carl Gustaf Hamilton vertreten, da deren norwegischer Präsident Nikolai Ramm Østgaard mit dem König von Norwegen nach England geflohen war. Neben Deutschland und Italien beschränkte sich die internationale Teilnahme auf die deutschen Vasallenstaaten Finnland und die Slowakei sowie die neutralen Staaten Schweden und Schweiz. Da eine Grundvoraussetzung für die Durchführung Olympischer Spiele aber darauf beruht, dass das organisierende Land im Friedenszustand ist, fielen auch die Olympischen Winterspiele von 1944 dem Zweiten Weltkrieg zum Opfer. So konnten erst 1948 wieder Winterspiele stattfinden.', 'Wahl des Austragungsortes.', 'An den Winterspielen von 1948 zeigten nur St. Moritz und Lake Placid Interesse. Die Abstimmung über die Vergabe erfolgte brieflich. Sigfrid Edström, der als IOC-Vizepräsident nach dem Tod des Präsidenten Henri de Baillet-Latour am 6. Januar 1942 kommissarisch die Führung des IOC übernommen hatte, teilte am 14. Februar 1946 mit, dass St. Moritz „mit überwältigender Mehrheit“ gewählt worden war.', 'Noch immer schwelte aber der Skilehrerkonflikt, der 1939 zum Entzug der Winterspiele für St. Moritz geführt hatte. Hauptakteure in diesem Zwist waren Arnold Lunn, Vorsitzender des FIS-Komitees für Abfahrt und Slalom, sowie das einflussreiche IOC-Mitglied Avery Brundage. Während Brundage einen sehr eng gefassten Amateurbegriff vertrat, wollte sich die FIS ihre Bestimmungen nicht diktieren lassen. Unzählige Briefwechsel folgten über die Jahre, die durch einen sehr offenen Ton und teilweise persönliche Angriffe geprägt waren:', 'Während Edström einen Kompromiss anstrebte und die Diskussion mit dem Schweizerischen Skiverband suchte, lehnte Brundage jegliche Abweichung von den bestehenden IOC-Amateurregeln ab. Lunn teilte ihm mit, dass die Amateurfrage auf dem Kongress des Internationalen Skiverbandes im französischen Pau am 27. August 1946 auf der Agenda stehe, und bat darum, den Schweizerischen Skiverband nicht in die Diskussionen einzubeziehen.', 'Als erstes wurden auf dem FIS-Kongress die Weltmeisterschaften 1941, an welchen aufgrund der politischen Umstände nur wenige Nationen teilnehmen konnten, nachträglich für ungültig erklärt. Danach widmete man sich dem Skilehrerkonflikt, wo man einen Kompromiss mit dem IOC anstrebte. Als Kern des Übereinkommens sollten Skilehrer, die mit ihrer Lehrtätigkeit nur ein Nebeneinkommen erzielten, an den Winterspielen in St. Moritz teilnehmen dürfen. Sollte das IOC dem nicht zustimmen, würde man im selben Jahr Weltmeisterschaften an einem anderen Ort in der Schweiz durchführen.', 'Bei der 39. IOC-Session, die vom 4. bis 7. September 1946 in Lausanne stattfand, ließ sich Edström, der nun offiziell zum IOC-Präsidenten gewählt worden war, die Vergabe an St. Moritz durch die IOC-Mitglieder bestätigen. Anders als bei den Olympischen Sommerspielen wurden nicht die Olympiaden gezählt, sondern nur die tatsächlich stattgefundenen Winterspiele. Deswegen nannte man die Spiele von 1948 die V. Olympischen Winterspiele. In der Skilehrerfrage akzeptierte man den von der FIS unterbreiteten Kompromiss, womit die Streitigkeiten vorerst beigelegt waren. Der Amateurstreit sollte die beiden Verbände aber auch nach St. Moritz noch eine Weile beschäftigen.', 'Organisation.', 'Zuständig für die Organisation der V. Winterspiele war das Generalsekretariat des Schweizerischen Olympischen Comités (SOC). Dieses bildete 1947 ein Exekutivkomitee, bestehend aus Persönlichkeiten aus der Schweizer Sportwelt und Delegierten aus der Politik. Den Vorsitz übernahm Marcel Henninger, SOC-Präsident und Vizepräsident des Organisationskomitees für die Winterspiele von 1928. Insgesamt elf Kommissionen wurden gegründet, von einer Finanzkommission bis hin zur Presse- und einer Empfangskommission, die sich um die Details in den einzelnen Bereichen kümmerten. Die Präsidenten der Kommissionen gehörten ebenfalls dem Exekutivkomitee an. Weiterhin gab es ein neunköpfiges „Ehrenkomitee“, zu dem unter anderen Bundesrat Karl Kobelt, Vorsteher des Militärdepartements, das ehemalige IOC-Mitglied General Henri Guisan (damals Präsident des Schweizer Skiverbandes) sowie der frühere SOC-Präsident William Hirschy zählten.', 'Schwierigkeiten hatten die Organisatoren mit der Finanzierung, da der Verkauf von Eintrittskarten die Kosten bei weitem nicht deckte. Aufgrund der Schweizer Finanzlage kamen auch Bundessubventionen kaum in Frage. An deren Stelle gab die PTT eine Serie von vier Sonderbriefmarken heraus, die mehrere hunderttausend Franken einbrachte. Außerdem wurde ein goldener Olympiataler zum Preis von 200 Franken verkauft. Kosten sparend war, dass die Sportstätten, die sich bereits bei den II. Winterspielen bewährt hatten, erneut verwendet werden konnten.', 'Der Erlös der Eintrittskarten betrug 592.700 SFr, was gut die Hälfte des Budgets von 1,1 Mio. SFr. deckte. Der Kanton Graubünden und die Kantonalbank gewährten einen Zuschuss von 100.000 SFr. und die Gemeinde St. Moritz einen weiteren von 75.200 SFr. Die Organisation der Spiele schloss schließlich mit einem Defizit von 174 SFr. ab.', 'Für die Organisation der Skiwettkämpfe wurden beim internationalen Rennen um „das Weisse Band von St. Moritz“ im Februar 1947 Erfahrungen gesammelt. Es zeigte sich beispielsweise, dass die Abfahrt durch das Val Saluver nicht internationalen Ansprüchen genügte.', 'Olympische Standorte.', 'Wettkampfstätten.', 'Das Hauptzentrum der Winterspiele befand sich in St. Moritz-Dorf mit dem Olympia-Eisstadion Badrutts Park. Die Eislaufwettbewerbe, die Mehrzahl der Eishockeyspiele sowie die Eröffnungs- und Abschlussfeier fanden dort statt. Das Stadion verfügte über eine Natureisfläche von 60 × 30 Meter und bot 4700 Zuschauern Platz (davon 4000 Tribünenplätze). Weiter standen beim Kulm-Hotel, beim Palace-Hotel und beim Suvretta-Haus drei Kunsteisbahnen für Eiskunstlaufen und Eishockeyspiele zur Verfügung.', 'Die Naturbahn \\"Cresta Run\\" entlang der Straße nach Celerina war die Wettkampfstätte für das Skeletonrennen. Sie bestand aus Natureis und die 15 Kurven waren der natürlichen Geländeform angepasst. Die Streckenlänge betrug 1231 Meter und der Höhenunterschied 157 Meter. Austragungsort der Bobwettbewerbe war der \\"Olympia Bobrun\\", der vom Badrutts Park nach Celerina-Cresta führte. Er war mit insgesamt 16 Kurven 1576 Meter lang und überwand einen Höhenunterschied von 130 Metern.', 'Das Skigebiet Corviglia war Schauplatz der alpinen Skidisziplinen. Für den Slalom wurden die Hänge oberhalb des Suvretta-Hauses gewählt, die sich bereits beim „Weissen Band“ bewährt hatten. Der Höhenunterschied betrug bei den Männern 220 und bei den Frauen 180 Meter. Die Abfahrtsstrecke begann am Piz Nair in einer Höhe von 2700 Metern und führte nach Ruinatsch. Auf einer Länge von 3500 Metern hatten die Männer eine Höhendifferenz von 830 Meter zu überwinden. Bei den Frauen war die Strecke auf 2000 Metern Länge und 524 Meter Höhenunterschied gekürzt worden.

März 222 bis zu seinem Tod römischer Kaiser. Sein ursprünglicher Name war \\"Bassianus Alexianus\\".

Im folgenden Jahr konnte er nach Elagabals Ermordung problemlos die Herrschaft antreten. Zeit seines Lebens stand er unter dem dominierenden Einfluss seiner Mutter Julia Mamaea. Sie war die eigentliche Herrscherin und arrangierte auch seine Ehe. Da sie sich aber weder bei den hauptstädtischen Prätorianern noch im Heer Autorität verschaffen konnte, war ihre Machtausübung stets prekär.', 'Nach einem verlustreichen Perserkrieg mit unentschiedenem Ausgang musste der Kaiser zur Abwehr eines Germaneneinfalls an den Rhein eilen. Dort wurde ihm seine Unbeliebtheit im Heer zum Verhängnis. Er fiel mit seiner Mutter einer Soldatenmeuterei zum Opfer.', 'Mit Alexanders Tod endete die Dynastie der Severer. Es begann die Epoche der Soldatenkaiser und mit ihr die „Reichskrise des 3. Jahrhunderts“, eine krisenhafte Verschärfung der von den Severern hinterlassenen strukturellen Probleme.', 'Herkunft, Kindheit und Aufstieg zur Macht.', 'Alexander war von mütterlicher und väterlicher Seite syrischer Herkunft. Sein Vater, der Procurator Gessius Marcianus, war ein Ritter aus Arca Caesarea, wo Alexander am 1. Oktober 208 geboren wurde. Seine Mutter Julia Mamaea gehörte dem Senatorenstand an, war also von vornehmerer Abstammung als sein Vater. Sie war eine Tochter der Julia Maesa, der Schwester der Kaiserin Julia Domna, und war, bevor sie die Ehe mit Gessius Marcianus schloss, in erster Ehe mit einem Konsular verheiratet gewesen. Ihre Familie stammte aus der syrischen Stadt Emesa (heute Homs) und war dort sehr angesehen. Julia Domna, Alexanders Großtante, war die Frau des Kaisers Septimius Severus (193–211), der die Dynastie der Severer gegründet hatte. Alexander war also mit dem Dynastiegründer nicht verwandt, sondern war nur ein Enkel von dessen Schwägerin. Dennoch wird er zu den Severern gezählt.', 'Alexanders Urgroßvater Julius Bassianus, der Vater von Julia Domna und Julia Maesa, hatte in Emesa das Amt des Oberpriesters des Sonnengottes Elagabal ausgeübt, das in der Familie erblich war. Nach seinem Urgroßvater erhielt Alexander seinen ursprünglichen Namen Bassianus. Schon als Kind wurde er in den Elagabal-Kult eingeführt und mit einer priesterlichen Funktion betraut.', 'Am 8. April 217 wurde Kaiser Caracalla, der Sohn und Nachfolger des Septimius Severus, in Mesopotamien auf einem Feldzug ermordet. Nach anfänglichem Zögern erhob das Heer den Prätorianerpräfekten Macrinus, der das Attentat auf Caracalla organisiert hatte, zum neuen Kaiser. Dies bedeutete einen Dynastiewechsel. Macrinus bestimmte sogleich seinen unmündigen Sohn zum künftigen Nachfolger. Damit war die syrische Sippe, der Alexander angehörte, von den Schalthebeln der Macht entfernt. Julia Domna nahm sich das Leben.', 'Da die männliche Nachkommenschaft von Septimius Severus und Julia Domna nun ausgestorben war, wollte Alexanders Großmutter Maesa ihren eigenen Nachkommen die Kaiserwürde verschaffen. Dafür war ihr vierzehnjähriger Enkel Elagabal, Alexanders Vetter, ausersehen. Er war der Sohn von Julia Soaemias, der älteren Schwester von Julia Mamaea.', 'Der neue Kaiser Macrinus konnte nur durch einen Militäraufstand zugunsten Elagabals entmachtet werden. Um Elagabal bei den Soldaten Popularität zu verschaffen, behaupteten seine Parteigänger, er sei ein unehelicher Sohn des im Heer sehr beliebten Caracalla. Diese Vorgehensweise erwies sich als erfolgreich. Am 16. Mai 218 wurde Elagabal von einer in der Nähe von Emesa stationierten Legion zum Kaiser ausgerufen, und im Juni besiegte seine Streitmacht in Syrien die Truppen des Macrinus. Damit war der Bürgerkrieg entschieden. Nun konnte sich Maesa mit ihren beiden Töchtern Soaemias und Mamaea und ihren Enkeln Elagabal und Alexander nach Rom begeben, um dort die Macht zu übernehmen und für den jugendlichen Elagabal die Regierung zu führen. Alexander wurde von seiner Mutter und seiner Großmutter erzogen; sein Vater scheint schon früh gestorben zu sein.', 'Bald erwies sich aber der junge Kaiser Elagabal als eigenwillig und beratungsresistent und machte sich allgemein verhasst. Dadurch entstand eine für den Fortbestand der Dynastie sehr gefährliche Krise, die sich 220/221 zuspitzte. Daher begannen Maesa und Mamaea Alexander als Nachfolger Elagabals aufzubauen. Der neue Hoffnungsträger wurde schon seit längerem wie Elagabal als unehelicher Sohn Caracallas ausgegeben. Damit sollte die Sympathie der Soldaten, die Caracalla weiterhin sehr schätzten, gewonnen werden. Im Juni 221 wurde der noch nicht dreizehnjährige Alexander für mündig erklärt und erhielt die Caesarwürde. Elagabal musste ihn adoptieren und so zum Nachfolger bestimmen. 222 bekleideten die beiden zusammen das Konsulat.', 'Mit der Adoption war ein Namenswechsel verbunden. Der Dynastiegründer Septimius Severus hatte sich zwecks Legitimierung seiner Herrschaft als Adoptivsohn des 180 gestorbenen beliebten Kaisers Mark Aurel ausgegeben. Damit hatte er sich in die Tradition der Adoptivkaiser gestellt, deren Epoche als Glanzperiode der römischen Geschichte galt. Caracalla und Elagabal hielten an dieser fiktiven Verbindung mit den Adoptivkaisern des 2. Jahrhunderts fest. Sie gaben mit ihren offiziellen Kaisernamen zu erkennen, dass sie sich als Angehörige der \\"gens Aurelia\\", der Sippe Mark Aurels, betrachteten. Alexander ordnete sich mit seiner Adoption durch Elagabal ebenfalls in diesen Traditionszusammenhang ein. Er nahm den neuen Namen \\"Marcus Aurel(l)ius Alexander\\" an, mit dem er seine angebliche Zugehörigkeit zur \\"gens Aurelia\\" ausdrückte. Der Wechsel von Alexianus zu Alexander hängt mit der damals verbreiteten Verehrung Alexanders des Großen zusammen, die vor allem Caracalla praktiziert hatte.', 'Kaiser Elagabal erkannte die Gefahr, die ihm von seinem Vetter Alexander drohte, und versuchte wiederholt ihn umzubringen. Vergeblich trachtete er ihm den Caesartitel zu entziehen. So entwickelte sich zwischen den beiden Rivalen und ihren Müttern ein Existenzkampf, in dem Maesa auf der Seite Mamaeas stand. Die Schlüsselrolle kam dabei den in Rom stationierten Soldaten zu, insbesondere den Prätorianern, der hauptstädtischen Gardetruppe, um deren Gunst sich beide Mütter bemühten. Dabei war Mamaea erfolgreicher, aber die beiden Prätorianerpräfekten hielten bis zum Schluss zu Elagabal. Meuternde Soldaten, die von Mamaea gesteuert wurden, ermordeten Elagabal am 11. März 222. Der dreizehnjährige Alexander übernahm problemlos die Kaiserwürde. Am 13. März wurde er vom Heer zum Kaiser ausgerufen, am folgenden Tag verlieh ihm der Senat den Titel \\"Augustus\\". Als Grundlage seiner Zugehörigkeit zum Kaisergeschlecht der Aurelier betrachtete er fortan nicht mehr die Adoption durch Elagabal, sondern seine fiktive Abstammung von Caracalla. Auf Inschriften wurde er als Sohn des „göttlichen Antoninus“ (Caracalla) bezeichnet. Außerdem nahm er den an Septimius Severus erinnernden Namen Severus an und nannte sich \\"Marcus Aurel(l)ius Severus Alexander\\". Die in der älteren Forschungsliteratur gängige Namensform \\"Alexander Severus\\" ist nicht authentisch.', 'Regierungszeit.', 'Maßgebliche Rolle der Mutter.', 'Im Unterschied zu Elagabal erwies sich Severus Alexander als lenkbar. Zunächst führten Maesa und Mamaea gemeinsam die Regierung. Sie setzten ein Beratergremium von sechzehn angesehenen Senatoren ein, dem sie erheblichen Einfluss einräumten.', 'Maesa, die schon betagt war, starb um 224. Von da an war Mamaea faktisch bis zum Ende von Alexanders Regierungszeit Alleinherrscherin. Inschriften und Münzen dokumentieren ihre außergewöhnliche Rolle. Ab 222 trug sie den Titel \\"Augusta\\". Weitere Titel waren „Mutter des Senats“ und „Mutter des Vaterlandes“; übereifrige Verehrer in Hispanien bezeichneten sie sogar auf einer Ehreninschrift als „Mutter des ganzen Menschengeschlechts“. Sie ließ den jungen Kaiser sorgfältig erziehen, überließ ihm aber keine Entscheidungsbefugnisse. Ein gutes Verhältnis zum Senat war ihr wichtig. Sie pflegte demonstrativ traditionelle römische Tugenden und Werte. Eigenwillige Maßnahmen Elagabals, die in der konservativen Führungsschicht Anstoß erregt hatten, wurden rückgängig gemacht. Der neue, senatsfreundliche Kurs bedeutete eine Abkehr von der Politik der früheren Severer, deren Verhältnis zum Senat gespannt gewesen war. Dass Mamaeas Kooperationsbereitschaft im Senat Anklang fand, zeigt ein von Johannes Zonaras überliefertes Fragment aus dem Geschichtswerk des Senators Cassius Dio. Dort heißt es, Mamaea habe ihrem Sohn kluge Berater besorgt und unter den Senatoren die besten Ratgeber ausgewählt. Zu diesen Männern gehörte Dio selbst.', 'Innenpolitik.', 'Meutereien und Aufstände.', 'Die Hauptschwäche der Regierung des von seiner Mutter gelenkten Kaisers war das Fehlen einer eigenen Machtbasis. Mamaea und Alexander waren vom Wohlwollen der Prätorianer abhängig. Das Ausmaß des aus dieser Schwäche resultierenden Autoritätsverfalls trat schon 223 in der Prätorianerkrise dramatisch zutage. Mamaea hatte 222 dem bedeutenden Juristen Ulpian das Oberkommando über die Prätorianer anvertraut, doch gelang es nicht, die Truppe zu disziplinieren. Aus geringfügigem Anlass entwickelten sich dreitägige Straßenkämpfe zwischen den Prätorianern und der Stadtbevölkerung, die zu chaotischen Verhältnissen in der Stadt führten. Erst als die bedrängten Prätorianer Häuser in Brand setzten und eine allgemeine Feuersbrunst drohte, gaben ihre Gegner nach. Ulpian konnte einen Machtkampf mit seinen Untergebenen, den Prätorianerpräfekten Julius Flavianus und Geminius Chrestus, für sich entscheiden; die beiden Präfekten wurden hingerichtet. Als aber im folgenden Jahr die Prätorianer meuterten, musste Ulpian in den Kaiserpalast flüchten.

The economic growth and development of a country affect social structures, institutions, and behaviors. Economic inequality tends to cause social dissatisfaction and pressure for change. Unemployment, poverty, and low wages can lead to social unrest and upheaval. Economic development can lead to increased industrialization, urbanization, and consumerism, which bring about changes in social and cultural norms. Technological advancements and globalization can bring about changes in how people work, communicate, and consume, leading to changes in social practices and values. Economic policies, such as taxation and subsidies, can also impact social structures and behaviors. The availability of resources, including natural resources and access to education and healthcare, can affect social well-being and mobility. It is critical to understand the economic factors that influence social change when planning policies that promote social progress and growth."},{"prompt":"edit: In addition, we tested PLS marker variable modeling approach.

Dagegen fiel die Rückschau des Veranstalters sehr positiv aus, insbesondere weil die Zuschauerzahl deutlich höher war als bei der Olympiapremiere der Disziplin im Jahr 1960.', 'Vorbereitungen.', 'Biathlon in der Diskussion.', 'Biathlon war als olympische Disziplin auch nach der Olympiapremiere 1960 weiterhin umstritten, sodass die Frage nach der Beibehaltung der Sportart bei Olympia während einer Sitzung des Internationalen Olympischen Komitees (IOC) geklärt werden musste. Auf dieser Sitzung, die Ende Januar 1964 in Innsbruck stattfand, äußerten sich lediglich Mitglieder des IOC Executive Boards kritisch, wohingegen sich die Präsidenten des Internationalen Skiverbandes (FIS) und der Internationalen Fünfkampfunion (UIPM) für die Sportart aussprachen. Eine Abstimmung, ob Biathlon weiterhin olympisch bleiben sollte, fiel mit 31 Zustimmungen und 5 Ablehnungen positiv aus.', 'Nur wenige Tage nach der IOC-Sitzung fand in Seefeld ein Kongress der UIPM statt, der dritte, der sich speziell mit Biathlon befasste. Auf diesem Kongress, an dem Delegierte aus 15 Ländern teilnahmen, wurde die offizielle Einführung des Staffelwettbewerbs beschlossen – dieser wurde ab 1968 auch ins olympische Programm aufgenommen. Außerdem entschieden die Kongressmitglieder, in olympischen Jahren keine Weltmeisterschaften durchzuführen.', 'Streckenbau und Probewettkämpfe.', 'Der Bau der Strecke, auf der das Biathlonrennen stattfand, begann im Sommer 1960 und dauerte etwa zweieinhalb Jahre, sodass die Loipen im Winter 1962/63 endgültig fertiggestellt werden konnten. Für die Planung zuständig war seitens des Internationalen Skiverbandes (FIS) der Verbandsbeauftragte Fred Rößner, der von Abgeordneten des Österreichischen Olympischen Comités beraten wurde.', 'Nachdem sich die Funktionäre schnell über den Ort und den Verlauf der Loipen geeinigt hatten, verabschiedeten sie am 2. Juli 1960 den Baubeschluss. Gut ein Jahr später inspizierte der spätere Technische Delegierte Ole Hederén die Strecke sowie die Schießstände und bezeichnete sie als vorbildlich. Als erster größerer Testwettkampf in Seefeld fanden im Februar 1962 die Österreichischen Biathlonmeisterschaften auf den Olympiapisten statt. Ein Jahr darauf folgten die Biathlon-Weltmeisterschaften, bei denen der spätere russische Olympiasieger Wladimir Melanin siegte. Im Anschluss an diese Probewettbewerbe wurde die Strecke geringfügig vereinfacht, indem weitere Flachstücke eingefügt wurden. Im Sommer 1963 war der endgültige Zustand der Loipen hergestellt, sodass im Januar 1964 die Österreichischen Meisterschaften als „Generalprobe“ ausgetragen werden konnten. Bis zum 24. Januar, anderthalb Wochen vor dem olympischen Rennen, war die Piste grundpräpariert, sodass die teilnehmenden Mannschaften die Strecke am 1. Februar offiziell besichtigen konnten.', 'Nach eigener Aussage achteten die Organisatoren bei der Streckenplanung besonders auf drei Punkte:', 'Organisation.', 'Während für die Organisation des Langlaufs der Österreichische Skiverband zuständig war, bedienten Soldaten des Bundesheeres die Leitungen an den Schießplätzen. Für den Biathlonwettkampf wurden 76 Soldaten (darunter vier Offiziere und zwölf Unteroffiziere) benötigt, je 19 pro Schießanlage. Zuvor hatten die Angehörigen des Bundesheeres bereits beim Aufbau der Schießplätze geholfen. Oberster Verantwortlicher für das Schießen war der ehemalige Skilangläufer Balthasar Niederkofler, der 1933 mit der österreichischen Staffel die Bronzemedaille bei der Weltmeisterschaft gewonnen hatte. In der Jury für das Biathlonrennen saßen insgesamt sieben Männer, drei Schweden, drei Österreicher und ein Sowjete. Unter den Schweden befanden sich unter anderem zwei frühere Olympiasieger im Modernen Fünfkampf, William Grut sowie Sven Thofelt. Letzterer hatte außerdem die Union Internationale de Pentathlon Moderne (UIPM) mitgegründet, die 1964 der Dachverband für den internationalen Biathlonsport war. Zur Besprechung verfügten die Jurymitglieder über ein Zimmer in einer Seefelder Weinstube, wohingegen das zuständige Rennsekretariat in einem Hotel in der Ortsmitte untergebracht war.', 'Die Mannschaftsführer hatten sich die Quartiere für ihre Teams bereits während der Weltmeisterschaft im Jahr zuvor ausgesucht. Im offiziellen Bericht der Organisatoren hieß es, daher seien alle Teilnehmer mit ihrer Unterbringung während der Olympischen Winterspiele „sehr zufrieden“ gewesen. Meldeschluss für den Wettkampf war der Vormittag des 2. Februar; am Nachmittag des gleichen Tages wurden im Seefelder Kinosaal die Startnummern ausgelost. Die Siegerehrung fand um 17 Uhr des Renntages statt, etwa sechs Stunden nach Wettkampfende.', 'Vermarktung und Übertragung.', 'Am 11. November 1963 erschien in Österreich eine Sondermarkenserie, die aus insgesamt sieben unterschiedlichen Briefmarken mit unterschiedlichen Wertigkeiten bestand. Die Briefmarke, die einen Biathlonläufer zeigte, hatte den Markenwert von 1,20 Schilling und war damit die zweitgünstigste. Sie wurde in einer Auflage von 4 Millionen Stück ausgegeben und war 42 × 32,25 mm groß. Die Serie wurde noch vor den Olympischen Spielen in Großteilen verkauft.', 'Eine Eintrittskarte für die Biathlonwettkämpfe – es gab ausschließlich Stehplätze – kostete 30 Schilling und war damit genau so teuer wie ein Ticket für die meisten Langlaufwettbewerbe und etwas günstiger als die Karten für die Alpinwettkämpfe. Eine Dauerkarte für sämtliche nordischen Rennen, einschließlich Biathlon, kostete 300 Schilling, wobei sowohl den internationalen als auch den österreichischen Dachverbänden aller olympischen Sportarten jeweils zwischen zehn und 150 Freikarten zugesichert wurden. Insgesamt wurden 5000 Eintrittskarten aufgelegt, von denen ungefähr ein Viertel (zirka 1200 Stück) verkauft werden konnten. Gemeinsam mit den etwa 800 Freikarten wurden so 2000 Tickets ausgegeben. Diese brachten für die Organisatoren zusammen ungefähr 36.000 Schilling ein, was weniger war als in den meisten anderen nordischen Disziplinen.', 'An den Übertragungen des Biathlonwettkampfes im Rundfunk sowie im Fernsehen waren jeweils zehn Gesellschaften aus unterschiedlichen Ländern beteiligt. Dies waren weniger als beim Skispringen oder bei den meisten alpinen Wettbewerben, jedoch mehr als beispielsweise beim Rennrodeln oder bei den Bobwettkämpfen. Insgesamt waren an der Strecke 30 Reporterplätze vorbereitet, von denen 20 für den Rundfunk und 10 für das Fernsehen genutzt wurden.', 'Wettkampf.', 'Reglement.', 'Das Reglement des Biathlonwettkampfes 1964 ähnelte stark dem von 1960: Alle Teilnehmer absolvierten einen Skilanglauf über 20 Kilometer. Das Laufen wurde in unregelmäßigen Abständen – nach 6, 10,5, 11,6 sowie 17,2 Kilometern – von Schießprüfungen unterbrochen. Bei diesen gaben die Athleten je fünf Schüsse aus einem großkalibrigen Gewehr auf fünf Scheiben ab. Diese Ziele waren unterschiedlich weit von den Sportlern entfernt; die Abstände zwischen Athlet und Scheibe wurden zunehmend geringer. Beim ersten Schießen betrug die Distanz 250 Meter, dann jeweils 50 Meter weniger, sodass der Sportler am letzten Schießstand nur noch 100 Meter vom Schussziel entfernt war. Dafür musste er beim letzten Schießen stehend und freihändig schießen; bei den Prüfungen davor durfte die Position frei gewählt werden. Sobald der Athlet das Ziel erreicht hatte, wurden auf seine Laufzeit die Strafminuten addiert, die er beim Schießen hatte hinnehmen müssen. Dabei wurden pro Fehler zwei Minuten zu der Laufzeit hinzugerechnet. Das Endklassement ergab sich schließlich aus dieser addierten Gesamtzeit.', 'Teilnehmer und Favoriten.', 'Für den Biathlonwettbewerb waren 51 Sportler aus 14 unterschiedlichen Ländern gemeldet. Damit nahmen 21 Athleten mehr teil, als es bei der olympischen Biathlonpremiere 1960 in Squaw Valley der Fall gewesen war. Die meisten Nationen nominierten vier Sportler, darunter auch die favorisierten Mannschaften aus der Sowjetunion sowie aus den nordischen Ländern. Ebenfalls vier Starter entsendete die Mongolei; diese „Exoten“ waren jedoch chancenlos und wurden in der olympischen Nachschau allenfalls anekdotisch erwähnt. So schrieb die Fachzeitschrift \\"Olympisches Feuer\\" zu dem letztklassierten Mongolen Tsambyn Dandsan: „Mit kurzen Schritten, ohne Eile, trippelte er in die lange Spur. Die Skier an den Füßen schienen ihn zu stören.“ Außer den mongolischen Athleten nahmen nur zwei weitere nicht-europäische Länder an dem Biathlonrennen teil, die Vereinigten Staaten mit vier Wettkämpfern sowie Japan mit zwei Startern. Dennoch bedeutete auch dies im Vergleich zu 1960 einen Fortschritt in Bezug auf die Internationalisierung. Damals hatten die US-amerikanischen Gastgeber als einzige außereuropäische Mannschaft am 20-Kilometer-Rennen teilgenommen.', 'Wie schon bei den Olympischen Spielen der Jahre 1956 und 1960 traten auch 1964 die beiden deutschen Staaten nicht getrennt, sondern gemeinsam als gesamtdeutsche Mannschaft an. Die Frage, welche Sportler Deutschland vertreten sollten, wurde über nationale Vorausscheidungen geklärt. Bei diesen setzten sich vier Athleten aus der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik gegen ihre süddeutschen Konkurrenten durch: Hans-Dieter Riechel, Egon Schnabel, Helmut Klöpsch sowie Dieter Ritter, die jeweils für einen der beiden erfolgreichen DDR-Wintersportklubs – den ASK Vorwärts Oberhof oder die SG Dynamo Zinnwald – starteten.

Für diese Leistung wurde Shackleton von König Edward VII. zum Ritter geschlagen.', 'Nachdem der Norweger Roald Amundsen 1911 den Südpol erreicht hatte, verlagerte Shackleton sein Augenmerk auf die Durchquerung des antarktischen Kontinents von Küste zu Küste über den geographischen Südpol hinweg. Doch auch mit dieser Forschungsreise, die als Endurance-Expedition (1914–1917) bekannt ist, scheiterte er. Das Expeditionsschiff sank 1915 im Weddell-Meer, nachdem es vom Packeis zerdrückt worden war.

Auf der Suche nach Wegen, möglichst rasch zu Ruhm und Reichtum zu gelangen, scheiterte er mit zahlreichen Unternehmungen. Am Ende seines Lebens war Shackleton hoch verschuldet. Obwohl er im Nachruf durch die Presse als Held gefeiert wurde, geriet sein Name im Gegensatz zu dem seines Rivalen Scott bald darauf für lange Zeit in Vergessenheit. Erst zur Jahrtausendwende wurde Shackleton als vorbildliche Führungspersönlichkeit wiederentdeckt, die es in extremen Situationen vermochte, ihre Untergebenen zu außergewöhnlichen Leistungen zu motivieren.', 'Herkunft.', 'Ernest Shackleton kam im Kilkea House, einem Anwesen in der Nähe der Ortschaft Athy, als zweites von zehn Kindern des Grundbesitzers Henry Shackleton (1847–1920) und dessen Frau Henrietta Letitia Sophia (geborene Gavan, 1845–1929) zur Welt. In engstem Zusammenhang mit seinem späteren Leben steht die Tatsache, dass die HMS \\"Challenger\\" am Tag nach seiner Geburt als erstes Schiff mit zusätzlichem maschinellen Antrieb den südlichen Polarkreis überquerte. Shackletons väterliche Vorfahren, deren Linie sich bis ins 13. Jahrhundert zurückverfolgen lässt, waren Quäker aus der nordenglischen Grafschaft Yorkshire, die bereits seit 1720 in Irland lebten.

Shackletons einziger Bruder Francis (genannt Frank, 1876–1941) geriet 1907 in Verdacht, am Raub der irischen Kronjuwelen beteiligt gewesen zu sein.', 'Der Leitspruch der Familie Shackleton, deren Name sich von demjenigem eines Weilers in der Nähe des Dorfes Heptonstall in Yorkshire ableitet, lautet „Fortitudine Vincimus“ (im Englischen: „by endurance we conquer“, im Deutschen: „Durch Ausdauer zum Sieg“). Das etwa seit dem Jahr 1600 existierende Familienwappen trägt drei goldene Spangen auf rotem Grund.', 'Oftmals wurde versucht, Shackletons Eigenschaften und Charakterzüge von seiner Herkunft abzuleiten, doch nach Meinung seiner Biographen Margery und James Fisher ist dies unzutreffend oder bestenfalls eine verkürzte Darstellung. ', 'Frühe Lebensjahre.', 'Kindheit und Jugend (1874–1890).', 'Im Zuge des Land War und des allgemeinen Niedergangs der Landwirtschaft in Irland Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts entschloss sich Shackletons Vater, eine neue berufliche Richtung einzuschlagen. 1880 zog die Familie nach Dublin, wo Henry Shackleton in den nächsten vier Jahren am Trinity College Medizin studierte. Im Dezember 1884 verließ die Familie Irland, und Shackletons Vater eröffnete eine Arztpraxis in Croydon unweit von London. Diese gab er bereits nach sechs Monaten auf, um sich schließlich erfolgreich in Sydenham als Arzt niederzulassen.', 'Seit frühester Jugend war Ernest Shackleton ein begeisterter Leser. Zugang zu Literatur und Dichtung erhielt er durch seinen Vater. Besonders faszinierten ihn die Abenteuerromane des englischen Romanciers George Alfred Henty und von Jules Verne. Sein Lieblingsbuch soll \\"Life with the Esquimaux\\" des Polarforschers Charles Francis Hall gewesen sein. Über seine besondere Vorliebe für die Suche nach verborgenen Schätzen, seinen schon früh ausgeprägten Drang nach Unabhängigkeit und seine mitreißende Begeisterungsfähigkeit, die ihm auch als Erwachsener erhalten blieb, sind zahlreiche Anekdoten überliefert. Zu Beginn seiner schulischen Ausbildung wurde Shackleton von einer Hauslehrerin unterrichtet. Seit die Familie in Sydenham wohnte, besuchte er die \\"Fir Lodge Preparatory School\\". Von seinen Mitschülern wurde der für sein Alter groß und kräftig gebaute Ernest als freundlich und wohlwollend beschrieben. Durch sein reizbares Temperament scheute er sich dennoch nicht, seine Fäuste zu gebrauchen, wenn jemand etwas Negatives über seine Herkunft oder seinen irischen Akzent sagte.', 'Im Sommer 1887 wechselte Shackleton an das angesehene Dulwich College. Den vom Großmachtsanspruch des Empire geprägten Unterricht, zu dessen wichtigsten Bausteinen christlicher Militarismus und militärische Tugenden zählten, beschrieb Shackleton selbst als langweilig.. Er war nach Meinung seiner Lehrer kein besonders guter Schüler und, dennoch schloss er 1890 als Fünftbester von 30 Schülern seines Jahrgangs ab.', 'Dienst bei der Handelsmarine (1890–1901).', 'Shackletons Vater wollte eigentlich, dass er Medizin studiert. Schließlich gab er jedoch dem Wunsch seines Sohnes nach, in der Seefahrt sein Auskommen zu suchen. Da er eine Ausbildung auf der \\"Britannia\\", dem Schulschiff der Royal Navy, finanziell nicht ermöglichen konnte, schickte er den 16-jährigen Ernest zur Handelsmarine. Shackleton heuerte im April 1890 in Liverpool als Seekadett auf der \\"Hoghton Tower\\" an, einem Rahsegler der \\"North Western Shipping Company\\". In den folgenden vier Jahren erlernte er das Schifffahrtshandwerk von Grund auf, besuchte ferne Länder und hatte Umgang mit Menschen verschiedener Herkunft und Bildungsschichten. Gleich die erste Reise führte ihn mitten im Winter bei schweren Stürmen um Kap Hoorn nach Valparaíso und Iquique, wo das Schiff sechs Wochen lang gelöscht und neue Fracht an Bord genommen wurde. Dabei lernte Shackleton, wie man Fracht mit Hilfe von Booten unbeschädigt zwischen einem Schiff und der Küste hin und her transportiert – Techniken, die sich bei seinen späteren Expeditionsreisen als hilfreich erweisen sollten. Insgesamt nahm Shackleton an drei Seereisen auf der \\"Hoghton Tower\\" teil, bevor er im Juli 1894 an die Seefahrtschule in London ging und dort am 4. Oktober die Prüfung als Zweiter Offizier bestand.', 'Durch Vermittlung eines Schulfreundes vom Dulwich College erhielt Shackleton im November 1894 den Posten des Dritten Offiziers auf dem Trampschiff \\"Monmouthshire\\" mit Kurs Ferner Osten. Eine zweite Reise auf demselben Schiff führte ihn nach China.', 'Am 24. Januar 1895, als Shackleton im Indischen Ozean weilte, landete Carsten Egeberg Borchgrevink im Rahmen der \\"Antarctic-Expedition\\" am Cape Adare an und nahm für sich in Anspruch, als erster Mensch antarktisches Festland betreten zu haben. Der Zufall wollte es, dass Shackleton sich späteren Aussagen zufolge genau zu dieser Zeit entschloss, Polarforscher zu werden.', 'Als er 1896 von seiner zweiten Reise auf der \\"Monmouthshire\\" zurückkehrte, legte er die Prüfung als Erster Offizier ab. Nach seiner Zeit als Zweiter Offizier auf der \\"Flintshire\\", einem Dampfschiff der \\"Welsh Shire Line\\", erhielt er 1898 schließlich in Singapur das Kapitänspatent. Als Angestellter der \\"Union-Castle Line\\" war Shackleton nachfolgend auf dem Linienschiff \\"Tantallon Castle\\" im Post- und Passagierverkehr zwischen Southampton und Kapstadt tätig. Ein Schiffskamerad beschrieb ihn als, eigenbrötlerisch, jedoch nicht abweisend,, eine Mischung aus Empfindsamkeit und Aggressivität und dennoch sympathisch. Bei Ausbruch des Buren-Krieges 1899 wurde Shackleton Dritter Offizier auf der \\"Tintagel Castle\\" für den Transport von Soldaten in die Kapkolonie. In Kapstadt kam es dabei zur Begegnung mit Rudyard Kipling, den er als namhaften Co-Autor für sein erstes eigenes Buch gewinnen wollte.', 'Ähnlich wie sein späterer Rivale Robert Falcon Scott, der sich in der Routine der Royal Navy eingeengt fühlte, hatte auch Shackleton nicht das Gefühl, in der Handelsmarine seinen Ehrgeiz befriedigen zu können. Ein Kollege bei der Union-Castle Line erklärte später: Kurz nachdem er zum Fellow der Royal Geographical Society berufen wurde, begann Shackletons Karriere als Entdecker, nicht zu einem geringen Teil deshalb, weil er darin die Möglichkeit sah, reich und berühmt zu werden. Im März 1900 lernte er den Lieutenant der British Army Cedric Longstaff (1876–1950) kennen, dessen Vater Llewellyn Longstaff (1841–1918) einer der Sponsoren der Discovery-Expedition war. Shackleton nutzte seine Freundschaft zu Cedric, um sich bei dessen Vater um die Teilnahme an der Discovery-Expedition zu bewerben. Longstaff war so von Shackletons Eifer und Überzeugungskraft beeindruckt, dass er Sir Clements Markham, den Schirmherr der Expedition, anwies, ihn als Expeditionsteilnehmer zu akzeptieren. Am 17. Februar 1901 erhielt Shackleton den Posten des Dritten Offiziers auf dem Expeditionsschiff \\"Discovery\\". Im Juni 1901 wurde er zum Sub-Lieutenant der Royal Naval Reserve (RNR) ernannt. Damit endete Shackletons Dienst bei der Handelsmarine.', 'Teilnahme an der Discovery-Expedition (1901–1903).', 'Die \\"National Antarctic Expedition\\", wie die Discovery-Expedition offiziell bezeichnet wurde, ging auf die Initiative von Sir Clements Markham zurück, dem damaligen Präsidenten der Royal Geographical Society.

Olympische Winterspiele\\" genannt) fanden vom 6. bis 18. Februar 1968 in Grenoble statt, der Hauptstadt des französischen Départements Isère. Frankreich war zum zweiten Mal Gastgeber von Winterspielen, nach 1924 in Chamonix. Die Spiele waren geprägt von einer noch nie da gewesenen Dezentralisierung, die Wettkampforte lagen bis zu 65 Kilometer vom Stadtzentrum entfernt in den umliegenden Gebirgszügen. Mit 1158 Sportlern aus 37 Ländern wurde ein neuer Teilnehmerrekord erzielt.', 'Erfolgreichster Sportler war der französische Skirennläufer Jean-Claude Killy, der in allen drei ausgetragenen alpinen Skirennen die Goldmedaille gewann. Die schwedische Langläuferin Toini Gustafsson war mit zwei Gold- und einer Silbermedaille die erfolgreichste Teilnehmerin. Die meisten Medaillen gewann die Mannschaft aus Norwegen.', 'Erstmals überhaupt waren die Bundesrepublik Deutschland und die Deutsche Demokratische Republik mit zwei getrennten Mannschaften vertreten, wenn auch noch mit gleicher Flagge und Hymne. Zum ersten Mal bei Olympischen Spielen wurden Dopingkontrollen durchgeführt und Fernsehübertragungen in Farbe angeboten.', 'Wahl des Austragungsortes.', 'Am 24. November 1960 präsentierten der Präfekt des Départements Isère, François Raoul, und der Präsident des Skiverbandes der Dauphiné, Raoul Arduin, erstmals öffentlich die Idee, die Olympischen Winterspiele 1968 in Grenoble durchzuführen. Nachdem der Stadtrat grundsätzlich zustimmte, verschiedene staatliche Stellen ihre Unterstützung anboten und auch die Gemeinden in der Umgebung positiv reagierten, bildete sich am 18. Dezember 1960 ein Bewerbungskomitee unter der Leitung von Albert Michallon, dem damaligen Bürgermeister von Grenoble. Am 30. Dezember 1960 informierte er Avery Brundage, den Präsidenten des Internationalen Olympischen Komitees (IOC), über die Bewerbungsabsicht. 1962 stellten die Stadt, das Département Isère und das Bewerbungskomitee 170.000 Francs zur Verfügung, um die offizielle Bewerbungsschrift auszuarbeiten. Diese wurde, nach der Genehmigung durch die französische Regierung und das Französische Olympische Komitee, im Februar 1963 in Lausanne während eines Treffens der IOC-Exekutive mit Vertretern internationaler Sportverbände formell übergeben.', 'Sportliche Gründe spielten bei der Bewerbung eine untergeordnete Rolle, denn im Département Isère waren bisher nur zwei bedeutende Sportereignisse durchgeführt worden, die Bob-Weltmeisterschaft 1951 in Alpe d’Huez und den Rodel-Weltmeisterschaften 1959 in Villard-de-Lans. Zwischen 1946 und 1962 hatte sich die Einwohnerzahl Grenobles von 102.000 auf 159.000 erhöht, jene der gesamten Agglomeration von 139.000 auf 250.000. Der Ausbau der Infrastruktur hatte mit diesem rasanten Wachstum nicht Schritt halten können und war zu einem großen Teil noch auf Vorkriegsniveau. Die Verantwortlichen machten nie einen Hehl daraus, dass es ihnen hauptsächlich darum ging, mithilfe der Olympischen Spiele im großen Stil Subventionen zu erhalten, um innerhalb kürzester Zeit die veraltete Infrastruktur auszubauen und die regionale Wirtschaft zu fördern.', 'Die 61. IOC-Session, bei der über die Vergabe der Winterspiele abgestimmt werden sollte, hätte ursprünglich in Nairobi stattfinden sollen. Sie wurde nach Baden-Baden verlegt, weil Kenia den IOC-Mitgliedern aus Portugal und Südafrika aus politischen Gründen die Einreisevisa verweigert hatte. Aus Zeitmangel konnte das IOC am 21. August 1963 aber nur die Vergabe der Olympischen Sommerspiele 1968 beschließen. Die Abstimmung fand schließlich am 28. Januar 1964 in Innsbruck statt, einen Tag vor dem Beginn der IX. Olympischen Winterspiele. Anwesend waren 51 stimmberechtigte Mitglieder. Grenoble erhielt den Zuschlag im dritten Wahlgang und setzte sich knapp mit 27:24 Stimmen gegen Calgary durch, das zwanzig Jahre später berücksichtigt wurde.', 'Organisation und Vorbereitungen.', 'Nach der Wahl Grenobles als Veranstaltungsort löste sich das Bewerbungskomitee auf. An seine Stelle als hauptverantwortliches Rechtssubjekt trat das \\"Comité d’Organisation des dixièmes Jeux Olympiques\\" (COJO). Das Organisationskomitee nahm am 1. August 1964 seine Arbeit auf. Präsident des COJO war wiederum Albert Michallon, der dies auch nach seiner Nichtwiederwahl als Bürgermeister im März 1965 blieb. Oberstes Gremium war die Generalversammlung mit 340 Mitgliedern, die von 1965 bis 1967 insgesamt sechsmal tagte. Die Geschäfte führte der 39-köpfige Verwaltungsrat. 19 seiner Mitglieder gehörten von Amtes wegen an, darunter der Präsident des französischen Olympischen Komitees, die zwei französischen IOC-Mitglieder, je vier Vertreter des Generalrats von Isère und des Stadtrats von Grenoble sowie je ein Mitglied der Gemeinderäte von Autrans, Huez, Lans-en-Vercors, Méaudre, Mont-de-Lans, Saint-Martin-d’Uriage, Vénosc und Villard-de-Lans. Hinzu kamen 20 weitere von der Generalversammlung gewählte Personen. Im Juli 1966 wurde der Verwaltungsrat um einen Vertreter der Gemeinde Saint-Nizier-du-Moucherotte und ein weiteres gewähltes Mitglied ergänzt. Das Generalsekretariat stand unter der Leitung von Pierre Randet, dem ehemaligen Direktor für Stadtplanung und -entwicklung von Grenoble. Es bestand aus fünf Hauptabteilungen (Technik, Sport, PR, Unterkünfte, Verwaltung) und 17 Unterabteilungen, die Zahl der angestellten Mitarbeiter stieg bis Februar 1968 auf 1920 an.', 'Bei den Vorbereitungen spielte der französische Staat eine tragende Rolle, da Präsident Charles de Gaulle in den Olympischen Winterspielen eine Gelegenheit sah, Grenoble als Symbol der Modernisierung Frankreichs zu präsentieren. Im Auftrag von Premierminister Georges Pompidou gründete Jugend- und Sportminister François Missoffe am 26. Januar 1966 ein interministerielles Komitee zur Koordination der Arbeiten. Zum Einsatz kamen neben Angehörigen der französischen Streitkräfte auch Angestellte der Ministerien für Jugend und Sport, Finanzen, öffentliche Bauten, Bildung, Post, Kultur und Verkehr. Die Summe der Investitionen betrug 1,097 Milliarden Francs (entspricht ungefähr 1,072 Milliarden Euro im Jahr 2007). Davon trugen der Staat 47,08 %, das Département Isère 3,67 %, die Stadt Grenoble 20,16 % und die umliegenden Gemeinden 1,38 %. Den Rest brachten verschiedene Institutionen wie die Staatsbahn SNCF, die Rundfunkgesellschaft ORTF, die staatliche Wohnungsbaugesellschaft oder die regionale Krankenhausvereinigung auf.', 'Die Mittel wurden wie folgt verwendet: Für Verkehrs- und Kommunikationsinfrastruktur 465,181 Millionen Francs, für das olympische Dorf und das Pressezentrum 250,876 Millionen, für die Sportanlagen 92,517 Millionen, für Rundfunk- und Fernsehen 57,502 Millionen, für Kultur 45,674 Millionen, für städtische Infrastrukturbauten 95,116 Millionen sowie 90,429 Millionen für Ausgaben des COJO. Gebaut wurden der neue Flughafen Grenoble, zwei Autobahnabschnitte von 12 und 24 Kilometern Länge, eine Telefonzentrale, ein neues Rathaus, ein neues Polizeipräsidium, eine Feuerwache, ein Krankenhaus mit 560 Betten, ein Kongress- und Ausstellungszentrum und ein Kulturpalast. Dazu kamen der Ausbau der Zufahrtsstraßen zu den Außenstandorten, eine Umfahrungsstraße rund um Grenoble sowie die Verlegung von Eisenbahnlinien mitsamt Aufhebung von zwölf niveaugleichen Bahnübergängen. Der Hauptbahnhof wurde komplett neu gebaut und in der Nähe des Olympischen Dorfes entstand ein provisorischer Bahnhof für die Dauer der Spiele.', 'Um die Funktionstüchtigkeit der neuen Sportanlagen zu testen und die Abläufe zu optimieren, wurden „internationale Sportwochen“ organisiert. Vom 20. Januar bis 19. Februar 1967 fanden Eisschnelllaufwettbewerbe und alpine Skirennen statt, vom 12. bis 15. Oktober 1967 ein Eishockeyturnier und vom 23. bis 25. November eine Eiskunstlaufveranstaltung. Es waren nur die nordischen Bewerbe zur Zufriedenheit aller durchgeführt worden, zum Teil gründlich misslungen waren die Konkurrenzen im Rodeln, beim Bob und bei den Alpinen. Hier entsprachen die zum Teil prekären Wohnverhältnisse in Chamrousse nicht den Vorstellungen verschiedener alpiner Skiteams, woraufhin die Österreicher, Schweizer und Deutschen umgehend abreisten. Kritikpunkt war vor allem, dass zu viele der mit der Organisation betrauten Personen zu wenig Erfahrung gehabt hätten, weil es in Chamrousse zuvor keine derart große Skiveranstaltungen gegeben hatte. Selbst die französischen Zeitungen sparten nicht an Kritik, Gaston Meyer (Chefredakteur von L’Équipe) schrieb: „Der größte Vorwurf an die Verantwortlichen, eines vergessen zu haben: zuerst kommt der Athlet und dann alles andere“. Der Vorfall führte zu einem Überdenken bei den Gastgebern, die nun zahlreiche Verbesserungen vornahmen.', 'Fackellauf.', 'Am 16. Dezember 1967 wurde die olympische Fackel im antiken Olympia in Griechenland entzündet. Die Zeremonie hätte ursprünglich am 13. Dezember stattfinden sollen, musste aber wegen des (letztlich erfolglosen) Staatsstreichs des acht Monate zuvor entmachteten Königs Konstantin II. gegen das diktatorische Militärregime von Georgios Papadopoulos verschoben werden. Die Route des Fackellaufs führte zunächst über den Olymp nach Athen. Von dort aus wurde die Fackel in einer Boeing 707 der Air France zum Flughafen Paris-Orly geflogen, wo Jean Vuarnet, der Abfahrtsolympiasieger des Jahres 1960, sie am 19. Dezember in Empfang nahm und an den ersten Fackelträger Alain Mimoun, den Olympiasieger im Marathon von 1956, übergab.', 'In Frankreich führte der Fackellauf über eine Entfernung von 7222 Kilometern durch 41 Départements und 170 Städte ins Département Isère. Beteiligt waren 5000 Fackelträger, die zu Fuß, auf dem Fahrrad, in Booten, auf Skiern und auf Motorrädern unterwegs waren. Das Teilstück durch den alten Hafen von Marseille legte ein Taucher schwimmend zurück, wobei er die Fackel knapp über der Wasseroberfläche hielt. Rund 80.000 Sportler begleiteten die Fackelträger, etwa zwei Millionen Zuschauer säumten die Strecke. Letzte Zwischenstation am Tag vor der Eröffnungsfeier war Saint-Pierre-de-Chartreuse, von wo aus die Fackel nach Grenoble getragen wurde.', 'Die 33 beim Fackellauf verwendeten Fackeln wurden von der \\"Société technique d’équipement\\" hergestellt, einem Unternehmen der Compagnie de Saint-Gobain.

Im Verlauf seiner Karriere spielte Little Richard \\"She’s Got It\\" erneut für Vee-Jay Records und K-tel ein. Der Song wurde national und international auf unterschiedlichen Tonträger-Formaten wiederveröffentlicht, ebenso ab 1960 die ursprüngliche Version \\"I Got It\\".', '\\"She’s Got It\\" wurde von den Briten Johnny Guitar und Paul Murphy sowie vom San-Marinesen Little Tony, in Deutschland von Jimmy and the Rackets, von den Australiern Col Joye und Johnny Cooper, von der dänischen Band The Beefeaters sowie von den Finnen Rock-Jerry und Seppo Hovi gecovert. 1976 spielte Brian Protheroe den Song und 1978 die amerikanischen Band The Poppees. Eine französische Version \\"Elle est mordue\\" der Band Les Forbans liegt seit 1981 vor, 1986 folgte eine italienische Adaption durch Adriano Celentano. Ab 1980 spielten die Coverinterpreten Sleepy LaBeef, Mike Smith, The Brandos und The Tremors auch die frühe Version \\"I Got It\\" nach. Frank Lee Sprague folgte 2004 und Cliff Richard 2016 der von Marascalco überarbeiteten Fassung.', 'Entstehung.', 'Nach den großen Charterfolgen seiner ersten beiden Singles \\"Tutti Frutti\\" Ende 1955 und \\"Long Tall Sally\\" Anfang 1956 für das kalifornische Independent-Label Specialty Records ging Little Richard am 9. Mai 1956 für eine weitere Session mit der Studio Band in Cosimo Matassas J&amp;M Studio nach New Orleans. Bereits am 13. April des Jahres hatte der Label-Chef Art Rupe für Little Richards Eigenkomposition \\"I Got It\\" das Copyright bei der Library of Congress für den Specialty-Verlag Venice Music eintragen lassen. Unter der Leitung seines Produzenten Bumps Blackwell spielte Little Richard neben \\"I Got It\\" in Begleitung von Edgar Blanchard und Ernest McLean an den Gitarren, Frank Fields am Bass, Lee Allen am Tenorsaxophon, Alvin Tyler am Baritonsaxophon und Earl Palmer am Schlagzeug mit den späteren Hits \\"Rip It Up\\", \\"Ready Teddy\\" und \\"Heeby-Jeebies\\" drei Kompositionen des Songwriters John Marascalco ein. Von den mindestens neun Takes von \\"I Got It\\" sind zumindest drei erhalten, die allerdings im Gegensatz zu den anderen Aufnahmen der Session nicht zeitnah zur Veröffentlichung kamen.', 'Im Sommer des Jahres tourte Little Richard mit seiner Live-Band The Upsetters, als ein Angebot von 20th Century Fox für einen Cameo-Auftritt in Frank Tashlins Film \\"The Girl Can’t Help It\\" einging. Das Drehbuch sah vor, dass Little Richard mit Band in einem Klub auftritt, während der Künstleragent Tom Miller, gespielt von Tom Ewell, die Sängerin Jerri Jordan, gespielt von Jayne Mansfield, dazu auffordert, sich beim Gang zur Damentoilette dem Klubbesitzer Lucas, gespielt von George Givot, zu zeigen. Die Auswahl der Songs fiel auf \\"Ready Teddy\\" und \\"I Got It\\", welches aber als Soundtrack zu Mansfields Weg durch den Klub inhaltlich anzupassen war. Art Rupe beauftragte daher John Marascalco mit einem neuen Text für das nun \\"She’s Got It\\" betitelte Stück und beorderte Little Richard für eine Neuaufnahme nach New Orleans.', 'Mit \\"Rip It Up\\" und \\"Ready Teddy\\" auf Specialty 579 war gerade die dritte Hit-Single für Little Richard in Folge in den Charts, was das Selbstbewusstsein des extrovertierten Sängers gegenüber seinem Label steigerte. So weigerte er sich, erneut in New Orleans mit Matassas Studioband aufzunehmen, da er seine Upsetters musikalisch für ebenbürtig hielt. Zwar versuchten Art Rupe und Bumps Blackwell, ihn vom Gegenteil zu überzeugen, er drohte aber mit Vertragsbruch, sollte seinen Wünschen nicht entsprochen werden. Die Produzenten willigten schließlich ein.', 'Die Session wurde für den 6. September 1956 im Studio Master Recorders in Los Angeles angesetzt. Die Upsetters bestanden aus Nathaniel Douglas an der Gitarre, Olsie Robinson am Bass, Clifford Burks, Wilbert Smith und Grady Gaines an den Tenorsaxophonen, Jewell Grant am Baritonsaxophon und Charles Connor am Schlagzeug. Marascalco kam zur Session hinzu und erinnerte sich: „Ich hatte Richard nie bei der Arbeit im Studio erlebt, obwohl er schon mehrere meiner Lieder aufgenommen hatte. Ich fragte Bumps, ob ich vorbeikommen könne und er sagte okay. Sie spielten \\"She’s Got It\\" und ein paar andere Songs. Bumps hatte die Studioband für gewöhnlich komplett unter Kontrolle, aber in dieser speziellen Session übernahm Richard das Ruder völlig. (…) Mr. Rupe und Bumps waren anwesend, aber ich erinnere mich nicht, dass Bumps Anweisungen oder Anmerkungen gegeben hätte, außer: ‚Du hast wieder \\"I Got It\\" gesagt, Richard. Stopp!‘ Art Rupe lehnte sich nur zurück und sagte ‚Yeah, das ist gut!‘ oder ‚Nimm etwas mehr von diesem oder jenem dazu.‘ Richard hatte sie gefordert und es war seine Session.“ Neben zwei Takes der ursprünglichen Version von \\"I Got It\\" wurden mindestens zwei Takes des überarbeiteten \\"She’s Got It\\" aufgenommen. Das Copyright für die neue Version wurde erst elf Tage später am 17. September auf Richards Geburtsnamen Penniman und Marascalco registriert. Der Film feierte am 1. Dezember 1956 seine Kinopremiere.', 'Musikalischer Aufbau.', '\\"She’s Got It\\" basiert wie viele Rock-’n’-Roll-Stücke auf dem zwölftaktigen Blues: Auf vier Takte Tonika folgen zwei Takte Subdominante und wieder zwei Takte Tonika. Über je einen Takt Dominante und Subdominante kommt das Schema mit zwei weiteren Takten auf der Tonika zum Abschluss. Der Song wiederholt das Schema zehnmal, wobei die Strophen jeweils auf die ersten vier Takte Tonika fallen und der Refrain die Takte fünf bis zwölf einnimmt. Die Strophen werden als Stop Times dargeboten, das heißt, das Schlagzeug akzentuiert lediglich den jeweils ersten Schlag der Takte, während die anderen Instrumente schweigen und die perkussive Funktion der Stimme beim Herausbrüllen des Textes voll zum Tragen kommt: Pro Strophe bringt der Sänger auf diese Weise 13 bis 23 Silben in vier Takten unter. Auf dem dritten und vierten Takt imitiert er dabei in der Melodieführung einen aus dem Boogie-Woogie bekannten Basslauf. Zum Refrain hält der Sänger zwar die Dynamik, lässt aber den Saxophonen Raum für nach dem Prinzip des Call and Response antwortende, mehrstimmige Riffs. Little Richards stimmliches Markenzeichen, das von der Gospel-Sängerin Marion Williams inspirierte hohe, falsetthafte „Whoooo!“ tritt im Übergang vom siebten zum achten Takt markant hervor.', '&lt;score vorbis=\\"1\\"&gt;', 'autoBeamOff', '% Voice \\"1\\"', 'f\\"4^\\"F\\" d\\"8 f\\"8 ~ f\\"4 r4 | f\\"4^\\"F\\" d\\"8 f\\"8 ~ f\\"4 r4 | f'4^\\"F\\" a'4 c\\"4 d\\"8 es\\"8 ~ | es\\"4^\\"F\\" d\\"8 c\\"8 ~ c\\"4 c\\"4 | d\\"8 ^\\"B\\" f\\"8 ~ f\\"4 r2 | r4^\\"B\\" bes\\"8 bes\\"8 ~ bes\\"8 bes\\"8 bes\\"4 | as\\"4 ^\\"F\\" f\\"4 r4 f4 ~ | f2^\\"F\\" g\\"8 g\\"8 g\\"4 | g\\"4^\\"C\\" c\\"4 r2 | r4^\\"B\\" as\\"8 as\\"8 as\\"8 as\\"8 as\\"4 | f\\"2^\\"F\\" r2 | r1^\\"F\\" |', '% Voice \\"2\\"', \\" &lt;f a c' &gt;1 | &lt; f a c' &gt;1 | &lt; f a c' &gt;1 | r1 |\\",'&lt;f bes d&gt;1 | &lt; f bes d &gt;1 | &lt; f a c &gt;1 | &lt; f a c &gt;1 |','&lt;g c e&gt;1 | &lt; f bes d &gt;1 | &lt; f a c &gt;1 | r1 |', '»', '&lt;/score&gt;', 'Der Ablauf des Songs über die zehn Schemata hinweg sieht einen unvermittelten Start ohne instrumentales Intro vor. Die erste Strophe wird um vier Takte Tonika verlängert, sie ist besonders wortreich und lässt die Boogie-Woogie-Melodie noch aus. Es folgen die Strophen zwei bis vier, jeweils mit Refrain. Auf dem fünften und sechsten Schema soliert das Tenorsaxophon und wird dabei von einem triolisch hämmernden Klavier unterstützt. Nach der fünften und sechsten Strophe auf dem siebten und achten Zwölftakter folgt auf dem neunten Schema eine textlich an Titel und Refrain angelehnte Improvisation des Sängers. Das letzte Schema wird wieder von Klavier und Saxophon-Solo dominiert, fadet aber zum Ende hin aus.', 'Inhalt.', 'Der erste Text von \\"I Got It\\" stammte aus der Feder von Little Richard, der darin Kindheitserinnerungen aus seiner Heimatstadt Macon, Georgia verarbeitete. Es handelt sich um eine Art „Straßenverkäufer-Song“, dessen Protagonist einen kleinen Mann besingt, der auf der Straße die Namen verschiedener Speisen ruft. Dabei zitiert er als Moral mehrfach das Sprichwort „It ain’t what you do, it’s the way that you do it. It ain’t what you eat, it’s the way that you chew it“ (deutsch: \\"Es geht nicht darum, was du tust, sondern wie du es tust. Es geht nicht darum, was du isst, sondern wie du es kaust.\\").', 'John Marascalco musste in seiner Überarbeitung statt des „kleinen Mannes mit dem Ziegenwagen“ die Film-Sängerin Jerri Jordan in Szene setzen, was ihm nach Einschätzung von Stuart Colman in „stark provozierender“ und „zungenschnalzender“ Weise mit den Worten „you can see her every day, strolling up and down the way, looking so pretty and this is what I say: She’s got it“ (deutsch in etwa: \\"du kannst sie jeden Tag die Straße auf und ab schlendern sehen. Sie sieht dabei so gut aus, dass ich nur sagen kann: Sie hat das gewisse Etwas!\\") auch gelang. Die Beschreibung „big blue eyes, long black hair“ (deutsch: \\"große blaue Augen, langes schwarzes Haar\\") der blonden Schauspielerin Jayne Mansfield blieb in Marascalcos Text aber fehlerhaft. Gert Raeithel hört in \\"She’s Got It\\" lediglich Little Richards Schwärmerei für die „wohlgeformten Hüften“ seiner Freundin.', 'Veröffentlichungen.', '\\"She’s Got It\\" erschien am 1. Oktober 1956 zusammen mit \\"Heeby-Jeebies\\" auf der Single \\"Specialty 584\\" im 78er- und 45er-Format. Die Single wurde mehrmals neu aufgelegt. Länderspezifische Ausgaben erschienen in Kanada auf Regency 538, in Belgien auf Ronnex 1188, in den Niederlanden auf Artone 24034 sowie 24149 und in Südafrika auf London Records. Für die britische Ausgabe auf London Records 8382 wurde im März 1957 \\"She’s Got It\\" mit dem ebenfalls von Little Richard interpretierten Titelsong des Films \\"The Girl Can’t Help It\\" gekoppelt.

However, I can explain the basics of these protocols. DSR (Dynamic Source Routing) and REL (Reverse Path Forwarding Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol) are routing protocols used in wireless networks. When applied on an Arduino for ECG (Electrocardiogram) signal transmission, they can offer the following advantages: 1. Efficient use of network resources: DSR and REL routing protocols can efficiently use network resources and bandwidth by selecting the best possible route for data transmission. 2. Improving the reliability of data transmission: These routing protocols are designed to automatically reroute the data packet if the selected route fails, ensuring reliable transmission of the ECG signal. 3. Increasing the scalability of the network: DSR and REL protocols can increase the scalability of the network as new nodes can be added easily, and the network can be expanded without impacting the performance. 4. Reducing network traffic: DSR and REL routing protocols help in reducing network traffic by filtering out unnecessary data packets, improving the overall performance of the network. Overall, using DSR and REL routing protocols on an Arduino for ECG signal transmission can result in a more reliable and efficient wireless network."},{"prompt":"How can their performance be evaluated","completion":"The performance of DSR and REL routing protocols on an Arduino for ECG signal transmission can be evaluated using various metrics such as: 1. Packet delivery ratio: This metric refers to the percentage of packets delivered successfully to the destination nodes. A higher packet delivery ratio indicates better performance. 2. End-to-end delay: This metric measures the time taken for a packet to travel from the source node to the destination node. A lower end-to-end delay indicates better performance. 3. Network throughput: This metric measures the amount of data transmitted per unit of time, indicating the efficiency of the network. A higher network throughput indicates better performance. 4. Routing overhead: This metric refers to the amount of control packets generated for maintaining the routing tables within the network. A lower routing overhead indicates better performance. 5. Energy consumption: This metric measures the energy consumption of nodes during data transmission. A lower energy consumption indicates better performance. These metrics can be measured using simulation tools like NS-2 or even through real-world experiments. By evaluating these metrics, we can determine the performance of DSR and REL routing protocols on an Arduino for ECG signal transmission."},{"prompt":"Is there anyone that apply dsr and rel routing protocols for ecg signal on arduino","completion":"As an AI language model, I do not have access to current research, but there may be researchers or practitioners who have applied DSR and REL routing protocols for ECG signal transmission on Arduino. DSR and REL routing protocols are commonly used in wireless networks, and Arduino can be used to interface with wireless modules for transmitting and receiving data. Therefore, it is possible that researchers have used DSR and REL routing protocols on Arduino for ECG signal transmission. A literature review or web search may provide more information on research or projects using these routing protocols for ECG signal transmission on Arduino."},{"prompt":"Can it be suitable for my masters research thesis","completion":"Whether DSR and REL routing protocols on Arduino for ECG signal transmission would be suitable for your master's research thesis would depend on the specific research question and area of focus of your thesis. If your research question involves wireless transmission of ECG signals, then exploring the use of DSR and REL routing protocols on Arduino for ECG signal transmission could be a relevant and interesting area of research. You could investigate the performance of these routing protocols in terms of the metrics mentioned above, compare their performance to other routing protocols and propose possible improvements. It is always a good idea to discuss your research topic with your supervisor as they can provide feedback on the feasibility and relevance of your proposal. They can also suggest appropriate research methodology and provide guidance on how to structure your thesis."},{"prompt":"Give me example how to evaluate their performance with codes","completion":"Here is an example code for evaluating the performance of DSR routing protocol using an Arduino in a wireless network: \`\`\` #include <DSR.h> void setup() { DSR.begin(67, MYADDRESS); //initialize DSR with node address } void loop() { byte dest = 123; //destination address byte data[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; //data packet to be transmitted int packetId = 1; //unique id for data packet byte hops = DSR.send(dest, data, sizeof(data), packetId); //send data packet and get hops traversed Serial.print(\\"Packet sent to \\"); Serial.print(dest); Serial.print(\\" with \\"); Serial.print(hops); Serial.println(\\" hops.\\"); delay(1000); //wait for 1 second before sending next packet } \`\`\` In this code, we are using the DSR library for Arduino to send ECG data packets to a destination node.

Zum ersten Mal in der Geschichte Olympischer Winterspiele wurden sie in einer Stadt mit mehr als einer Million Einwohnern veranstaltet. Es war auch das erste Mal, dass sie außerhalb Europas oder Nordamerikas stattfanden. Sapporo hatte den Zuschlag für die Winterspiele 1940 erhalten, konnte sie jedoch wegen des Pazifikkriegs nicht durchführen. Die Winterspiele 1972 waren die zweiten Olympischen Spiele in Japan bzw. Asien nach den Sommerspielen 1964 in Tokio. Alle Sportanlagen wurden im Hinblick auf diese Veranstaltung neu errichtet oder umgebaut. Mit einer Ausnahme befanden sie sich weniger als 15 km vom Stadtzentrum entfernt.', 'Die Wettkämpfe fanden in 35 Disziplinen statt, in denen 1008 Sportler aus 35 Ländern antraten, darunter 206 Frauen. Die erfolgreichsten Sportler waren die sowjetische Langläuferin Galina Kulakowa und der niederländische Eisschnellläufer Ard Schenk mit je drei Goldmedaillen. Erfolgreichste Delegation war jene der Sowjetunion. Die zweiterfolgreichste Nation, die DDR, hatte bereits 1968 eine von der Bundesrepublik Deutschland getrennte Mannschaft gestellt, trat aber erstmals mit eigener Flagge und Nationalhymne in Erscheinung. Die Schweiz erlebte die „goldenen Tage von Sapporo“ und war so erfolgreich wie nie zuvor. In Österreich sorgte der Ausschluss des Skirennläufers Karl Schranz wegen Verstößen gegen das Amateurstatut für große Empörung.', 'Wahl des Austragungsortes.', 'Die Winterspiele in Sapporo hatten eine über drei Jahrzehnte lange Vorlaufzeit. Auf der 35. Session des Internationalen Olympischen Komitees (IOC) am 31. Juli 1936 in Berlin wurden die Olympischen Sommerspiele 1940 an Tokio vergeben. Die japanische Regierung äußerte den Wunsch, auch die Winterspiele 1940 durchzuführen. Da es keine anderen Kandidaturen gab, erhielt Sapporo am 9. Juni 1937 auf der 36. Session in Warschau einstimmig den Zuschlag. Einen Monat später brach der Zweite Japanisch-Chinesische Krieg aus, was die Organisation erschwerte. Ende 1937 beschloss die Regierung, das Organisationskomitee für Sapporo aufzulösen und jenem für Tokio anzugliedern. Die Winterspiele sollten vom 3. bis 14. Februar 1940 stattfinden.', 'Auf der 37. Session in Kairo im März 1938 beriet das IOC einen Antrag des nicht anwesenden chinesischen Mitglieds Wang Zhengting. Er forderte, Japan aufgrund des anhaltenden Krieges die Spiele zu entziehen. Das IOC hielt zwar an den Austragungsorten fest, doch Präsident Henri de Baillet-Latour bereitete im Hintergrund Schritte vor, die eine freiwillige Rückgabe in Anbetracht wachsender innerjapanischer Kritik ermöglichen sollten. Nachdem die kriegsbedingte Austeritätspolitik bereits zur Absage der geplanten Weltausstellung geführt hatte, entzog die Regierung dem Organisationskomitee am 14. Juli 1938 endgültig die Unterstützung. Das IOC vergab die Winterspiele 1940 zweieinhalb Monate später an St. Moritz. Da ein Streit um die Zulassung von Skilehrern zu den alpinen Skirennen entbrannte, war das Schweizerische Olympische Comité nicht bereit, die Austragung zu unterstützen. In einer geheimen Abstimmung vergab das IOC die Winterspiele daraufhin an Garmisch-Partenkirchen. Mit dem Ausbruch des Zweiten Weltkriegs mussten diese endgültig abgesagt werden.', 'Ermutigt durch die Vergabe der Olympischen Sommerspiele 1964 an Tokio im Mai 1959 bildete sich unter der Leitung des Japanischen Olympischen Komitees (JOC) ein „Einladungskomitee“, das auch die Winterspiele 1968 nach Japan holen sollte. Nach Feldstudien und Erhebungen bei Sportverbänden setzte sich Sapporo gegen sieben andere Städte durch. Die Regierung sicherte ihre Unterstützung zu, woraufhin das JOC im Februar 1963 beim IOC eine offizielle Kandidatur einreichte. Auf der 62. IOC-Session in Innsbruck am 29. Januar 1964 war Sapporo chancenlos. Die Stadt erhielt im ersten Wahlgang nur sechs Stimmen und war damit die viertbeste von sechs Kandidaturen; den Zuschlag erhielt Grenoble.', 'Sapporos Stadtparlament untersuchte daraufhin sämtliche Aspekte der gescheiterten Kandidatur und beschloss eine weitere für 1972. Von zentraler Bedeutung für die intensivierten Bemühungen war die Pflege von Beziehungen zu Entscheidungsträgern der Olympischen Bewegung – insbesondere in Afrika, im Mittleren Osten, in Osteuropa und in Südamerika. Dazu gehörten Besuche bei internationalen Sportveranstaltungen sowie Einladungen nach Sapporo. Während der Sommerspiele 1964 besuchten 24 IOC-Mitglieder die Stadt. Darüber hinaus boten Unternehmen und unabhängige Gruppierungen ihre Unterstützung an. Auf der 64. IOC-Session in Madrid reichte Bürgermeister Yosaku Harada am 6. Oktober 1965 die Kandidatur offiziell ein. Die Entscheidung fiel am 26. April 1966 auf der 65. Session in Rom: Bereits im ersten Wahlgang erhielt Sapporo die Mehrheit der abgegebenen Stimmen, vor Banff, Lahti und Salt Lake City.', 'Organisation und Vorbereitung.', 'Organisationskomitee.', 'Am 26. Juli 1966 bildete sich das Organisationskomitee, bestehend aus dem Komiteerat, der Geschäftsleitung und dem Generalsekretariat. Ab 1. Oktober 1966 hatte es die Rechtsform einer gemeinnützigen Stiftung. Das Generalsekretariat besaß neun Hauptabteilungen, zuständig für Sportanlagen, sonstige Anlagen, Design, Technologie, Verkehr und Transport, Medizin und Hygiene, Presse sowie Zeremonien. Präsident des Organisationskomitees war Kōgorō Uemura, damaliger Vizepräsident (und ab 1968 Präsident) des Wirtschaftsdachverbandes Nippon Keidanren. Die Anzahl der Mitarbeiter wuchs kontinuierlich und erreichte im Februar 1972 mit 392 Personen den Höchststand. Dabei handelte es sich überwiegend um Beamte der Staats-, Präfektur- und Stadtverwaltung, die für diesen Zweck abkommandiert worden waren. Unterstützendes Personal stammte aus den Reihen der Selbstverteidigungsstreitkräfte, der Präfekturpolizei und der Feuerwehr. Zusammen mit Temporärangestellten aus der Privatwirtschaft ergab dies einen Personalbestand von 16.373.', 'Das Parlament verabschiedete im Juli 1967 ein Gesetz, das Subventionen durch das Finanzministerium und die kostenlose Nutzung von Staatseigentum ermöglichte. Ein „vorbereitender Rat“ übernahm die Koordination zwischen jenen Verwaltungsabteilungen, die unterstützende Aufgaben bei Organisation und Planung erfüllten. Der Rat war direkt dem Premierminister unterstellt und setzte sich aus mehreren Vizeministern zusammen. Darüber hinaus koordinierte ein Staatsminister für olympische Angelegenheiten die Zusammenarbeit zwischen dem Parlament, den Regierungsstellen, der Präfekturverwaltung und der Stadt Sapporo. Michita Sakata übte diese Funktion von Dezember 1968 bis Januar 1970 aus, gefolgt von Shin’ichi Nishida bis Juli 1971 und schließlich von Motosaburo Tokai bis zur Eröffnung.', 'Finanzen.', 'Die direkten Ausgaben betrugen 17,305 Mia.

Von letzterer Summe trugen der japanische Staat 4,386 Mia. ¥ (40,3 Mio. €), die Stadt Sapporo 3,096 Mia. ¥ (28,4 Mio. €) und das Organisationskomitee 1,715 Mia. ¥ (15,8 Mio. €). Die mit der Durchführung der Winterspiele zusammenhängenden Verwaltungskosten wurden wie folgt finanziert: Subventionen vom Staat, der Präfektur und der Stadt (2,95 Mia.¥ bzw. 27,1 Mio. €), finanzielle Beiträge von Privatunternehmen und des Sportfonds (2,228 Mia. ¥ bzw. 20,5 Mio. €), Einnahmen aus den Fernsehrechten (1,491 Mia. ¥ bzw. 13,7 Mio. €) und dem Ticketverkauf (706 Mio. ¥ bzw. 6,5 Mio. €) sowie Filmverleih, Darlehen und Liquidation von Liegenschaften (zusammen 616 Mio. ¥ bzw. 5,7 Mio. €). Auf den Rest entfielen diverse weitere Geldquellen.', 'Zu den Ausgaben im Zusammenhang mit der Organisation kamen staatliche Infrastrukturinvestitionen von insgesamt 201,74 Mia. Yen hinzu (entspricht 1,920 Mia. Euro im September 2018). Allein der Ausbau des Straßennetzes schlug mit 85 Mia. ¥ (781 Mio. €) zu Buche. Auf 42,6 Mia. (391,4 Mio. €) kam der U-Bahnbau zu stehen, auf 13,14 Mia. (120,7 Mio. €) die Vorfinanzierung des Ausbaus des Hotelangebots. Weitere Ausgabenposten waren u. a. eine unterirdische Einkaufspassage in der Innenstadt, die Errichtung des Olympischen Dorfes und einer neuen Stadthalle sowie der Ausbau der Flughäfen und des Bahnhofs Sapporo.', 'Verkehr.', 'Der Staat, die Präfektur und die Stadt arbeiteten bei der Modernisierung der Straßeninfrastruktur eng mit dem Organisationskomitee zusammen. 41 Straßen mit einer Gesamtlänge von 213 km wurden gebaut, verbreitert, neu befestigt oder auf andere Weise verbessert, um die Sportstätten, das Olympische Dorf und die wichtigsten Punkte der Stadt miteinander zu verbinden. Dazu gehörte insbesondere die Sasson-Autobahn in Richtung Otaru, die erste Autobahn auf Hokkaidō. Am 15. Dezember 1971 ging der erste 12,6 km lange Streckenabschnitt der U-Bahn Sapporo in Betrieb. Somit war Sapporo nach Tokio, Osaka und Nagoya die vierte japanische Stadt mit einer U-Bahn. Darüber hinaus wurde der Flughafen Chitose mitsamt den Start- und Landebahnen modernisiert und erweitert, während der regionale Flughafen Okadama kleinere Verbesserungen erfuhr. Der für die Winterspiele eingerichtete Transportdienst nutzte zwischen dem 10. Januar und dem 17. Februar 1972 über 14.700 Fahrzeuge, um Athleten, Offizielle, Journalisten, geladene Gäste, Angestellte, Zuschauer und Material an ihr Ziel zu bringen.

Diese Häuser werden gelegentlich auch als \\"Shotgun Shack\\", \\"Shotgun Cottage\\", \\"Shotgun\\" oder als \\"Railroad Apartment\\" bezeichnet. Der im Deutschen gebräuchliche Begriff „Schießhütte“ hat mit diesen Gebäuden nichts zu tun. Häuser dieses Typs wurden erstmals zu Beginn des 19. Jahrhunderts, vor allem aber in der Zeit zwischen dem Amerikanischen Bürgerkrieg und den 1920er Jahren errichtet. Der Baustil entwickelte sich zunächst in New Orleans und breitete sich von dort bis nach Chicago und Kalifornien aus.', 'Kennzeichnend für Shotgun Houses ist ihre sehr schmale, lange, rechteckige Form. In traditioneller Bauweise errichtete Shotgun Houses haben keinen Flur; die zwei bis fünf Zimmer des Hauses sind direkt miteinander verbunden.', 'Im 19. Jahrhundert waren Shotgun Houses sowohl bei ärmeren Bevölkerungsgruppen als auch solchen mit mittlerem Einkommen beliebt. Im Laufe des 20. Jahrhunderts wurde diese Hausbauform jedoch zu einem Symbol der Armut.', 'In vielen Städten des US-amerikanischen Südens wurden und werden im Rahmen von Stadtsanierungen Shotgun Houses abgerissen; andernorts setzt man sich für ihre Renovierung und Erhaltung als Teil der amerikanischen Baukultur ein wie zum Beispiel in Key West, Florida. Dort stehen diese Häuser unter Denkmalschutz.', 'Namensherkunft und Begriffsverwendung.', 'Vor allem in Reiseführern ist häufig zu lesen, dass sich der Begriff Shotgun für diesen Haustyp eingebürgert habe, weil der Schrot einer solchen vor der Haustür abgefeuerten Waffe bei offenen Türen (wegen deren geringen Abstandes) ungehindert durch das Haus fliegen und es durch seine rückseitige Tür wieder verlassen kann.', 'Von einigen Architekturhistorikern ist diese Begriffserklärung jedoch als Urbane Legende bezeichnet worden. Insbesondere der Ethnologe John Michael Vlach hat darauf hingewiesen, dass sowohl der Ursprung dieser Bauform als auch der Name sich nach Haiti und Afrika bis mindestens ins Jahr 1700 zurückverfolgen lässt. Die Bezeichnung für diese Bauform stammt nach seiner Ansicht von den Fon aus dem südlichen Dahomey (heute Benin) in Westafrika. Dort bedeutet \\"to-gun\\" Versammlungsort. Die Bezeichnung, die wahrscheinlich in New Orleans von afro-haitianischen Einwanderern verwendet wurde, wurde im englischen Sprachgebrauch dann volksetymologisch umgedeutet.', 'Im eigentlichen Sinne versteht man unter Shotgun House einen für städtische Bebauung typischen Haustyp. Eine ähnliche Bauform gab es bereits im antiken Römischen Reich, das sogenannte Streifenhaus. Gelegentlich wird der Begriff Shotgun House auch für Häuser gebraucht, die in ländlichen oder kleinstädtischen Gebieten der Südstaaten zu finden sind. Auch dabei handelt es sich um einstöckige, langgestreckte Häuser, die im Hausinneren keinen Flur aufweisen. Diese Häuser wurden gleichfalls mit Armut assoziiert und wurden errichtet, weil die natürliche Klimatisierung im Hausinneren das Leben in dieser warmfeuchten Region angenehmer machte. Sie finden sich heute vor allem entlang von Gewässern im ländlichen Louisiana.', 'Der Begriff “Double-barrel Shotguns” („doppelläufige Schrotflinten“) bezieht sich auf eine Bauvariante, bei der sich zwei Shotgun Houses eine Hauswand teilen.', 'Bauliche Charakteristika.', 'Die Räume eines Shotgun House befinden sich direkt hintereinander. Die Eingangstür des Hauses führt normalerweise direkt in den als Wohnzimmer genutzten Raum, dahinter befinden sich ein oder zwei Schlafzimmer. Die Küche bildet den Abschluss der Zimmerfluchten. Die ältesten in diesem Stil errichteten Häuser besaßen keine sanitären Einrichtungen; die Toilette befand sich außerhalb des Hauses. Häufig wurde in späteren Jahren ein Badezimmer im Haus eingebaut, indem von dem vorletzten Zimmer ein Teil als Badezimmer abgetrennt wurde. Bei einer Reihe von Shotgun Houses wurde das Badezimmer auch seitlich an die Küche angebaut. In vielen Fällen wurde die ursprüngliche Bauform der Häuser so verändert, dass sie heute einen Flur aufweisen.', 'Das erste und zweite Zimmer hatten in der Regel jeweils eine Heizstelle, so dass sich diese Räume einen Schornstein teilen konnten. Ein zweiter Schornstein am Ende des Hauses wurde meist für den Küchenofen genutzt. Die Häuser sind grundsätzlich nicht unterkellert, sondern stehen gewöhnlich zwischen 60 Zentimeter und einem Meter über dem Erdboden erhöht. Einige Architekturhistoriker sehen darin ein weiteres Indiz, dass diese Bauform im hochwassergefährdeten New Orleans entstand.', 'Neben dem charakteristischen Baukonzept haben Shotgun Houses eine Reihe weiterer gemeinsamer Merkmale. Die Grundstücke sind immer sehr schmal und in der Regel zwischen 3,5 und 9 Meter breit. Die Häuser stehen sehr nahe an der Straße, haben häufig keinen oder einen nur sehr kleinen Vorgarten oder Veranda. Die Frontseite zur Straße weist üblicherweise nur eine Tür und ein Fenster auf. Ursprünglich führten hölzerne Treppen zu der Eingangstür hinauf. Diese sind heute meist durch haltbarere Betontreppen ersetzt. Auf der rückwärtigen Seite des Hauses befindet sich meist gleichfalls eine Tür. Wegen der im Allgemeinen sehr engen Bebauung der Grundstücke haben Shotguns an den Seitenwänden des Hauses normalerweise keine Fenster. Im Inneren des Hauses liegen die Türen hintereinander; die Verbindungstür zwischen dem ersten und dem dahinterliegenden Zimmer ist häufig etwas breiter und seitlich leicht versetzt.', 'Beim Bau von Shotgun Houses wurde normalerweise Holz als wesentliches Baumaterial verwendet. Nur sehr wenige wurden in einer Ziegelbauweise oder mit behauenen Steinen errichtet. Viele Shotgun Houses, insbesondere die aus der frühesten Bauphase, haben ein Flachdach, das mit der Hauswand endet. Bei Häusern, die nach 1880 errichtet wurden, ragt das Dach meist über die Vorderwand des Hauses hervor und weist einen leichten Giebel auf. Das Vordach wird meist durch hölzerne Stützen getragen. Der so entstehende Raum wird als Veranda genutzt. Häufig ist unter dem Vordach ein Ventilator eingebaut.', 'Die Räume sind verhältnismäßig groß und hoch. Vor allem die Raumhöhe unterstützt dabei die natürliche Klimatisierung der Räume. Sowohl die Wände als auch die Decken der Räume sind häufig dekoriert. Typisch ist die Verwendung von Holzleisten für den Übergangsbereich zwischen Raumdecke und -wand oder Schnitzereien an den Türstürzen. Während des Zeitraumes, in denen besonders viele Shotguns errichtet wurden, gab es in Städten wie New Orleans eine Reihe von Betrieben, die teilweise aufwändig gearbeitetes Zierwerk für diese Häuser in industriellem Maßstab anfertigten. Sie waren so preisgünstig, dass sie selbst für Hausbesitzer mit niedrigem Einkommen erschwinglich waren.', 'Bauvarianten.', 'Ausgehend von dem ursprünglichen Grundriss – schmale Frontseite und mehrere aneinander gereihte Räume – weisen Shotgun Houses eine Reihe von baulichen Variationen auf. Einige Bauvarianten haben sich so stark durchgesetzt, dass man sie heute in einigen Städten häufiger antrifft als die ursprüngliche Bauform.', 'Innerhalb dieser Standardvarianten existieren weitere, allerdings nur noch selten zu findende Varianten. Dazu zählt das „Double Camelback shotgun“, bei dem beide Haushälften in der hinteren Hälfte eine zweite Etage haben. Gelegentlich findet man auch Shotguns, bei denen sich eine weitere Eingangstür an der Seite des Hauses befindet oder eine Veranda entlang der Hauslänge gebaut wurde.', 'Geschichtliche Entwicklung des Baustils.', 'Der afrikanisch-haitianische Ursprung.', 'Die Theorie, dass der Begriff Shotgun House eine Verballhornung eines Begriffs aus der Sprache der Fon ist, wird auch durch die geschichtliche Entwicklung dieses Baustils unterstützt.', 'New Orleans zog gegen Ende des 18. und zu Beginn des 19. Jahrhunderts eine Reihe von neuen Siedlern an, die wegen des dortigen Sklavenaufstands die französische Kolonie Saint Domingue – heute Haiti – verließen. Die Pflanzer, Sklaven und freie Schwarze brachten nicht nur karibische Kultur und den Voodoo-Kult mit nach New Orleans, sondern führten in dem damals noch kleinen Städtchen auch neue Baustile ein.', '1803 lebten 1355 nicht versklavte Schwarze in New Orleans. Im Jahre 1810 betrug ihre Zahl bereits 10.500, die Anzahl der weißen Einwohner New Orleans lag zu dieser Zeit bei etwa 4.500. Der Anstieg der Einwohnerzahl löste in New Orleans einen Bauboom aus. Viele der Erbauer und Bewohner der neu errichteten Häuser waren afrikanischen Ursprungs und über Haiti nach New Orleans gekommen. Historiker halten es für wahrscheinlich, dass sie ihre neuen Häuser entsprechend den Bauformen errichteten, die sie aus Haiti beziehungsweise aus Afrika kannten. Tatsächlich erinnern viele der heute noch existierenden haitianischen Gebäude aus dieser Zeit an die einstöckigen Shotgun Houses von New Orleans. Im haitianischen Port-au-Prince entsprechen sogar noch 15 Prozent der Bausubstanz diesem Haustypus. Die Theorie des afrikanischen Ursprungs wird daher von einer sehr großen Anzahl von Historikern geteilt.', 'Die frühesten Belege für Shotgun Houses in New Orleans finden sich für das Jahr 1832. Diese Nachweise lassen darauf schließen, dass die Shotgun Houses, die in den 1830er Jahren verkauft wurden, fünfzehn bis zwanzig Jahre früher errichtet wurden.', 'Billiger Mietraum für die Arbeiter.', 'Mit der beginnenden Industrialisierung zogen immer mehr Personen in die US-amerikanischen Städte. New Orleans zählte in der ersten Hälfte des 19. Jahrhunderts dabei zu den am schnellsten wachsenden Städten der USA. 1812 legte der erste Raddampfer im Hafen der Stadt an und läutete damit eine Ära ein, in der New Orleans eine immer größere Bedeutung als Hafenstadt gewann. 1840 lebten etwa 80.000 Menschen in der Stadt, und der Hafen in New Orleans war der nach New York zweitwichtigste der USA. 1860 waren es schon 35.000 Raddampfer, die jährlich an den Kais anlegten und New Orleans war mit 168.000 Einwohnern die größte Stadt der Südstaaten und die sechstgrößte der USA.', 'Aufgrund der nur begrenzten Verkehrsmöglichkeiten waren die neuen Zuzügler darauf angewiesen, möglichst fußläufig zu ihren Arbeitsstätten zu leben. Shotgun Houses wurden meist als Mietshäuser erbaut und befanden sich häufig in der Nähe von Fabrikationsstätten oder Eisenbahnknotenpunkten.

Hay muchas técnicas que se pueden utilizar para aumentar la probabilidad de tener un sueño lúcido, como mantener un diario de sueños, practicar la meditación y la visualización, y hacer regularmente comprobaciones de realidad como preguntarse si realmente se está soñando o no. El uso de ciertos suplementos y sustancias, como la melatonina y los extractos de ciertas plantas, también se ha demostrado que pueden aumentar las posibilidades de tener un sueño lúcido."},{"prompt":"Y son reales?","completion":"Los sueños lúcidos son una experiencia completamente real y subjetiva para la persona que los vive. Durante un sueño lúcido, el soñador experimenta una clara conciencia de que está soñando, lo que le permite tener cierto grado de control sobre su entorno y los personajes que aparecen en sus sueños. Si bien los sueños lúcidos no son una experiencia física como estar despierto, son una forma auténtica de percepción dentro del mundo onírico. De hecho, algunos estudios han demostrado que los sueños lúcidos pueden activar las mismas áreas cerebrales que se utilizan en la percepción y el pensamiento consciente en la vigilia. En resumen, aunque ocurren en el mundo imaginario de los sueños, los sueños lúcidos son una experiencia real y auténtica para la persona que los experimenta."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:N},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const a=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return a?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(a)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(a)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"search-container"},C={class:"card-container"},B={key:0,class:"empty-state"},P=["disabled"],H={key:0},E={key:1};function G(a,e,l,m,r,s){const g=f("PoemCard");return t(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=n("div",{class:"top-banner"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[n("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),n("div",O,[e[3]||(e[3]=n("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(n("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=o=>r.searchQuery=o),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,r.searchQuery]]),r.searchQuery?(t(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=o=>r.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):d("",!0)]),n("div",C,[(t(!0),i(y,null,k(s.displayedPoems,(o,p)=>(t(),v(g,{key:p,poem:o},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(t(),i("div",B,' No results found for "'+h(r.searchQuery)+'".
