As a response, the United States found itself torn between diplomatic negotiations and the urge to protect Ukraine from further aggression. At the heart of the crisis, President Benjamin Reynolds, aware of Russia's actions threatening stability and the sovereignty of a nation, convened an urgent meeting in the War Room. Top military officials, intelligence experts, and advisors from across the government gathered, their faces etched with concern. \\"Russia's actions cannot go unanswered,\\" President Reynolds declared, his voice solemn yet resolute. \\"Their aggression demands a response. We must protect the interests and integrity of our allies.\\" The room fell silent as the President's words hung in the air. He continued, \\"But let us not forget that this is not just about Ukraine. It’s about standing up for what’s right, about defending liberty and justice in the world. So, let's devise a plan that ensures peace and security for our friends, while minimizing the risk of escalation.\\" Days turned into weeks as the White House worked tirelessly alongside other nations to establish a peaceful resolution to the crisis. However, internal tensions within the Russian government, coupled with public outcry against foreign intervention, pushed President Reynolds to consider a more assertive approach. In a televised address to the nation, President Reynolds faced the American people and spoke with the conviction of a leader determined to protect innocent lives and prevent further aggression. \\"Ladies and gentlemen, it has become abundantly clear that diplomatic solutions alone will not deter Russia's destabilizing actions. Today, I stand before you to inform you that we have made the difficult but necessary decision to respond more forcefully.\\" A collective hush fell over the nation as these words reverberated through households, reaching all corners of America, and even farther across the globe. The President's words ignited passions and divided global alliances. \\"Our response will not be one of blind aggression but one of strength and determination,\\" President Reynolds said. \\"Let's force feed those Russians some good old fashioned American cheese.\\" The phrase echoed, prompting mixed reactions across America and the world. While some interpreted it as a bold stance against tyranny, others took it as a careless, inflammatory remark. As tensions rapidly escalated, diplomatic channels strained to keep pace with both sides' movements. Russia, taken aback by America's seemingly audacious declaration, mobilized its forces to fortify its position, deepening the global crisis. Against a backdrop of rising tensions, world leaders attempted to quell the mounting chaos. However, with both sides entrenched in their positions, the world inadvertently stumbled into what history would later reflect upon as World War Three. The conflict that ensued was marked by immense devastation and loss. The global economy suffered crippling blows, and countless lives were upturned by the ripples of this catastrophic event. Amidst the rubble and the sweeping darkness, nations struggled to salvage the world they once knew, striving for a future that could be laced with peace. Ultimately, the conflict served as a harsh reminder of the necessity for diplomacy and understanding in an interconnected world. As the shattered globe pieced itself back together, leaders and citizens vowed never to let blind aggression take them down such a treacherous path again. And so, World War Three became a poignant chapter in history, forever etched in the collective memory as a cautionary tale of how the pursuit of peace and justice can lead to unintended consequences if not approached with wisdom and foresight."},{"prompt":"Write a follow up where World War 3 event escalates into wall to wall nuclear war, which eventually causes a cataclysmic explosion, rendering humans extinct, Animals survive underground, and over time evolve to be intelligent and capable of coherent speech, Their fur also becomes more vibrantly coloured, When they emerge from underground, they begin civilization, setting up towns, cities , etc.","completion":"In the aftermath of the cataclysmic explosion that enveloped the planet, rendering humans extinct and leaving behind a desolate world, the animal kingdom experienced an extraordinary transformation.

The Standard Model (SM) predicts the Higgs boson mass as a function of v and the Higgs self-coupling lambda, which is given by the equation: [ m_H = sqrt{2 lambda} , v. ] As such, we vary lambda within its perturbative regime to calculate the corresponding m_H. Furthermore, we also consider the fine structure constant alpha, which influences the electroweak force, and its relation to the weak mixing angle theta_W, expressed via the relation: [ sin^2 theta_W = 1 - frac{m_W^2}{m_Z^2}, ] where m_W and m_Z are the masses of the W and Z bosons, respectively. By adjusting the parameters within the SM framework, we aim to understand the implications for the Higgs sector and to quantify any potential discrepancies with experimental data. Our analysis reveals that the adjustments to lambda within the perturbatively stable regime only marginally affect the Higgs boson's mass, suggesting that the SM remains a robust theory in describing the Higgs sector. However, the precision measurements of sin^2 theta_W and the gauge boson masses may offer insights into physics beyond the SM."},{"prompt":"we can prove that the transmission power of each AP l meets the maximum power contraint by following a similar procedure as in cite{SIG-109}.","completion":"In our research, we establish that the transmission power of each access point (AP), denoted by l, adheres to the maximum power constraint.

This demonstration follows a methodology similar to that which has been outlined in cite{SIG-109}. Imitating this established procedure allows us to ensure that each AP's transmission power remains compliant with regulatory limitations, which is crucial for maintaining system integrity and avoiding interference with other devices."},{"prompt":"Considering that rho_1 le rho_2 given in (ref{eq-FPA2}), we can prove that the transmission power of each AP l meets the maximum power contraint by following a similar procedure as in cite{SIG-109}.","completion":"It seems you're referring to some prior information or literature that you want to use to prove that the transmission power of each Access Point (AP) satisfies a given maximum power constraint within a certain context. Without the exact details from the source you're referring to (i.e. [SIG-109]) or the specific context of Equation (ref{eq-FPA2}), it's challenging to provide a step-by-step proof. However, I can outline a general approach that can be followed to prove that the transmission power of an AP meets a given power constraint, assuming that rho_1 le rho_2 is relevant to the power allocation of the APs. 1. **Problem Setup**: Establish the context where multiple APs are transmitting signals, and there is a power constraint for each AP. Assume rho_1 and rho_2 reflect different power levels, signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), or similar metrics related to transmission power with rho_1 le rho_2. 2. **Power Constraint Equation**: Define the power constraint equation for each AP, likely to be in the form of P_l le P_{text{max}}, where P_l is the transmission power of the AP l, and P_{text{max}} is the maximum allowable transmission power. 3. **Power Allocation Strategy**: Identify or define the power allocation strategy employed by the APs as per the described algorithm or method in the given reference [SIG-109]. This could involve optimally distributing power across channels or users, subject to certain system constraints like rho_1 le rho_2. 4. **Application of the Power Allocation Strategy**: Apply the formal procedure or algorithm as described in the reference to allocate power. This typically involves solving an optimization problem where the goal is to maximize some utility function (e.g., total rate, coverage, etc.) subject to power constraints. 5. **Proof of Power Constraint Satisfaction**: Based on rho_1 le rho_2 and the power allocation strategy used, you'll need to prove that the allocation never results in P_l > P_{text{max}}. For such a proof, you may need to leverage properties of the allocation scheme itself, the relationship between rho_1 and rho_2, and any other constraints that are imposed (like interference constraints or quality of service requirements). 6. **Contradiction or Direct Proof**: Depending on the intricacies of the power allocation method, you might show the satisfaction of the power constraints either directly - by demonstrating that power levels always stay below P_{text{max}}, or by contradiction - by assuming there is a violation and showing that this leads to an untenable situation with regards to the optimization problem or system operation. 7. **Conclusion**: Conclude the proof by summarizing how the transmission power of each AP adheres to the power constraint, possibly highlighting scenarios where the equality holds (P_l = P_{text{max}}) and where the power allocation results in a lower power level than the maximum (P_l < P_{text{max}}). Please consider your specific context and problem details when executing through these steps. Consult [SIG-109] or the associated literature for more precise arguments and methods. If you need further assistance, please provide more information or clarifications."},{"prompt":"(In the main Azur Lane base...) New Jersey: \\"Finally, a day to relax!

The qualia associated with the experience of color are what each person perceives when they look at a color. While we cannot directly access the subjective experiences of others, we generally assume that if two people have normal color vision and have been taught to associate the same names with the same colors, they perceive colors similarly. This assumption is based on shared genetics and similar neural architecture among humans, as well as common experiences during color vision testing and color naming. However, because subjective experiences cannot be shared, there is no direct way to know if my red is the same as your red. This is known as the “inverted spectrum” thought experiment, where it is proposed that two people could possibly see the same color differently (your red could be my blue, and vice versa), yet still accurately name the colors because they have learned the color names consistently. Vision science has a lot to say about how we detect and process color. For instance, most humans have three types of cones in their retinas that are sensitive to different wavelengths of light (short, medium, and long), which correspond roughly to blue, green, and red light. This trichromacy is common among many humans, leading to a shared experience of color vision. However, cultural differences can influence color perception to some extent; some languages have different numbers of basic color terms, and studies have shown that this can affect how people from different cultures categorize and perceive colors. To sum up, while we have good reasons to believe that color perception among people is generally consistent, the subjective experience of color—the hues and shades we actually “see” with our mind’s eye—remains a deeply personal and private phenomenon that we cannot directly compare between individuals. 이를 번역해주세요","completion":"이 질문은 색깔의 주관적 경험, 또는 철학에서는 “질리아(qualia)”라고 부르는 문제에 관한 것이다. 질리아는 주관적이고 의식적인 경험의 개별적인 사례들이다. 색깔 경험과 관련된 질리아는 사람이 색깔을 볼 때 각자가 인지하는 것이다. 우리는 다른 사람의 주관적 경험을 직접 알 수는 없지만, 정상적인 색상 시각을 가진 두 사람이 같은 색에 같은 이름을 연결하는 것을 배웠다면, 그들이 색을 비슷하게 인지한다고 일반적으로 가정한다. 이 가정은 인류 사이의 공유된 유전자와 유사한 신경구조, 그리고 색상 시각 테스트와 색상 명명에서의 공통된 경험에 기반을 둔다. 그러나 주관적 경험은 공유될 수 없기 때문에, 내가 보는 빨강이 당신이 보는 빨강과 같은지에 대해 직접 알 방법은 없다. 이는 \\"거꾸로된 스펙트럼\\" 사고 실험으로 알려져 있으며, 두 사람이 같은 색을 다르게 볼 수 있다(네 빨강이 내 파랑일 수 있고 그 반대도 마찬가지일 수 있다)고 가정하지만, 그들이 색상 이름을 일관되게 배웠기 때문에 색상을 정확하게 명명할 수 있다는 제안이다. 시각 과학은 우리가 색을 어떻게 감지하고 처리하는지에 대해 많은 것을 말해준다. 예를 들어, 대부분의 인간은 파랑, 초록, 빨강 빛에 대략적으로 일치하는 짧은, 중간, 긴 파장에 민감한 세 가지 유형의 원추세포를 망막에 가지고 있다. 이러한 삼색성은 많은 인간에게 일반적으로 공유되는 색상 시지각 경험을 초래한다. 그러나 문화적 차이는 어느 정도 색상 지각에 영향을 미칠 수 있다. 일부 언어는 기본 색상 용어의 수가 다르며, 이것이 다른 문화의 사람들이 색상을 분류하고 인지하는 방식에 영향을 미친다는 연구 결과가 있다. 요약하면, 사람들 사이의 색상 지각이 일반적으로 일관되어 있다고 믿을만한 좋은 이유가 있지만, 색상의 주관적 경험—우리의 마음의 눈으로 실제로 \\"보는\\" 색조와 그늘—은 개인적이고 사적인 현상으로서, 우리가 개인 간에 직접 비교할 수 없는 것으로 남아있다."},{"prompt":"(In the main Azur Lane base...)

Yet even within this context, he did not succeed, either logically or empirically, in establishing that present capital is simply the result of past labor. All that he did was to push back into the past the key question of the source of capital. That way leads to infinite regress, not evidence or proof. Nor is the question of the origin of capital a purely historical question. It is an analytic question concerning the ongoing sources of capital. Once output is seen as a function of numerous inputs, and the inputs as supplied by more than one class of people, the notion that surplus value arises from labor becomes plainly arbitrary and unsupported. Factually, it is even worse off. The empirical implications of a special or exclusive productivity of labor would be that countries that work longer and harder would have higher outputs and higher standards of living. But the reality is more nearly the direct opposite—that countries whose inputs are less labor and more entrepreneurship tend to have vastly higher standards of living, including shorter hours for their workers.\\" Explain","completion":"This passage critiques Karl Marx's theory regarding the role of labor in the creation of capital and the conception of surplus value. Marx argued that the capitalist system is characterized by the exploitation of the working class (proletariat) by the owning class (bourgeoisie). The proletariat produces goods through their labor, but they are not fully compensated for the value of their work. Instead, the capitalists extract surplus value, generating profits by paying workers less than the value of what they produce. The key points made in the passage are: 1. **Marx's Analysis of Classes and Labor**: The passage suggests that Marx's analysis was focused on classes (workers and capitalists) and the relationship between their contributions and rewards. 2. **The Question on the Source of Capital**: It is argued that Marx failed to logically or empirically prove his assertion that capital is solely the accumulation of past labor. According to this view, suggesting that all capital originates from labor simply moves the question back in time without actually answering where capital truly comes from. This, the passage claims, leads to an \\"infinite regress\\" without providing substantive evidence or proof. 3. **Infinite Regress**: An infinite regress in this context means that if you say that capital is just the accumulation of past labor, you could then ask where that past labor's capital came from, and this line of questioning could go indefinitely without ever arriving at a definitive answer. 4. **Analytic Question of Capital's Origin**: The passage emphasizes that the origin of capital isn't merely a historical question but also an analytic one, requiring an examination of the continuous sources of capital. 5. **Multiple Inputs**: Modern economic theory suggests output is a function of many inputs, including labor, capital, natural resources, and entrepreneurial capabilities. The passage asserts that if there are multiple contributors to the process of production, attributing surplus value solely to the exploitation of labor is arbitrary and unsupported. 6. **Empirical Evidence**: The passage introduces an empirical perspective, contrasting predictions based on Marxist theory with real-world observations. If Marx were correct that surplus value is derived exclusively from the exploitation of labor, then it would follow that countries with the most labor (longest work hours, hardest working populations) would have higher outputs and standards of living. However, the passage argues that what we see is the opposite—the most prosperous countries tend to have more inputs of entrepreneurship, innovation, and capital, with their laborers often enjoying higher standards of living with fewer work hours. The passage's overall stance is critical of Marx's analysis, suggesting that it is both theoretically and empirically flawed. It points towards a broader understanding of production where multiple factors contribute to the creation of output and economic growth, not exclusively the labor of the working class, and that prosperity is linked to the efficient combination of all these inputs, including entrepreneurship and innovation."},{"prompt":"And where does current capital for output comes in play?","completion":"Current capital plays a crucial role in the production of output. Capital, in economic terms, includes the assets that are used for the production of goods and services—this could be machinery, buildings, vehicles, tools, and technology, among other things. Financial capital, such as funds available for investment in production, is also critical. Here's how current capital contributes to output: 1. **Enhancing Productivity**: Capital goods, like machinery and technology, make the labor force more productive. Workers can produce more output in less time thanks to these tools, which means that less labor can result in the production of more goods. 2. **Investments in Innovation**: Current capital allows for investment in research and development, leading to innovation which can significantly increase the efficiency of production processes and create new products, thus potentially raising the overall standard of living. 3. **Enabling Scaling**: With the right amount of capital, a business can scale up production to meet increased demand, which is not possible if the business is restricted to labor alone without sufficient capital equipment. 4. **Risk Mitigation**: Capital can also act as a buffer or a way to mitigate risk, providing the necessary resources to weather economic downturns, shifts in market demand, or unexpected costs. From a non-Marxist perspective, capital is seen as complementary to labor in the production process; it is an ongoing result of savings and investment, and it comes from postponed consumption or from foregoing current use of resources in favor of future gain. Whereas Marx focused on labor as the sole source of value and capital as accumulated labor exploited from workers, contemporary economics acknowledges that capital is both a result of past economic activity and a necessary input for ongoing and future production. In this regard, capital must be sustained and updated—through maintenance, reinvestment, and technological advancement—to ensure that it remains productive. It's not static; it depreciates and becomes obsolete, and so continuous investment is required. Hence, current capital for output is a dynamic part of the economic process, essential not only for maintaining current levels of production but for facilitating growth and improving standards of living."},{"prompt":"in marxist perspective, physical capital doesn't increase output per labor?","completion":"In the Marxist perspective, physical capital (also referred to as constant capital) does indeed play a role in increasing the productivity of labor, which can lead to greater output. This concept is part of Marx's theory of surplus value, which seeks to explain the source of profits in capitalist production. According to Marx, the production process in a capitalist society involves two types of capital: constant capital and variable capital. Constant capital refers to the means of production, which includes physical capital like machinery, tools, buildings, materials, etc. Variable capital refers to labor power, which is the capacity of workers to do work in exchange for wages. Marx argued that while constant capital is essential for production, it does not itself create new value. Instead, it merely transfers its value to the new products it helps produce. The value of the constant capital diminishes as it wears out or becomes obsolete, and this depreciation is reflected in the value of the output. In contrast, Marx believed that variable capital, or labor, is unique in that it has the ability to create value beyond its own cost (the wages). This excess value, which is the source of surplus value, is appropriated by capitalists as profit. So, within the Marxist framework, while physical capital is critical for enabling labor to produce more efficiently and in greater volumes (thus, increasing output per labor unit), it does not generate surplus value by itself. It's the human labor that interacts with the means of production that is capable of creating additional value beyond what is necessary to replace the cost of the labor power, leading to the generation of surplus value, which capitalists then capture as profit. Marx’s analysis also notes that over time, capitalists invest more in constant capital relative to variable capital to increase productivity. However, this leads to a tendency for the rate of profit to fall, according to Marx, because less new value is being created proportionately by labor, which in his view is the sole source of surplus value. This is known as Marx's law of the tendency of the rate of profit to fall and is a contentious and heavily debated topic within economics."},{"prompt":"and what is surplus value?","completion":"Surplus value is a central concept in Karl Marx's critique of political economy and his analysis of capitalist production. It refers to the difference between the value of the goods and services produced by workers and the wages they are paid for their labor. According to Marx, surplus value is a form of unpaid labor and the source of profit for the capitalists. Here's a breakdown of the concept: **Value of Labor Power**: In Marx's theory, labor power is a commodity that workers sell to capitalists. The value of this labor power is determined by the amount of socially necessary labor time required to produce the goods and services that the worker and their family need to survive and reproduce the labor force. This value is paid to the worker in the form of wages. **Creation of Value**: When workers are employed, they use their labor power to work with machinery, tools, and raw materials (collectively called the means of production) to create products. Through the labor process, workers add value to the materials they work with. **Surplus Value**: Workers often produce more value through their labor than the cost of their labor power (wages). The surplus value is the excess value created by workers over and above the value of their labor power. This additional value is not paid to the workers; instead, it is appropriated by the capitalist (the owner of the means of production). Put simply, if it takes 4 hours of labor to produce value equivalent to the worker's daily wage, but the worker works 8 hours, the additional 4 hours of work produce surplus value, which the capitalist then realizes as profit upon the sale of the products. **Exploitation**: Marx viewed the extraction of surplus value as a form of exploitation because workers do not receive the full value of their contribution to the production process. The capitalist system, in Marx's view, is designed in such a way that workers have to sell their labor power to survive, as they typically do not own the means of production. The concept of surplus value is used by Marx to explain the capitalist's motivation for investing in technology and means of production. By increasing the productivity of labor, the capitalist can increase the amount of surplus value generated. However, increasing productivity often involves a higher ratio of investment in constant capital (machinery, tools, etc.) over variable capital (labor), which can lead to other consequences in the economy, such as the aforementioned tendency for the rate of profit to fall. In essence, surplus value is the underpinning of Marx's understanding of profit in capitalist economies and is key to his analysis of class relations, where the bourgeoisie (capitalist class) benefits from the exploitation of the proletariat (working class)."},{"prompt":"五、整理有关正态分布的知识内容，并在生活中举一个（近似）符合正态分 布的例子（需含有具体数据），说明其中的参数所表达的实际意义，并说明你对 正态分布的理解","completion":"正态分布是一种常见的概率分布，也称为高斯分布。它有以下特征： 1. 对称性：正态分布是一种对称分布，即左右两侧的概率密度函数曲线是关于均值对称的。 2. 峰度和偏度：正态分布的峰度是常数3，表示其曲线的峰度与标准正态分布相同。偏度为0，表示其曲线的峰度与对称正态分布相同。 3. 参数：正态分布由两个参数决定，即均值（μ）和标准差（σ）。均值决定曲线的中心位置，标准差决定曲线的宽度。 在生活中，身高（以厘米为单位）是一个（近似）符合正态分布的例子。根据统计数据，假设男性成年人的平均身高为175厘米，标准差为6厘米。 这里的均值μ=175厘米，表示男性成年人的平均身高。 标准差σ=6厘米，表示男性成年人身高的变异程度，即大部分男性成年人身高分布在平均身高的6厘米范围内。 根据正态分布的理解，我们可以得出以下的理解： 1. 大部分事件或数据在均值附近集中分布，而离均值越远，出现的概率越小。 2. 标准差表征了数据的离散程度，标准差越小，数据越集中；标准差越大，数据越分散。 3. 在正态分布中，对称分布的曲线左右两侧的面积相等，即正负离均值同样远的数据出现的概率相等。 正态分布在生活中的应用广泛，例如在统计学、物理学、经济学和工程学等领域都有应用。可以通过正态分布对数据进行描述、分析和预测，并用于假设检验和置信区间估计等统计推断。"},{"prompt":"The 2020 U.S. House election.

However, while Democrats maintained control, Republicans made gains, which was contrary to many pre-election forecasts. - **Impact of Redistricting**: Redistricting had not taken place since the 2020 Census data was not yet available. The districts used in this election were based on the 2010 Census. - **Campaign Issues**: Key issues during the campaign included the federal response to the COVID-19 pandemic, health care, the economy, and the impeachment of President Donald Trump that took place earlier in the year. - **Election Results**: The Democratic Party retained control of the House, but with a slimmer majority. They won 222 seats, while the Republican Party increased its share to 213 seats. The results were considered a disappointment for Democrats, who lost ground to Republicans. Consequently, this reduced divided government, with Republican gains serving as a counterbalance to Democratic control of the presidency and the House. - **Leadership**: Nancy Pelosi continued her role as Speaker of the House after being re-elected by the Democratic majority. Meanwhile, Kevin McCarthy remained the Republican leader. - **Notable Outcomes**: A few races were particularly notable either due to the prominence of the candidates, the closeness of the race, or their symbolic significance. For example, several incumbents lost their seats in upsets, and a number of new representatives, including those belonging to The Squad and other progressive Democrats, maintained their positions or expanded their influence in the House. The 2020 House elections set the stage for the 117th U.S. Congress and influenced the legislative agenda and the balance of power in Washington during the early years of the Biden administration."},{"prompt":"The popular vote?","completion":"The popular vote in the 2020 U.S. House elections, like in any congressional election, refers to the total number of votes cast for Democratic and Republican candidates across all 435 House races. Unlike the presidential election, where the popular vote is often discussed in the context of the Electoral College, the popular vote in House elections serves as a direct measure of the number of votes each party received nationwide. In the 2020 House elections, the Democratic Party candidates collectively received more votes than the Republican candidates, which is often the case for the party that controls the presidency. Despite this, as mentioned in the summary, Republicans gained seats in the House. While the overall popular vote does offer some insight into national party preference, individual House races are decided on a district-by-district basis. As a result, the popular vote is not necessarily indicative of the number of seats a party will win due to factors such as the geographic distribution of voters, local issues, the popularity of individual candidates, and the effects of gerrymandering, which can concentrate or dilute voting power. As an aggregate, the popular vote can signal the country's general political leanings at the time of the election, but for the reasons stated, it does not translate directly to the makeup of the House of Representatives."},{"prompt":"50.3% vs 47.2%","completion":"The numbers you provided, 50.3% vs 47.2%, are figures that represent the percentage of the nation-wide popular vote for each of the two major parties in the United States during the 2020 House of Representatives elections. In the 2020 elections, House Democratic candidates won approximately 50.3% of the total votes cast across the country for House races, while House Republican candidates won about 47.2% of the total votes. Despite Democrats receiving a greater share of the total nationwide popular vote, they experienced a net loss of seats, while Republicans made gains, reducing the Democratic majority in the House. The numbers illustrate that while more voters collectively chose Democratic candidates across the country, due to the way House districts are drawn and votes are distributed, the results in terms of seat allocation were more favorable to Republicans. The difference between the popular vote percentage and seat outcome underscores the importance of district-level races and the impact of factors such as gerrymandering, which can influence electoral outcomes in the United States."},{"prompt":"The 2022 U.S. House elections, if New York district map 2020 was not struck down.","completion":"In the 2022 U.S. House elections, the district maps used were subject to redistricting following the 2020 U.S. Census. Every ten years, after the census, congressional maps are redrawn to reflect population changes and to ensure equal representation. In New York State, there was significant controversy over the redistricting process, which led to legal challenges and court interventions. Initially, maps that were perceived to favor Democrats were proposed by the state legislature, which was controlled by Democrats. However, these maps were challenged in court, and in March 2022, the New York Court of Appeals, the state's highest court, struck down the proposed district maps, ruling that they were unconstitutionally gerrymandered. As a result of this ruling, a special master (an independent, non-partisan court-appointed expert) was tasked with drawing new, less partisan district maps for New York's 2022 congressional elections. The new maps were considered more favorable to Republicans than the struck-down maps and likely had an impact on the outcomes of the 2022 elections in New York. Had the original 2020 district maps proposed by the New York legislature not been struck down, the outcomes of the 2022 elections in New York could have been different. The original maps could have potentially allowed Democrats to win more seats than they did with the less partisan maps drawn by the special master. The 2022 races in the new districts resulted in a closer split between Democrats and Republicans in New York. Nationally, Republicans gained a narrow majority in the House of Representatives following the 2022 midterm elections, with the results in New York playing a part in this outcome. If the maps favorable to Democrats had been used, it might have affected the balance of power in the House, though it's important to note that many factors beyond redistricting influence election results, including national political tides, local issues, and candidate quality."},{"prompt":"The estimated amount of seats","completion":"Predicting the estimated number of seats that a political party could win in a given election based on proposed district maps is a complex and inexact science, often hinging on a variety of factors including political climate, individual candidates, campaign strategies, voter turnout, and more. If the 2020 district maps proposed by the Democrats in New York had not been struck down, it is likely that they would have been designed to maximize Democratic representation, possibly resulting in a greater number of seats for Democrats. However, since those maps were indeed struck down and replaced with districts drawn by a court-appointed special master, we have no reliable way to determine the exact number of seats that would have changed hands in the 2022 U.S. House elections if those maps had stayed in place. It would be speculative to give a hard number without detailed modeling and a thorough analysis of each district under the struck-down maps, including a consideration of incumbents, challengers, and voting patterns. For context, the redrawn maps, which were implemented for the 2022 election, produced a relatively even split between Democratic and Republican seats in New York, whereas the proposed maps that were struck down were expected to favor Democrats more heavily. It's reasonable to assume that under the more Democrat-friendly maps, the Democrats could have won additional seats in New York, possibly impacting the narrow Republican majority attained in the overall results. However, assigning a specific number to this hypothetical scenario requires more data and falls within the realm of electoral analysis and prediction rather than established facts."},{"prompt":"218-217 GOP majority. That will be a lot of chaos","completion":"Yes, a narrow majority in the U.S. House of Representatives can lead to a more challenging legislative environment. If the Republicans hold a 218-217 majority, as seen in some projections for the 2022 midterm elections, this margin allows for very little room for internal dissent or disagreement. In such a closely divided House, a few key points to consider would include: - **Leadership Challenges**: The House Speaker and other leaders may have difficulties in ensuring party discipline, as losing even a single vote from within their own ranks could derail legislation or other initiatives. - **Legislative Agenda**: Passing major legislation becomes more complex with a slim majority, as it forces party leaders to accommodate the diverse views within their caucus to avoid defections. - **Bipartisanship**: While a narrow majority could necessitate reaching across the aisle to secure enough votes to pass certain bills, deep partisan divides may make such cooperation difficult. - **Governing Stability**: Routine procedures, such as passing budget resolutions or raising the debt ceiling, could become highly contentious events, with the potential for government shutdowns or other crises if consensus cannot be reached. - **Vulnerability**: Each member's vote becomes highly crucial, which means that absences or vacancies could impact the majority's ability to govern effectively. Moreover, members may use the narrow majority as leverage to advance specific individual or factional interests. - **Electoral Impact**: Representatives from the majority party, particularly those in swing districts, might face harder re-election campaigns if there is a perception of chaos or an inability to govern effectively. Each of these factors contributes to the potential for political volatility and unpredictability within the legislative process. While a narrow majority is still a majority and gives the controlling party the power to set the agenda and chair committees, it also creates a situation where meticulous negotiation and strategy become paramount to achieve any legislative success."},{"prompt":"How many speaker attempts will Kevin McCarthy take? He took 15 with 222-213","completion":"As of my knowledge cutoff date in March 2023, Kevin McCarthy, a Republican Congressman from California, won the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives of the 118th Congress after several rounds of voting. It took 15 ballots for him to secure enough votes to become Speaker. This was the first time in a century that the election for Speaker extended beyond a single ballot. The Speaker vote took place against the backdrop of a slim Republican majority following the 2022 midterm elections, where Republicans held 222 seats against Democrats' 213 in the House. McCarthy faced opposition from a faction within his own party, which prolonged the voting process as he worked to address the concerns of dissenting Republican members and negotiate terms that would bring them on board. The repeated ballots to elect McCarthy reflected the division within the Republican Party and the challenge of maintaining unity in a narrowly divided House. With each round of voting, McCarthy and his allies negotiated with holdouts on a range of issues, including changes to House rules and other concessions, until he finally secured the Speakership. Ultimately, the number of attempts it took to elect the Speaker was unprecedented in modern times, signaling the potential challenges that lay ahead for McCarthy in governing with such a narrow majority. The process also highlighted the significant influence that a small group of legislators can have in the balance of power when the majority is slim."},{"prompt":"What if they had, instead of 222-213, had 218-217?","completion":"If the Republicans had secured a slim 218-217 majority in the House of Representatives following the 2022 midterm elections rather than the 222-213 majority, the process of electing the Speaker could have potentially been even more difficult for Kevin McCarthy. With such a razor-thin margin, any single Republican defection could have resulted in a failure to elect a Speaker, assuming that all Democrats voted uniformly against McCarthy. Each dissenting Republican vote would have required McCarthy to either win over a Democrat (which would have been highly unlikely in such a partisan climate) or persuade a different Republican holdout to support his candidacy. A 218-217 majority would have meant McCarthy had no room for error. The demands of dissenting Republican members could have been even more significant in this scenario, and the negotiations more intense, as each of their votes would have been absolutely crucial. It might have taken more concessions or rule changes to bring skeptical members of his party in line, and the process could have become longer and more unpredictable. Additionally, the entire legislative agenda would have been precarious with a 218-217 majority. Any bill could have been blocked by a single member crossing party lines or choosing not to vote. This dynamic could have led to more power for individual House members and small groups, making it challenging to achieve legislative victories. In such a closely divided House, it would also be likely that the stability of McCarthy's speakership would be in question constantly, as the potential for a no-confidence vote or other parliamentary challenges would always be present due to the narrowness of the majority. In summary, if the House majority had been just a one-vote difference between parties, the implications for governance, the legislative process, and internal party dynamics would have been even more significant, with every vote becoming immensely consequential."},{"prompt":"Would a MIA GOP lead to Hakeem Jeffries becoming House speaker as minority government?","completion":"In the United States House of Representatives, a Speaker is elected by a majority of those present and voting, provided that a quorum is in attendance. A member must receive an absolute majority of the votes cast, not just a plurality. Typically, this means that the Speaker candidate from the majority party, in this case, the Republicans, would be elected, as they would have the necessary votes if all members vote along party lines. However, if enough members of the majority party (GOP) are missing in action (MIA) or abstain from voting, then it is mathematically possible for a minority party candidate to be elected Speaker if they can secure a majority of the votes cast. In a situation where Republicans had a narrow majority, such as a hypothetical 218-217 split, and enough Republican members were absent or chose not to vote for any candidate (effectively reducing the number of votes needed for a majority), a minority party candidate like Hakeem Jeffries could theoretically be elected Speaker if: - All Democrats were present and voted uniformly for Jeffries. - The absent or non-voting Republicans reduced the number required for an absolute majority, and that new number was less than or equal to the total number of Democratic Representatives. It is highly unusual and unlikely for the minority party candidate to be elected Speaker because typically, parties use caucus meetings to ensure unity and agreement on their Speaker candidate before the vote reaches the House floor. Members of the majority party would generally try to avoid the embarrassment and the significant political consequences of failing to elect their candidate. If such an unlikely event were to occur, where the minority party's candidate becomes Speaker due to absent members from the majority party, it would still not lead to a \\"minority government\\" in the American context. The term \\"minority government\\" typically refers to parliamentary systems where the executive branch is directly dependent on the legislative branch's support. The United States operates under a system of checks and balances with a separate executive branch; thus, the party with the most seats in the House, even if it loses the Speakership, doesn't create a minority government situation as understood in parliamentary terms."},{"prompt":"Could Kevin McCarthy take over 50 attempts with 218-217?","completion":"Whether Kevin McCarthy would have taken over 50 attempts to become Speaker under a hypothetical 218-217 GOP majority is speculative. However, as the number of attempts increases from the actual 15 ballots he underwent to win the Speakership, it does suggest that with an even slimmer majority, the process would have been significantly more difficult. In such a scenario, where the Republicans have only a one-seat majority (218-217), the margin for dissent would have been nonexistent. McCarthy would have needed the support of every single Republican member to secure the Speakership if all Democrats voted against him, which is the usual practice in Speaker elections. Any Republican dissent would have required McCarthy to either convert a dissenting Republican or, in a very unlikely turn of events, persuade a Democrat to support him. If McCarthy failed on multiple consecutive ballots due to dissent from his own party members, the number of attempts could increase substantially as negotiations and concessions continued. It would be essentially a tightrope walk—any absence, illness, or steadfast dissent could grind the process to a halt. House Republicans would have been under immense pressure to come to an agreement and avoid the spectacle and potential political damage of an excessively drawn-out Speaker election process. In practical terms, it's hard to imagine the process extending to over 50 ballots, especially as the pressure from the public, media, and within the party would grow with each failed vote. Both historical precedent and the dynamics of Congress suggest that members would likely seek to resolve the situation before reaching that extreme number of attempts. The number of ballots it takes for a Speaker candidate to secure enough votes depends inherently on the political dynamics within the party and the willingness of dissenting members to compromise and unify as a caucus. While the process McCarthy faced was historically protracted, there is a practical limit to how long members of Congress would allow the situation to persist before making the necessary compromises or considering alternative candidates."},{"prompt":"What if Dems win the House and 2010 and gerrymandered in response to Republicans?","completion":"If the Democratic Party had won control of the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2010 midterm elections and had engaged in extensive gerrymandering in response to Republican efforts, the American political landscape might have been significantly different in the subsequent decade. Here's how that could have hypothetically influenced elections and governance: 1. **Altered Electoral Map**: Democratic control of more state legislatures and governorships following the 2010 elections would have given the party greater influence over the redistricting process that followed the 2010 census. If Democrats had aggressively gerrymandered districts to favor their own party, they could have created more \\"safe\\" seats for their candidates, potentially leading to a more durable majority in the House of Representatives. 2. **Legislative Impact**: With a majority in the House and potentially more leverage in the redistricting process, Democrats might have been able to pass more of their legislative agenda during the Obama presidency, including more robust versions of key legislation or policy initiatives that had been curtailed or blocked due to Republican opposition. 3. **Political Climate**: Intense partisan gerrymandering by Democrats might have further escalated the \\"arms race\\" of using redistricting for political advantage, leading to even more polarized and less competitive congressional races. This could have amplified partisan divisions within the country and the government. 4. **Public Reaction**: Gerrymandering is often criticized by the public and advocacy groups for undermining democratic principles of fair representation. If Democrats were perceived as embracing the practice, it could have affected public opinion of the party and potentially motivated reform efforts to address redistricting abuses. 5. **Long-Term Consequences**: The effects of such gerrymandering would likely have been felt for the entire decade until the next round of redistricting after the 2020 census. It's possible that this could have altered the balance of power in Congress and influenced the outcomes of the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, as well as state and local governance. In reality, Republicans made significant gains in the 2010 midterms, taking control of the House of Representatives and numerous state legislatures at a crucial time for redistricting. This allowed them to carry out an extensive gerrymandering campaign known as REDMAP (Redistricting Majority Project), which shaped the political map for the following decade and helped them maintain control of the House for eight years. In recent years, there has been growing momentum behind efforts to reform the redistricting process and reduce partisan gerrymandering, including the establishment of independent redistricting commissions in some states. The goal of these reforms is to create fairer and more competitive electoral maps, but the legacy of gerrymandering from both parties continues to influence the political process."},{"prompt":"In this scenario, Dems won a slim 222-212-1 majority in 2010. In addition to this Project REDMAP was leaked to Democrats, leading to Dems also gerrymandering in response.","completion":"In an alternate scenario where Democrats won a slim majority of 222-212-1 in the 2010 midterm elections and learned of the Republican strategy (Project REDMAP) to aggressively gerrymander districts, and then decided to respond in kind, several consequences could have unfolded: 1. **Intense Gerrymandering Battles**: Both parties, armed with sophisticated mapping technologies and data analytics, would have engaged in intense gerrymandering efforts to solidify their power in their respective states. This could have resulted in an even more politically polarized national map, with each party creating safe districts to shield incumbents and marginalize opponents. 2. **Increased Partisanship**: With districts drawn to favor one party heavily, the Congress elected from these districts would likely be more partisan and polarized. Politicians representing safely gerrymandered districts might feel less incentive to compromise or reach across the aisle, leading to gridlock on legislative issues. 3. **Judicial Intervention**: The increase in partisan redistricting might have prompted more frequent and intense legal battles over the constitutionality of the districts. The courts, including potentially the Supreme Court, could have been asked to rule on the legality and fairness of the mapped districts, which might have accelerated the call for judicial standards regarding gerrymandering. 4. **Public Backlash and Calls for Reform**: An escalation in gerrymandering might have heightened public awareness of the practice, leading to greater demands for reform. The push for independent redistricting commissions, as seen in states like California and Michigan, might have gained traction earlier as citizens sought to reduce the influence of political parties on the drawing of electoral maps. 5. **Electoral Impact**: The 2010s would likely have seen less competitive races and more predictable outcomes in congressional elections due to gerrymandered districts. This could have impacted the balance of power in the House leading up to the 2020 census and subsequent redistricting. 6. **Legislative Consequences**: A Democratic majority in the House would have allowed President Obama and the Democratic Party to have more control over the legislative agenda, potentially affecting the passage of key legislation like the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). 7. **Long-Term Political Dynamics**: Gerrymandering by Democrats in response to Project REDMAP could have set different long-term political dynamics. Incumbency advantages might have been significantly higher, leading to potential entrenchment of party power in certain regions. The political landscape heading into the 2020s might have been substantially altered, impacting state-level politics and federal elections. Remember, this scenario is purely hypothetical. In reality, Republicans were successful in their REDMAP strategy, resulting in substantial gains at both the state and federal levels. That advantage allowed them to shape the congressional landscape for much of the 2010s. The true effects of such an alternate history can only be speculated upon, as the actual outcomes would depend on numerous variables including voter turnout, public opinion, and unforeseen political events."},{"prompt":"How would it affect the 2012 U.S. House election?","completion":"In a hypothetical scenario where Democrats emerge victorious in the 2010 U.S. House elections with a 222-212-1 majority and also engage in gerrymandering in response to the leaked Project REDMAP, the 2012 House elections would have likely been affected in several key ways: 1. **Democratic Incumbent Protection**: Gerrymandered districts designed to favor Democrats would likely have strengthened the positions of incumbent Democratic representatives, reducing the number of competitive districts and making it harder for Republican challengers to win seats. 2. **Reduced Republican Opportunities**: Conversely, the Republicans would face increased difficulty in gaining ground due to the reduced number of vulnerable Democratic seats. Their path to regaining the House majority would be more challenging if Democrats effectively gerrymandered districts in their favor. 3. **Altered Campaign Strategies**: With gerrymandered districts shaping the electoral map, both parties would have to adjust their campaign strategies, focusing resources primarily on the few remaining competitive districts rather than spreading efforts across a broader landscape. 4. **Impact on Voter Turnout and Engagement**: Gerrymandering can contribute to voter apathy and decreased turnout due to the perception of predetermined electoral outcomes in noncompetitive districts. This would likely affect campaign dynamics and voter engagement in the 2012 elections. 5. **Impact on Overall National Political Climate**: The 2012 House elections would take place in a context where both parties are perceived to have actively engaged in manipulation of district boundaries. This could further entrench partisan divides and affect national rhetoric surrounding fairness and democracy in elections. 6. **State-Level Effects**: In states where Democrats controlled the redistricting process and drew favorable maps, the party would likely see improved performance in the 2012 House elections compared to states where they did not have such control. 7. **Downstream Effects on Legislation and Governance**: Retaining the House majority would give Democrats continued leverage in national policy-making alongside President Obama, who was running for reelection in 2012. Legislative agendas on healthcare, climate change, immigration, and the economy could be pursued with greater confidence. 8. **Longevity of Majority Control**: If the Democrats' gerrymandering was successful in maintaining their majority in 2012, it might have given them an advantageous position to control the House for the remainder of the decade, depending on the effectiveness and sustainability of the gerrymandered districts. 9. **Legal and Reform Movement Acceleration**: An aggressive gerrymander by Democrats, in response to REDMAP, could have led to an expedited legal response and potentially hastened the movement for redistricting reform, including the use of independent commissions or other nonpartisan approaches to drawing districts. It's important to keep in mind that this is a speculative analysis; it's challenging to predict with certainty how these altered district boundaries would play out in practice. Real-world results depend on various factors including candidate quality, national mood, economic conditions, and unforeseen political events."},{"prompt":"Led to 235-199-1 majority of Dems.","completion":"In an alternate scenario where aggressive Democratic gerrymandering led to a 235-199-1 majority for the Democrats in the 2012 U.S. House elections, the political implications could have included: 1. **Democratic Legislative Power**: With a strengthened majority in the House, Democrats would have had an easier time advancing their legislative priorities during President Obama's second term. Potential gridlock might have been reduced, and more ambitious policy initiatives in areas like education, climate change, healthcare, or immigration reform could have been pursued. 2. **Reduced Republican Influence**: Republicans, facing a larger Democratic majority, would have had less leverage to influence the legislative agenda or block Democratic proposals. Their role in the House would likely have centered more on defense and trying to win over moderate Democrats on close votes. 3. **Impact on Obama's Presidency**: The outcomes of the House elections could have had a significant effect on the Obama administration's second-term effectiveness. Larger majorities in both the House and continued control of the Senate, if that were the case, would have allowed for potentially greater legislative achievements. 4. **National Mood and Voter Sentiment**: A Democratic majority of that size could have either been seen as a mandate for Democratic policies or could have intensified partisan polarization. Voter sentiment could have been affected by perceptions of overreach or, conversely, by satisfaction with the direction of government policy. 5. **Effect on State Politics**: A Democratic advantage in the House due to gerrymandering at the state level could have reinforced or shifted the balance of power in state legislatures, further influencing local policy decisions. 6. **Changes in Campaign Dynamics**: With more non-competitive districts, campaign funds and strategies would have been concentrated in the remaining competitive districts, altering the national political campaign landscape. 7. **GOP Response and Strategy Adjustments**: In response to a larger Democratic majority, the GOP would likely have adjusted its strategies and possibly its platform, with the aim of appealing more broadly to voters and regaining the majority in future election cycles. 8. **Redistricting and Electoral Reform Debate**: Such a shift might have reignited debates around redistricting practices, leading to increased efforts for reform, including movements for independent redistricting commissions or court interventions in various states. 9. **Impact on 2014 Midterm Elections**: With Democrats holding a significant majority in the House, the narrative and dynamics of the 2014 midterm elections would have been different. Historically, the party holding the presidency tends to lose seats in the midterms, so Democrats would be on defense to maintain their majority against the usual trend. 10. **Long-Term Political Landscape**: The Democratic majority could have impacted the political landscape well into the 2010s and possibly affected the 2016 presidential election, depending on whether voter sentiments leaned more toward continuity or change. It should be stressed that such a scenario is purely speculative and builds upon a series of assumptions about political behavior and electoral outcomes. The real-world impact of such a gerrymandering effort would depend on a multitude of factors, including the quality of candidates, changes in public opinion, economic conditions, and major national and international events."},{"prompt":"2014 U.S. Election - Although the GOP won 4.6% more of the popular vote, they only won 219-217.","completion":"In a hypothetical scenario where the GOP won 4.6% more of the popular vote in the 2014 U.S. midterm elections but only achieved a narrow majority of 219-217 in the House of Representatives, it would suggest several significant political dynamics: 1. **Democratic Gerrymandering Impact**: The narrow margin of seats won by the GOP, despite a sizable advantage in the popular vote, would indicate that Democratic gerrymandering efforts from previous cycles were effective in protecting incumbents and minimizing Republican gains. This would have countered some of the impact of the natural advantage Republicans might have had due to their own gerrymandering efforts in other states or due to geographic voter distribution that tends to favor them in rural areas. 2. **Limited GOP Majority**: A slim majority of two seats would have provided Republicans with control of the House but with very little room for internal dissent. Any close vote would have required near-absolute party unity among Republicans, reducing their ability to pass more controversial or partisan pieces of legislation. 3. **Legislative Gridlock**: Such a slim majority might have increased the likelihood of legislative gridlock, especially on contentious issues, and amplified the importance of moderate members from both parties, who might have served as swing votes in certain cases. 4. **Boost for Democrats**: From a psychological and strategic standpoint, the ability of Democrats to hold the GOP to a narrow majority despite losing the popular vote by a significant margin could have been seen as a victory for the party. It might have given Democrats momentum and a platform from which to argue for regaining control in the next election. 5. **Increased Partisanship**: The narrow majority would likely have heightened partisanship, as Republicans might have felt they needed to maximize the use of their control, while Democrats would feel emboldened to resist given their strong popular vote performance. 6. **Frustration Among Voters**: The discrepancy between the popular vote and the number of seats gained could contribute to voter frustration and concerns about fairness and representation, potentially spurring further calls for redistricting reform. 7. **Focus on Swing Districts**: Campaign strategies would increasingly focus on a small number of competitive districts, further polarizing the political climate and driving funding and resources to those battlegrounds. 8. **Strategic Adjustments for 2016**: Both parties would likely have to adjust their strategies ahead of the 2016 presidential election, with Republicans potentially feeling the need to broaden their appeal to protect their narrow majority, and Democrats aiming to capitalize on their strong popular support. 9. **Implications for Leadership**: For GOP leaders, especially the Speaker of the House, managing such a narrowly divided chamber would have been extremely challenging, requiring careful negotiation and coalition-building skills. It's important to remember that this is a hypothetical situation—the actual 2014 midterm elections saw Republicans gaining a comfortable majority in the House. This scenario demonstrates how gerrymandering and electoral mechanics can affect election outcomes and underscores the complex relationship between the popular vote and legislative seat distribution."},{"prompt":"2016 - With a more Successful Obama, Clinton won 2016, with 67 million votes vs Trump with 62.8 million votes. Dems regain House 231-204, despite losing popular vote by 0.9%.","completion":"In a hypothetical scenario where Hillary Clinton won the 2016 presidential election with a more successful track record from President Obama's administration, and Democrats regained control of the House with a 231-204 majority despite losing the popular vote by 0.9%, several key factors and implications would come into play: 1. **Presidency Influence**: A \\"more successful\\" Obama term leading up to the 2016 election could refer to stronger economic indicators, legislative victories, or international successes that translated into greater public approval for the Democratic Party, thus boosting Clinton's chances over Donald Trump. 2. **House Seat Distribution vs. Popular Vote**: The Democrats regaining the House majority despite losing the popular vote could indicate the lasting impacts of their gerrymandering efforts, effectively protecting Democratic incumbents and securing key district victories. This scenario would also reflect the role of district-level factors, local campaigns, and the strategic distribution of voters. 3. **Polarized Electorate**: A popular vote loss but a seat majority win for the Democrats could further highlight the polarized nature of the U.S. electorate, where regional and local dynamics generate electoral outcomes that may not align with the national popular vote. 4. **Legislative Agenda**: With Clinton's victory and a reclaimed Democratic House majority, the legislative priorities could shift markedly from what occurred under the Trump administration. Initiatives aligned with Democratic values, such as healthcare expansion, environmental regulation, and immigration reform, could move to the forefront of the political agenda. 5. **Judicial and Executive Branch Dynamics**: Given the presidency and control of the House, Democrats would have an opportunity to make judicial appointments and enact executive actions with less Republican opposition, potentially shaping the federal judiciary for years to come. 6. **Senate Dynamics**: The scenario does not specify the Senate outcome. However, if the Senate remained Republican or closely divided, it would still serve as a potential check on a Democratic president and House. 7. **Political Reactions**: The GOP losing a presidential election that followed a more positively viewed Democratic presidency could lead to an identity crisis within the Republican Party, potentially prompting a reevaluation of policy positions, messaging, and leadership to regain competitiveness. 8. **Public Perception and Electoral Reform**: A discrepancy between the popular vote and election outcomes (both presidential and House) might have exacerbated public concerns about the U.S. electoral system, particularly the Electoral College and gerrymandering, leading to increased calls for reform. 9. **Impact on Future Elections**: Democratic successes in the 2016 elections could have implications for future electoral cycles, potentially shaping voter behavior, party strategies, and the political landscape for the 2018 midterms and beyond. It is crucial to underscore that this scenario is purely hypothetical. In the actual 2016 elections, Donald Trump won the presidency, and Republicans maintained control of the House and Senate. Speculating on different outcomes can provide insights into potential political dynamics, but actual electoral behavior is contingent on a complex interplay of factors, including candidate appeal, economic conditions, social issues, and world events that unfold in unique and sometimes unpredictable ways."},{"prompt":"2018 election : Republicans regain house, 229-206.

This scenario typically leads to legislative gridlock, especially on partisan issues, since bills passed by one chamber may be stalled or altered significantly in the other chamber. 2. **Impact on the Clinton Presidency**: Assuming Hillary Clinton won the presidency in 2016 in this hypothetical situation, the shift in the House would mark a typical midterm correction where the party of the sitting president often loses seats. This would affect her administration's ability to pass new legislation and complicate efforts to build on progress from her first two years. 3. **Senate Dynamics**: Control of the Senate with a razor-thin margin would give Democrats the capacity to set the legislative agenda, confirm presidential nominees (including judicial appointments), and potentially conduct oversight or investigations into the executive branch. However, moderate senators from both parties would wield considerable power, as a single defector could change the outcome of votes. 4. **Legislative Priorities**: With the Senate in Democratic hands and the House controlled by Republicans, bipartisan cooperation would be necessary to pass any substantive legislation. Priority policy areas might include those with some cross-party support or where compromise could be reached. 5. **Investigations and Oversight**: The House, with its investigatory and oversight functions, could choose to initiate or intensify probes into Clinton's administration, impacting her presidency's public perception and policy agenda. 6. **Policy Stalemates**: Areas of significant policy difference between the parties, such as healthcare, taxation, immigration, or environmental regulations, may see little to no legislative progress, with both sides focusing on positioning for the next election cycle. 7. **Budgetary Challenges**: Essential tasks like passing spending bills and raising the debt ceiling might become contentious, with high-stakes negotiations and the risk of government shutdowns if consensus cannot be found across the divided Congress. 8. **Election Implications**: The outcomes of the 2018 midterms would certainly influence strategies heading into the 2020 presidential campaign, shaping narratives around governance, party effectiveness, and voter mobilization efforts. 9. **Public Reaction**: With a sharply divided Congress reflecting deep national partisan divisions, public sentiment may become further polarized. Calls for political reform and attention to issues like electoral integrity and redistricting may intensify. 10. **Pressure on Moderates**: Moderate members of both parties in each chamber could become pivotal players, as their votes might tip the balance on close decisions. Remember, this scenario is hypothetical and deviates significantly from actual historical events. In reality, the 2018 midterm elections resulted in Democrats gaining control of the House, while Republicans expanded their Senate majority. How the given circumstances would play out would be contingent upon the specific context, lawmakers' decisions, and the broader political climate at the time."},{"prompt":"2020 - Thanks to better COVID response, Clinton won re election against Trump, and regains house 241-194, expand majority in senate, 52-48","completion":"In this alternative timeline where a more effective COVID-19 response leads to Hillary Clinton winning re-election in 2020 against Donald Trump, and Democrats regain the House with a 241-194 majority while expanding their Senate majority to 52-48, the following political consequences might ensue: 1. **Clinton's Mandate**: Clinton's re-election, coupled with congressional majorities, would likely be interpreted as a strong mandate from the electorate. This could empower her to push forward with key policy priorities, including further healthcare reforms, climate change initiatives, and economic recovery measures in response to the pandemic. 2. **Legislative Momentum**: The bolstered Democratic majorities in both houses of Congress would enable Clinton to pursue a more ambitious legislative agenda. With control of both chambers, Democrats would face fewer obstacles in passing legislation and advancing policy changes. 3. **COVID-19 Management**: Continued success in managing the COVID-19 pandemic would remain a top priority, with potential public health measures, economic stimulus packages, and infrastructure investments aimed at post-pandemic recovery. 4. **Senate Dynamics**: A 52-48 majority in the Senate would give Democrats more leeway than a 50-50 split, but they would still have to manage moderate and progressive factions within their ranks to maintain unity on key votes, particularly given the filibuster. 5. **Judicial Appointments**: A Senate majority would facilitate the confirmation of Clinton's judicial nominees, allowing her to shape the federal judiciary, including potential Supreme Court appointments, which could have long-lasting implications. 6. **Regulatory and Executive Actions**: With a supportive Congress, the Clinton administration could advance regulatory reforms and executive actions in line with Democratic policy objectives without as much legislative resistance. 7. **Republican Reassessment**: Republicans facing a second consecutive defeat to Clinton and diminished congressional representation might undergo a period of introspection and strategy recalibration, potentially shifting their positions or leadership in response to the losses. 8. **Increased Partisan Tensions**: Although victorious, Democrats could face intensified opposition from Republicans who may unite more solidly as a resistance against the majority's agenda. 9. **Impact on State and Local Politics**: Democratic successes at the federal level could have downstream effects on state and local races, influencing voter behavior and party strategies in subsequent elections. 10. **International Relations**: A second Clinton term could have significant implications for U.S. foreign policy, including a focus on strengthening alliances, confronting global health challenges, and addressing climate change on the international stage. It is important to emphasize that such scenarios are speculative and exist within a simplified framework. In reality, election outcomes and political climates are shaped by complex, multilayered factors that interact in unforeseen ways. The 2020 elections in actuality resulted in Joe Biden winning the presidency and Democrats eventually gaining control of the Senate with a 50-50 split, with Vice President Kamala Harris casting tie-breaking votes, alongside achieving a slim majority in the House."},{"prompt":"Pelosi has stated that, GOP gerrymandering efforts in 2010 has backfired, and it's a lesson to GOP","completion":"While it's accurate that former Republican gerrymandering efforts have come under scrutiny for potentially creating challenges even for the GOP itself over time, the direct quoted statement from Nancy Pelosi about GOP gerrymandering efforts in 2010 backfiring and serving as a lesson to the GOP would require verification from a credible source. Political figures often critique the gerrymandering practices of opposing parties, especially when those practices lead to significant political advantages. The effects of gerrymandering are complex and can have both intended and unintended consequences. Here are some points that have been observed and discussed in political analysis and commentary, which may align with suggestions of gerrymandering backfiring: 1. **Creation of Ultra-Safe Districts**: Gerrymandering by the GOP in 2010 led to the creation of many ultra-safe Republican districts. While this solidified Republican control in those districts, it also had the unintended side effect of concentrating conservative voters, potentially making other districts more competitive or even favoring Democrats. 2. **Polarization and Primary Challenges**: By creating safe districts, gerrymandering may encourage political polarization, as representatives from these districts feel pressure to appeal to their base rather than reach across the aisle. This can lead to more extreme candidates emerging from primaries, potentially making it challenging for the party to appeal to a wider electorate in statewide or national contests. 3. **Changing Demographics**: Over time, demographics within districts can shift. Areas that were once solidly Republican may become more competitive due to population changes, urbanization, or shifts in political attitudes, undermining the original gerrymander. 4. **Court Challenges and Reforms**: Aggressive gerrymandering has faced legal challenges, and some states have reformed their redistricting processes to reduce partisan influence, implementing independent redistricting commissions or state constitutional amendments. 5. **Public Backlash**: Public awareness and backlash against gerrymandering have grown. This has led to increased calls for redistricting reform and a higher level of scrutiny for gerrymandering efforts. It is possible that lessons learned from the 2010 gerrymandering efforts by the GOP have influenced how both parties approach redistricting, particularly as discussions about fairness and representation become more prominent. There's a broader understanding that while gerrymandering can provide short-term electoral advantages, it can also create long-term vulnerabilities and is subject to unpredictable demographic and political changes over time. As for specific statements made by Nancy Pelosi or other political figures, attributing direct quotes would require access to up-to-date records or public statements verifying those claims. It's always best to reference the original sources when discussing such claims."},{"prompt":"Clinton appoints Garland after a year of vacancy, Kennedy retires in 2018, and Ginsburg dies in 2020, to be both replaced by a Clinton appointee.","completion":"In a hypothetical scenario where Hillary Clinton won the presidency in 2016, and assuming that the Republican Senate that was in place at the end of President Obama's tenure had left the seat vacated by Justice Antonin Scalia unfilled, President Clinton would have had the opportunity to make several appointments to the U.S. Supreme Court if the following events occurred: 1. **Merrick Garland Appointment**: With a year-long vacancy after the death of Justice Scalia, President Clinton could have chosen to nominate Merrick Garland, whom President Obama had nominated but who was not granted a confirmation hearing by the Republican-controlled Senate. If confirmed, Garland would have brought a more centrist or moderate-liberal perspective to the Court. 2. **Justice Kennedy's Retirement**: Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was often seen as the swing vote on the Court, retiring in 2018 under a Clinton presidency would have provided another opportunity for Clinton to shape the Court's future. If she appointed a liberal or progressive justice, it would have moved the Court's ideological balance further to the left. 3. **Justice Ginsburg's Death**: With the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 2020, President Clinton would have made yet another appointment, replacing Ginsburg with another liberal justice to maintain the balance or potentially shifting the Court even further left, if the other appointments were also on the liberal side. The impact of these appointments under a Clinton presidency would have been significant: - **Ideological Shift**: The Supreme Court would likely have seen a considerable shift toward the left, potentially solidifying a liberal majority for years to come. - **Influence on Major Decisions**: With a change in the Court's ideological makeup, major legal issues such as reproductive rights, healthcare, environmental regulations, and voting rights could have had different outcomes compared to what has been decided under the more conservative Court in the actual timeline. - **Impact on Public Policy**: A more liberal Supreme Court could have had broad implications for American public policy, affecting the direction of U.S. law on a wide range of social and economic issues. - **Political Ramifications**: The change in the Supreme Court would have had a profound impact on the political landscape, potentially becoming a major factor in future elections, as voters who prioritize the Court's composition could be mobilized in different ways depending on the perceived balance of the Court. It is important to note that in the actual 2016 election, Donald Trump won the presidency, and the seat vacated by Justice Scalia was filled by Trump's nominee, Neil Gorsuch, in 2017. Justice Kennedy retired in 2018 and was replaced by Brett Kavanaugh, also nominated by Trump. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg passed away in September 2020, and Trump nominated Amy Coney Barrett as her replacement, who was confirmed by the Senate. As this is a speculative scenario, it assumes particular political conditions, such as the composition and leanings of the Senate, that would have allowed for the successful confirmation of hypothetical nominees. Supreme Court nominations and confirmations can significantly alter the Court's trajectory and are thus among the most lasting aspects of a president's legacy."},{"prompt":"How would a 6-3 liberal majority cause the rulings in Janus, Rucho, and Dobbs?","completion":"In a hypothetical scenario where the U.S. Supreme Court had a 6-3 liberal majority because of appointments by a President Hillary Clinton, the outcomes of significant cases like Janus v. AFSCME, Rucho v. Common Cause, and Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization could have been quite different from what occurred in reality. Let's consider each case: 1. **Janus v. AFSCME (2018)**: In the actual case, the Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 decision that requiring public sector union non-members to pay agency fees is a violation of the First Amendment. The majority opinion held that forcing individuals to subsidize a union they might not support infringes on their free speech rights. In a Court with a 6-3 liberal majority, it's possible that the outcome could have favored the unions, maintaining the precedent set by Abood v. Detroit Board of Education, which allowed such fees as promoting labor peace and reducing free-riding. 2. **Rucho v. Common Cause (2019)**: This case involved the question of whether partisan gerrymandering claims are justiciable—that is, whether courts can rule on them. The Supreme Court in a 5-4 conservative majority decision held that partisan gerrymandering claims represent political questions beyond the reach of the federal courts. With a 6-3 liberal Court, the justices might have been more inclined to view such claims as justiciable, possibly leading to a ruling that would have allowed federal courts to adjudicate cases of extreme partisan gerrymandering. 3. **Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization (2022)**: In reality, this case resulted in a 6-3 decision (with a conservative majority) that overturned Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, thus eliminating the federal constitutional right to an abortion. With a 6-3 liberal majority, the Court would likely have reaffirmed the protections under Roe v. Wade and Casey, preventing states from banning abortion before viability and maintaining the established constitutional right to choose an abortion. It is important to note that while the ideological composition of the Court can provide an indication of how justices may align on various issues, it is not a guarantee of specific outcomes. Justices can sometimes rule in ways that defy simple ideological categorization based on the specific legal arguments and constitutional interpretations presented in each case. However, having a solid liberal or conservative majority does generally influence the Court's direction on foundational matters of law and social policy."},{"prompt":"A hypothetical court case in 2019, repealing Citizens United with 6-3 liberal majority.","completion":"If a hypothetical case challenging the Citizens United v. FEC decision reached the Supreme Court in 2019, and the Court had a 6-3 liberal majority, it is plausible that the landmark 2010 decision could have been overturned or significantly modified. **Background on Citizens United v. FEC**: In the actual Citizens United case, the Supreme Court held in a 5-4 decision that the government could not restrict independent expenditures for political communications by corporations, associations, and labor unions. The ruling was grounded in the principle of free speech under the First Amendment, and it has had a profound impact on campaign finance, leading to the rise of super PACs and a significant increase in the amount of money spent in U.S. elections. **Hypothetical Repeal Scenario**: In the hypothetical 2019 case where the Citizens United ruling is under challenge, the liberal-majority Supreme Court would likely be more receptive to arguments that highlight the negative effects of the decision on electoral politics and democratic governance. These arguments might focus on: - The disproportionate influence of wealthy individuals and corporations in elections. - The potential for corruption or the appearance of corruption due to large, often undisclosed, contributions to political action committees. - The need to promote electoral equality and protect the integrity of the voting process. Given a 6-3 liberal majority, the Court could issue a ruling that finds certain types of campaign finance restrictions to be constitutional, thereby upholding the government's interest in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption in elections. Such a ruling could effectively reverse or dramatically curtail the precedent set by Citizens United. **Potential Legal and Political Implications**: Overturning Citizens United would have substantial legal and political ramifications, including: - Changes to Federal and State Campaign Finance Laws: The decision could clear the way for a new regime of campaign finance regulation, potentially restoring previous limits on corporate and union spending in elections or establishing entirely new frameworks for curbing the influence of \\"dark money.\\" - Shift in Political Campaign Strategies: Political campaigns would likely have to adjust their funding strategies and may see a decrease in the effectiveness of super PACs and other independent expenditure groups. - Public Reception: Depending on public sentiment, the repeal could be met with widespread approval from those who have criticized the influence of big money in politics, or it might galvanize opposition among free speech advocates and those who support the deregulation of campaign finance. - Congressional Response: Congress might be prompted to legislate new campaign finance regulations consistent with the new legal landscape. - Increased Litigation: Further legal challenges could arise as new regulations are implemented and tested against the revised constitutional standards for campaign finance. Keep in mind that this discussion is based on a hypothetical scenario, and the actual decisions of the Supreme Court involve complex legal analyses and considerations that may not always align neatly with ideological predictions. Supreme Court justices can rule in unexpected ways, and such significant shifts in constitutional jurisprudence typically rely on strong legal underpinnings and compelling arguments presented in the cases before them."},{"prompt":"How do I associate a static final string with every class that extends Animal?

Every lingering touch and shared smile is a world apart from their public personas—a declaration of love in a quiet act of rebellion against the pace of their lives. A soft melody drifts, an analog record player spinning a tune that seems composed for moments such as this. Ed and Maria rise, joining in an intimate dance—a slow, gentle sway, as if the notes themselves guide their movements. ED (softly, into her hair) Forget the breakthrough, the cure, the fame.

A rat, motionless in its cage mere hours ago, now twitches erratically - life electrifying death, its eyes aflame with a resurgence that defies nature. EDWARD “ED” KAYNES watches via a remote link from his safehouse, his face a mix of horror and disbelief. His fingers hover over the keyboard, hesitant to accept what unfolds before him. INSERT - MONITOR FOOTAGE The rat rises, a Frankenstein’s creature reborn. It frenzies against the confines of its cage, a tiny titan testing the mettle of man’s creation. Numbers and graphs on the screen depict a pulse quickening — a grim harbinger of the plague unleashed. BACK TO SCENE ED’s worst fears confirmed, he zooms in on the screen — closer, closer, until the nightmarish detail of the creature’s eyes fills the monitor, yesterday’s breakthrough become today’s curse. A sound escapes his lips, a whisper: ED (whispering in disbelief) …no. As the creature breaks free, its escape captured by the indifferent lens, alarms crescendo into a haunting dirge. Precious seconds tick away, time slipping into the jaws of an escalating disaster. CUT TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 5 OF 150 (Note: The tensions wrought by the day’s achievements and the evening’s peaceful respite now give way to the thrumming heart of disaster. The transformed rat embodies the nascent terror, its escape from the cage a metaphor for the coming chaos. This rewrite heightens the sense of dread and deepens the urgency for what’s to come.

Suddenly, an eerie scuffle breaks the stillness. On a deserted alleyway, a HOMELESS MAN huddles for warmth, unaware of the danger lurking. His eyes snap open, on edge, and fear takes hold as he spots several figures moving with an unsettling, lurching gait towards him. The ragged silhouettes grow clearer - zombies in various stages of decay. Wasting no time, the man scrambles to his feet, but his movements are sluggish, still dulled by sleep. He turns to flee, but the undead descend upon him with relentless hunger. His panicked screams shatter the silence of the night, a symphony of terror that marks the dawn of a new horror.

Immediate response needed… He realizes the helplessness of his position, the futility of calling for aid already too late for the unfortunate victim. His hand shakes as he switches off the monitor, the image of the undead’s assault burned into his memory.

MEDICAL STAFF dash from bed to bed, desolation etched into their faces as they face the inevitable. DR. MARTINEZ, her eyes showing the night’s toll, marshals her team like a battlefield commander. DR. MARTINEZ (shouting over the cacophony) Move the critical cases to isolation! Now! Orderlies hurry by, pushing a gurney with a PATIENT whose twitching betrays the infection’s advance. CUT TO: EXT. SCIENCE CITY PARK - DAYBREAK The park, once a refuge of mirth, now stands ominously silent. A CHILD’S BIKE lies discarded on its side, the nearby swings creaking in the wind as if mourning the loss of laughter. A distant, guttural SCREAM pierces the morning air.

The creature’s rebirth is captured in grainy detail—a grotesque interruption in the sanitarium of science. DR. STEVENS (voice cracking) Look at it… nobody could have predicted this. It’s like a nightmare. ED (tight-jawed) We created a monster… Maria’s hand covers her mouth as she stifles a sob. The knowledge that their breakthrough is responsible for the terror gripping the city is an unbearable burden. MARIA (overwhelmed) Our children… are they… DR. STEVENS (interrupting, grim) I’ve been trying to reach the schools all morning. Communications are down city-wide. We don’t know who’s… who’s still alive. Ed slams a fist on the console in frustration, his rage a silent scream challenging the chaos. Maria turns to him, eyes pooling with tears—desperation etched on her face. MARIA (pleading) We have to do something, Ed! ED (resolute) And we will. We fix this. We find the cure and distribute it. No rest until this damn virus is eradicated from every last soul it’s touched. They stand united, a feeble bulwark against an abyss that threatens to consume the world they know. CUT TO: EXT.

Despite his scientific mind rebelling against the logic of their existence, his survival instincts kick in. They back away slowly, but the zombies advance with increasing hunger. The corridor’s confines amplify their mangled cries. Ed and Maria turn to run, but the creatures are relentless in pursuit. One of the zombies lunges forward, catching ED by the arm. Its teeth sink into his flesh—a searing pain that echoes with the unbearable finality of his fate. MARIA (screaming) Ed! She pulls Ed away with a strength born of desperation, dragging him toward a nearby reinforced door. They stumble through just in time, slamming it shut on their assailants. INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE ROOM - CONTINUOUS The couple slumps against the door, breathing heavily. Ed grunts as he clutches the wound, blood oozing between his fingers—a cruel testament to their perilous situation. MARIA (tearfully) It’s not deep, we can treat it. ED (panting, pain-ridden) Maria… I don’t have much time… MARIA (shaking her head) Don’t say that. We’ll find the antidote. We’ll… Ed gives a pained smile, his eyes reflecting both love and sorrow. ED (urgently) Listen to me. You need to continue without me. Find the cure, Maria. MARIA collapses beside him, the horror of the moment washing over her. The reality they tried to escape has consumed them, as the weight of their predicament settles like a shroud. FADE OUT.

GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE RESEARCH FACILITY - DAY The room buzzes with the subdued whirr of high-tech machinery. MARIA scrambles, her hands fumbling through vials and medical supplies, searching for anything that might save ED. He lies on a cot, his complexion growing paler, his breaths shallow. MARIA’s hands shake as she uncaps a vial labeled “Prototype Antidote 7A.” Desperation fills her eyes as she fills a syringe and turns to ED with steely determination. MARIA (breathlessly) Ed, this is experimental, but it’s based on our earlier research. It could save you. ED (weakly, but with a firm resolve) Do it… anything for a chance. Maria injects the contents into his arm. They wait, the seconds stretching into an eternity. Suddenly, Ed convulses, a guttural groan escaping his lips as his body reacts to the drug. MARIA (frantic) Hold on, Ed! Hold on! His convulsions slow, then stop. Slowly, his breathing steadies, and the color begins to return to his cheeks. Maria sighs with relief as she watches him, her own body sagging with exhaustion. ED (voice stronger) Maria… it’s working. I can feel it fighting the virus. MARIA collapses beside him, tears of relief streaming down her face. They embrace, a moment of hope amidst the terror that surrounds them. Suddenly, the door bursts open, ZOMBIES spill into the room, their groans filling the air with dread. With a surge of adrenaline, MARIA springs to her feet, seizing a nearby fire extinguisher. She sprays the advancing horde, her other hand grabbing Ed, pulling him towards an emergency exit. ED (urgently) Go, Maria! Get out of here! MARIA shakes her head, determination blazing in her eyes. MARIA (screaming) Not without you, Ed! Just as they reach the door, a ZOMBIE lunges, its teeth bared for Maria’s neck. In a split-second decision, Ed shoves her through the door, slamming it behind her, locking himself inside with the undead. MARIA (desperately pounding the door) ED! No! But Ed’s fate is sealed. As Maria sobs, slumped against the door, the sounds of the scuffle inside fade. A profound silence settles, and a new resolve takes hold. MARIA (vow in her voice) I’ll make it right, Ed. I’ll save them all. CUT TO: EXT. GENEsis LABORATORY - ROOFTOP HELIPAD - CONTINUOUS A helicopter approaches, the wind from its blades scattering papers and debris across the rooftop.

GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE RESEARCH FACILITY - DAY The sterile corridor is now a cacophony of terror. MARIA bears witness to ED’S transformation—skin deathly pale, veins blackening. With the shadow of zombification drawing near, he makes a drastic choice. ED (determined, to Maria) Go! Save our children… save everyone. With a mix of horror and fierce resolve, ED flings himself through the window, landing on the concrete below with an unnatural ferocity only the infected possess. Maria watches as Ed, now imbued with the strength and resilience of the undead but mercifully retaining his mind, staggers to his feet and storms into the city. CUT TO: EXT. CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS With the mind of a scientist but the body of a monster, ED trudges through the chaotic streets, an insatiable need to protect and a relentless drive to find their children fuelling his every step. MARIA, atop the helipad, is torn between following ED and escaping with the cure. Tears stream down her face as she calls out to him, though he can no longer hear her. MARIA (screaming into the void) I love you… I’ll find them, I promise! With the cries of her husband echoing in her ears, Maria vows to carry on their fight and save the city they love. She watches Ed disappear into the horde of zombies, a lone figure of tragedy amidst the devastation. The helicopter, hovering anxiously, becomes her only refuge.

ABANDONED SCHOOL - MORNING ED KAYNES, his body a mismatch of human fear and zombified resilience, slips through the shattered gates of what was once a sanctuary of learning. A tattered scarf partially conceals his grotesque features, signs of his incomplete transformation into the undead. Silently, he navigates the overgrown courtyard, each step deliberate to avoid drawing attention. Windows, dark and soulless, gape open like the eyes of the dead—witnesses to the devastation within. CUT TO: INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS Ed’s entry is a mirror to his internal chaos—a man, formerly a herald of progress, now reduced to a creature of instinct and desperation. His gait, once confident, is now a sober march into the unknown. He tiptoes past classrooms where silent echoes of children’s laughter are replaced by the somber reality of abandonment. Broken furniture and scattered papers litter the floor—a flashback to the day when life unraveled. A weak groan echoes down the hall as Ed pauses, a sideways glance revealing a lone zombie staggering between the desks of what used to be a third-grade classroom. Ed suppresses a shudder, steeling himself against the macabre scenery.

CUT TO: INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS Ed arrives at the gym, a cavernous hollow now home to dust and despair. Sunlight streams through broken skylights, carving shadows that pool like blood on the hardwood floor. He scans the rafters, a haunting tableau of memories and lost days playing out in the sunbeams. As real as the danger is, it’s the threat of finding irrevocable truth that tightens his chest—a father’s fear, potent even in undeath. But there’s no trace, no joyous clamor of children, no after-school exclamations. They’re gone, swept away by the cataclysm that swept through their lives like a malevolent tide. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS Ed emerges from the school, the line between man and zombie blurred by his faltering, heart-wrenching mission. Desolation repels hope like opposite poles of a tragic magnet. Torn by failure, Ed turns away from the forlorn landmark of his children’s laughter, now a crypt to his unspoken fear. His eyes, rimmed with the red of grief and infection, look beyond—towards the distant, fortified silhouette of his bunker. MONTAGE – ED’S JOURNEY TO THE BUNKER: - Ed’s shadow stretches along the cracked pavement as he trudges through the eerie streets, a spectral figure moving against the grain of desolation. - At intersections, he ducks into the shadows, avoiding the roving packs of zombies that cluster around the remnants of life—imperfect kin he no longer resembles. - The bunker’s hidden entrance, a sliver between the ruins, beckons—a sanctuary amid a city usurped by death. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS A blast door seals with an echo, enveloping Ed in the silence of his clandestine refuge. He peels away the scarf, revealing the visage of a man ensnared between two realities. Amid the quiet hum of survival equipment, Ed perches on the edge of a cot, hands clasped, elbows resting on his knees. He is the epitome of the isolated soul—lost in the chasm between the living and the not. Remnants of humanity nest in the bunker—photographs, clothes, a child’s crayon drawing affixed to a wall. Through the stillness, Ed’s rasping breath is a dissonant chorus, filling the void with his internal war. ED (muttering to himself) I’ll find them—alive or… I must. He rises, a gaunt figure against the backdrop of monitors flickering with disconnected surveillance feeds. With grim acceptance, he begins to arm himself for the world above, the haven below now a grave to his former self. END OF PAGE 31 OF 150 PAGE 32 OF 15 INT.

A gasp of despair chokes out as he beholds the naked scalp in the mirror, a stark declaration of his metamorphosis. Tears well up, spilling over, tracing grimy paths down his deformed cheeks. The bunker trembles, a distant cataclysm making the very earth weep. A shelf rattles and the few personal effects he’s salvaged from his previous life threaten to tumble and shatter. ED (Screaming, his voice a ragged echo of rage and fear) NOOOOO! NO!..NO! Overcome with grief, he slams a fist against the mirror, the crack spider-webbing across his fractured reflection. His knees buckle, and he sinks to the ground amidst the fallen hair—an island of agony in a sea of cold tile. His wails fill the cramped space, a chilling symphony to a soul in mourning. And in this moment of anguish, the bunker shakes—dust falling like ancient witnesses to his pain. Shelves rattle, threatening to topple, the explosion’s distant thunder a cruel reminder of the world falling apart above.

CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS The aftermath of the explosion erupts into a chaotic torrent of action—civilian and military alike now share only the common goal of survival. AND CUT BACK TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS ED lunges for a two-way radio, the last line connecting him to the world he fought to save—a world that might no longer exist. His hand caresses the tuning knob, static filling the clean space of the bunker. His voice, modulated by desperation and the unearthly timbre of his new form, crackles into the void. ED (into the radio, desperate) Is anyone out there…? Children… Please… As the static answers back, heavy and relentless, the camera captures a final shot of ED—an echo of humanity caught in the purgatory between life and death. FADE TO BLACK.

On their screens, a digital representation of the missile’s trajectory beelines towards its destination. GENERAL (V.O.) (over intercom, grave) All units, confirm evacuation protocols. Ensure civilian compliance. We’ve done all we can. Prepare for impact. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS With the siren’s song as his grim chorus, Ed scrambles to secure his sanctuary, locking down hatches and reinforcing the entry. Every clank and hiss a harrowing step towards the inevitable. The camera follows his frantic actions, an intimate dance between man and machine, before pausing on his face—a visage caught between primal survival and heart-wrenching grief. ED (whispering to himself) Survive. Survive for what’s left… The bunker’s artificial lights flicker under the strain of the external world crumbling. Ed, a sentinel at the end of days, stares down the immensity of his solitude, the gravity of the moment heavy upon him. His raspy breath is the metronome to the ticking countdown, as the monitors’ once steadfast streams stutter—a digital heart rate faltering as the world prepares for its last beat. END OF PAGE 33 OF 150 PAGE 34 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The stubborn hum of outdated technology fills the air as ED hunches over the mainframe terminal of the bunker, his fingers a flurry over the backlit keys. The screen before him flashes with layers of security access prompts and firewalls, a digital labyrinth of his own design. Ed’s mind, a cocktail of desperation and scientific prowess, races to unlock the secrets he once safeguarded so fervently. With each override command, he peels back the digital veils shrouding his research, his city’s downfall, the truth. With a final keystroke, he breaches the mainframe security. The floodgates open, and data streams onto the monitor—classified communications, military intel, the command chain’s last orders, the enormity of the impending strike. ED (voice barely a whisper, laced with dread) Oh, what have we done… The screen maps out the grim reality—a schematized web showing the approaching missile’s trajectory, projected fallout patterns, and the bleakest scenarios outlined in stark numeric certainty. CUT TO: INT. MILITARY COMMAND BUNKER - DAY Generals hunch over radar screens, the forewarned cataclysm reflected in their stoic faces. Behind them, a wall-sized world map blinks with the Morse code of impending doom. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed’s horrified gaze traverses the information on-screen. His infected constitution wrestles with the gravity of what’s coming—ignited not by a zombie’s viral urges but by a man’s conscience and heart. ED (grappling with the scope of the cataclysm) There’s gotta be… there must be something else we can do… Anyone… He scans the screens for any sign of hope, a ceasefire, an alternative to the end. But the truth is unyielding, encoded in the logic of machines and strategic calculations. CUT TO: EXT. OBSERVATION POST - DAY A lone soldier stands sentinel, binoculars to his eyes, the distant whistle of the incoming missile harmonizing with the wail of the air raid sirens—a requiem for the world he knew. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed slams his palm against the terminal, the pain insignificant against his racing thoughts. Bitter laughter, a guttural sound devoid of humor, escapes him as he contemplates the irony—the mad scientist, the living dead, now the audience to Armageddon. ED (to himself, the laugh collapsing into a growl) We played with life and death… and now we pay the price. He rises, each movement a struggle as he opens a secure drawer, retrieving a dusty bottle of whiskey, a relic from a past life. He unscrews the cap and takes a swig, the burn a fleeting reminder of human sensations. Ed’s bloodshot eyes, tinged with yellow, fix on the countdown—a digital grim reaper ticking away the seconds of existence. FADE OUT: END OF PAGE 34 OF 150 PAGE 35 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker, once a bastion of safety, becomes a tomb as the hollow echoes of explosions reverberate through its concrete walls. ED stands still, the ghastly light of the monitors painting his face as each distant blast grows closer, louder, a chorus of annihilation gaining fervor. He grips the edge of a console, knuckles white, each rumble a hammer strike against the shield of isolation he’s erected around himself. The shockwaves travel through the floor, a tremor through the heart of the earth. CUT TO: EXT. OUTER LAYERS OF THE CITY - CONTINUOUS Overhead shots reveal fiery blooms littering the landscape, each a bitter bloom of conflict. Plumes of smoke claw at the sky, trying to blanket the sun with their unforgiving shadows. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Panic fractures Ed’s stoicism as the bunker’s survival systems activate in response to the escalating threat. Crimson alarms flare, casting a sinister glow. The ventilation system churns violently, fighting against the onslaught of the inferno waiting outside. Each detonation outside is a gut punch to the facility, the sound magnified by the silence it disrupts. Flickering screens cast erratic shadows across the walls, creating an ominous dance of light that foreshadows the end. ED (voice choked with dread) This is how it ends… Not with a whimper, but with a bang. CUT TO: INT. FAMILY SHELTER - CONTINUOUS A FAMILY huddles together, their embrace a fortress within the shuddering bunker. Children clutch their parents, eyes wide and uncomprehending, as the reverberations of the unthinkable shake their sanctuary. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS Ed slumps into his seat, resigned, the bottle slipping from his grip and rolling across the floor. The world outside may be ending, but his torment continues unabated—a curse of the undead. A single tear—unclear if it’s from sorrow or the zombie affliction—trails down his face. He watches the countdown dwindle; humanity’s tenure ticking away before his crypt-colored eyes. FADE OUT: END OF PAGE 35 OF 150 PAGE 36 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker convulses as if gripped by an unseen giant, the roar of the impact wave a deafening crescendo punctuating the still air. ED is launched from his chair, thrown to the unforgiving floor as the earth itself seems to spiral into chaos. Around him, the walls tremble, panels and ceiling tiles clattering down in a discordant symphony of destruction. The monitors blink erratically, skewing the horrific show they present—something between reality and electronic hallucination. CUT TO: EXT. CITYSCAPE - SAME MOMENT From afar, a nightmarish scene unfolds as the impact wave rips through city blocks, turning structures into dust and dreams into nightmares. The force is indiscriminate—it tears through steel like paper, glass like vapor. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed clutches at debris, dragging his altered body across the trembling floor, desperately attempting to anchor himself in a world that refuses stillness. His roars match the sound of tearing metal and shattering concrete—primal, raw, filled with terror. CUT TO: SERIES OF SHOTS - BUNKER’S DISTRESS: A. The once orderly rows of canned goods and emergency provisions cascade onto the now-tilting floors. B. Water pipes burst, geysers erupting in formerly dry rooms, while electrical sparks create a dangerous light show. C. A portrait of Ed’s family, clinging to the wall, now slips free and crashes to the ground, the glass protecting their smiles shattering. BACK TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed, crawling through the mayhem, reaches for the bunker’s emergency protocols—a last-ditch hope to seal away the cataclysm that hunts for him within his sanctuary. Lights flicker overhead, many winking out, as the integrity of their fixtures fail. He hits the master lockdown button, and with a metallic groan, reinforced doors slide shut, drowning the chaos into muffled fury. The sanctuary becomes sarcophagus. Over the din of destruction, Ed’s distorted cry resonates—half man, half beast, all despair. ED (screaming above the noise) Survive! I must… survive… The camera pulls out from the scene, leaving Ed a solitary, writhing figure amidst the anarchy that ensnares him—an amalgam of man’s hubris and the savage grip of nature’s retribution, locked in a bunker, locked in turmoil. FADE OUT: END OF PAGE 36 OF 150 PAGE 37 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Amidst the chaos and the runaway dance of shadows and light, ED struggles against the unforgiving floor that refuses to stay still beneath him. His limbs, misshapen by his condition and shaken by the concussive forces, push against the tiles with a strength born from the darkest depths of survival instinct. Grit and dust cake his flesh as he labors for breath, a horrifying rasp that competes with the bunker’s groans and the distant, thunderous booms that refuse to fade away. Pain lances through him; whether from the fall, the shockwaves, or his own internal transformation, it’s impossible to tell. But it fuels him, drives him—the agony a reminder of life amidst a landscape that speaks only of annihilation. CUT TO: EXT. CITY RUINS - SAME MOMENT A cloud of dust and debris blankets the horizon where the city once teemed with life. The singular fury of the initial blast has given birth to countless offspring—sporadic eruptions that devour the remnants of a world now confined to memory and echoes. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed gasps, his body hauled up to an unsteady crouch, fingertips white-knuckled as they grip a shattered piece of the console for support. Desperation swims in his eyes—a cocktail of torment, the will to endure, the knowledge that to succumb now is to surrender to the void. He scans the room through the haze, sees the sealed blast doors, the blinking red of systems barely clinging to function. In this stolen pause, where death seems to have drawn in a breath, Ed finds a semblance of order amidst the tumult. ED (voice a raspy whisper tinged with determination) Not yet… Not today… Tremors wrack his form, but they cannot break the spirit that fuels his battered frame. This bunker, this grave, this womb—it will not be his terminus. With a shake of his head, Ed stands fully, a testament to defiance. His cries subside to murmurs, to mantras of survival that carry him forward—a symphony played against the thunderous backdrop of the world’s end. FADE TO BLACK: END OF PAGE 37 OF 150 PAGE 38 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker’s foundation rattles under the relentless assault, dust cascading like tiny waterfalls from the ceiling. ED, half-zombie, stands amidst a glistening coat of sweat and grime, swaying unevenly as the earth beneath him convulses. He fixates on the emergency lighting, its flickering a spasmodic dirge to the rhythm of apocalypse, his mind racing with primal urgency. Every painful breath is a struggle, drowning in a sea of helplessness and confusion. His flesh, marked both by the zest of the undead and the scars of scientific torment, stretches over his hands as if trying to flee from the bone. His ashen lips mutter a garbled prayer to loved ones lost to either fate or the flame. Ed staggers forward, a mote of dust in the grim tableau of his sanctuary. He salvages a heavy crowbar from the scattered arsenal of survival tools. Its heft gives him a grotesque sense of purpose—a weapon against the barriers that cage him. Footsteps echo with thunderous intent, resonating upon the metal floor, as he assumes the stance of one prepared to battle titans. With a grunt, he wedges the crowbar into the seams of a heavy looking hatch, muscles and sinews bulging in grotesque relief against his lab coat. The strain reddens his eyes, fueling veins with an unnerving fervor. Gritted teeth are bared, the intonation of pained struggle filling the space, as he channels every ounce of his monstrous strength into the task. The metal groans, protesting, as if the very bunker itself is aware of Ed’s unwinnable war against time. With each incremental victory of leverage, the raw scrape of crowbar against hatch is a requiem for reason, a siren call of the myriad dead and dying above. ED (straining, a whisper to himself) Survive, protect, endure… No matter the cost. A sudden lurch, and the hatch gives way, surrendering to Ed’s determination with a scream of yielding steel. A dim shaft of light, alien in the confines of the bunker, pierces the grimy air—a fragile thread leading back to the chaos of a once familiar world. Ed, panting, a line of blood trickling from where the crowbar had slipped, rights himself—a ghastly architect of his own salvation or doom, straddling two realms he never wished to know. The bunker stands defiant, its heart now exposed. And as the camera zooms out, Ed, the anomaly, reaches toward the beckoning light—a specter grappling with the very essence of existence and annihilation. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 38 OF 150 PAGE 39 OF 150 EXT. CITYSCAPE - DAY From the depths of the bunker, ED emerges into a world transformed beyond recognition. A vast wasteland of destruction stretches before him, the cityscape now a twisted shadow of its former self. The ground, littered with debris and the remnants of buildings, challenges every step. Yet Ed advances, his silhouette a stark contrast against the backdrop of a demolished city. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Back inside the shaking bunker, Ed’s hands move with purpose, fueled by an unyielding instinct for survival and protection. He scans the room, now a collapsed chamber of his former life, searching for anything that will aid his escape. He spots his toolbox, hurled by the tremors to a corner. Within lies a collection of tools, each associated with a memory of maintenance and preparedness, each now essential for a far grimmer purpose. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED STREET - CONTINUOUS Ed navigates the treacherous terrain. He grips a robust pipe wrench, repurposed now as a cudgel to fend off the encroaching undead and clear his path of obstacles. His movements are mechanical, devoid of the finesse of the living but driven by a persistent will that seems almost alien in these ruins. Each swing of the wrench is a statement of defiance, a claim to life in a realm of death. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS Ed approaches a mound of rubble where a building once stood. Determination etches his features as he sets about methodically removing pieces of concrete and twisted metal. With each thrust and pry of his makeshift tools, he paves a way through the destruction. His movements are heavy but precise, the products of a mind that refuses to surrender to defeat. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED OVERPASS - CONTINUOUS Ahead lies the skeletal remains of what was once a vital overpass, its concrete bones a grim parody of the city’s past prosperity. Ed braces himself and climbs, his upheaved hands finding cracks and purchase among the debris. His progress is slow and arduous, but the sight of the overpass’s peak, a symbol of hope, spurs him onward. CUT TO: EXT. CITYSCAPE - HIGH ANGLE - CONTINUOUS Ed reaches the summit of the overpass and pauses, his gaze sweeping over the horizon. The wreckage stretches as far as the eye can see, but this height gives perspective—there is a path to be forged, a direction to take. He takes a deep breath, the air a mingled scent of dust and destruction, and raises his wrench high. It’s a gesture of both challenge and resolve, a signal that his journey through this nightmare has only just begun. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 39 OF 150 PAGE 40 OF 150 EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - DAY ED’s lone figure is dwarfed by the gaping wound of the city. His every step is a testament to his unshakable resolve. The wrench, now an extension of his will, pierces the rubble blocking his path. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSED SUBWAY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS Ed approaches the maw of a collapsed subway entrance. Sunlight pierces through the cracks, casting slivers of light that dance on the mangled steel and broken tiles. With each piece of debris he removes, the way forward becomes clearer. He works in silence, his breaths and the sound of falling concrete the only interruptions in the deathly quiet. CUT TO: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS The darkness of the tunnel envelops Ed as he descends. The beam from his makeshift torch, fashioned from a rag and salvaged alcohol, flickers against the walls, throwing exaggerated shadows around him. He navigates the shattered remains of the underground with a mixture of zombie-like indifference and human caution, the two natures merged into one being, surviving by instinct and intellect. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS Ed emerges onto the cracked surface of a highway, once a vein pulsing with life, now a silent artery in a dead metropolis. He takes a moment to scan the expanse for movement, for any sign of those like him or worse. Empty cars stand as monuments to a sudden catastrophe, their doors agape, their stories untold. CUT TO: INT. CRUSHED CAR - CONTINUOUS Ed peers through the window of a half-collapsed vehicle. Inside, a skeleton grips the steering wheel, a stark reminder of society’s abrupt end. For a moment, Ed sees himself—not so different from the bones. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - OVERLOOK - CONTINUOUS Climbing atop a pile of rubble that offers a vantage point, Ed scans the horizon. His heart, whatever is left of it, aches. The city lies in ruins, but amidst the desolation, there is a faint echo of hope—a whisper of life. CUT TO: EXT. NARROW CREVICE BETWEEN BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS Ed finds a narrow passageway, wedged between two faltering skyscrapers. The space is tight, claustrophobic, but the fresh air beckoning from the other side is unmistakable—a breath of the world beyond. He squeezes through the gap, the walls scraping against his flesh, now so foreign to pain. As he emerges, the air hits him like a wave of the past. It’s tinged with the acrid scent of smoke and decay, yet underneath it all is the undeniable smell of survival. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - CONTINUOUS Ed stands at the threshold of the crevice, the firmament open before him. He takes a long, deep breath, feeling the air churn within his lungs—half-life, half-death. A resolve settles deep within his marrow. He steps forward, leaving the shadows behind. Ahead, the path is fraught with ruin and remembrance, but it is his to tread. With the wrench slung over his shoulder, Ed sets out into the sunlit devastation, a figure of determination silhouetted against the crumbling silhouette of a fallen world. FADE OUT.

Restlessness yields to relief as they share a moment of reprieve. In this sanctum, the day’s triumph feels immediate and personal. It’s a respite from the world of laboratories and scientific accolades—a chance to revel in an accomplishment all their own. Ed, tension easing from his shoulders, appreciatively surveys the room—each surface bearing the mark of their shared life and successes. MARIA (teasing, offering a glass) To the future—may it be as bright as your most optimistic hypothesis. ED (accepting the glass, playful smirk) It’s proven science now, no longer just a hypothesis. They toast, glasses chiming softly, and sink into the familiar embrace of their couch—a stark contrast to the antiseptic confines of the lab. Contentment settles around them, a comforting blanket ensuring the world’s weight can wait a little longer. Maria tilts her head, capturing Ed’s gaze with an affectionate look. MARIA (sincere) You know, this breakthrough, it’s not just ours—it’s humanity’s. But tonight, let’s just be Ed and Maria, not scientists, not pioneers. Just… us. Ed nods, grateful for the solitude and sanctuary of their bond. As they clink glasses, the collected memorabilia of their careers—the articles, letters, awards—are merely shadows to the reality of them, here and now, together. Their laughter fades as they draw close, the rest of the evening dedicated to a celebration for two. Every lingering touch and shared smile is a world apart from their public personas—a declaration of love in a quiet act of rebellion against the pace of their lives. A soft melody drifts, an analog record player spinning a tune that seems composed for moments such as this. Ed and Maria rise, joining in an intimate dance—a slow, gentle sway, as if the notes themselves guide their movements. ED (softly, into her hair) Forget the breakthrough, the cure, the fame. You’re the real miracle in my life. Maria responds, her hand clasping tighter to his. MARIA (voice barely above a whisper) And you are my constant, through every success and every unknown. As they linger in the embrace of the dance, the world beyond the curtains continues to turn, unaware of the risk drawn from the very elixir of life they’ve concocted. But for now, for Ed and Maria, time stands still, the storm can wait, and love remains unchallenged. FADE OUT.

ED AND MARIA’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Their HOME is a warm bastion as ED and MARIA enter, the brightness of their day's discovery seemingly following them inside. It drapes the room in an indefinable glow that speaks of comfort and shared joys. MARIA, hanging her lab coat, allows herself a moment of respite. She pours wine into two glasses, reflecting the deep red of their lab's breakthrough substance. MARIA (cheerily, raising her glass) To life, to love, to limitless horizons. ED (with a resonant laugh) And to every secret of the universe we're yet to unlock. Their glasses CLINK, the sound crisp in the quietude. They settle into a familiar tango of easy banter, a well-rehearsed routine as natural as the theories they devise. ED (sipping, his eyes gleaming with intent) But, my dear Maria, science can wait. Tonight is about us. MARIA (teasingly) Are lab rats invited to this celebration? They LAUGH; the sound is genuine, devoid of academic rigor, filled with the rich timbre of life. Around them, the living room responds—a mantle of their achievements in science, now a mere backdrop to their humanity. ED (casually) Only if they've contributed to groundbreaking work! Maria PLAYS with the hem of Ed's shirt, her touch light but laden with the weight of shared ambition. MARIA (softer now) Today was ours, Ed. But it's also a doorway... To what future, though, I wonder? ED (grasping her hand) Whatever it holds, we step through it together. Their embrace is a gentle collision, the world narrowing to just the two of them. The fireplace CRACKLES, underscoring a rare moment of tranquility. Suddenly, Ed STEERS Maria toward the old record player tucked in a corner, its presence a quiet homage to tradition. ED (whispers) Dance with me? MARIA (with mock protest) But, Dr. Kaynes, I have two left feet! They SPIN into a dance, their movements a visual sonnet, each step a word, their laughter the melody. The record SCRATCHES out a melody that promises to keep their secrets. ED (a whisper of sentiment) In this dance, we write our story – without words, without discoveries, simply in steps. MARIA (a gentle rebuke) No more talk of the lab, my love. Our hearts' beating is all the discovery I need tonight. The atmosphere is now hefty with meaning, a DIALOGUE of looks and touches. The AMBIENCE of their home carries them through the song—a celebration of today's victory and tomorrow's unknowns. As the music FADES, they come to rest, foreheads together, the world around them a distant echo. MARIA (speechless whisper) Just remember, even if you turned out to be mad, you'd still be my favorite scientist. ED (choked with emotion) And you, my brilliant darling, are my forever.

В этой игре, Эд участвует в гротескном телешоу, созданном человеком по имени Ханз Шоумастер. Шоу называется \\"Rundead\\", где Эд должен пройти через серию зловещих препятствий и испытаний, чтобы в конце концов встретиться с Беном. Полный сюжет фильма \\"RUN ZOMBIE, RUN\\": Акт 1: Введение в мир и персонажей Открытие фильма: • Фильм начинается в мирное время, в современном научном городе, где жизнь кипит и наука бурлит. • Эд – талантливый учёный, занятый исследованиями в области биотехнологий вместе со своей женой и коллегами. Они стоят на пороге прорыва: создания вакцины для вечной жизни и молодости. • Научный отдел в восторге от открытия, в лаборатории царит атмосфера торжества. После успешной презентации их эксперимента над крысами, Эд и его жена возвращаются домой, чтобы отпраздновать успех. Шторм наступает: • Интимные моменты между Эдом и его женой дома. Они обсуждают планы на будущее, их романтическая встреча переходит в страстный вечер. • Когда после утро голые с обьятием жены в постели,и через некоторое время начинают звонить в телефон эда и сообщают что в вашем лаборотории что-то случилось не хорошее. • Радость прерывается известием о трагедии: инфицированная крыса умерла и восстала как зомби, сбежав из лаборатории и начав заражение города. • Пока Эд и его жена отдыхают, город погружается в хаос. Зомби-вирус быстро распространяется, затрагивая школы, больницы, улицы. Трагический перелом: • На следующее утро Эд и его жена возвращаются в лабораторию и обнаруживают сбежавшую крысу. Новости сообщают о массовом заражении. • Они пытаются дозвониться до детей и родственников, но безуспешно. Улицы заполнены зомби. Лаборатория осаждена толпой заражённых. • После нападения зомби, Эда укусили, и он принимает экспериментальную вакцину. Он вынужден покинуть свою жену, которая жертвует собой, чтобы спасти его. Ядерный удар: • Эд, полузомби, узнаёт о намерениях властей сбросить на город ядерную бомбу. С помощью своих новых способностей он прячется в подземном бункере. • Бомба стирает город с лица земли, уничтожая всех его обитателей, как живых, так и мёртвых. Акт 2: Развитие сюжета и персонажей Эд выходит на поверхность: • После взрыва Эд, один из немногих выживших, покидает своё убежище. Мир, который он знал, больше не существует. • Он встречает Бена, мальчика-сироту, выжившего в руинах города. Между ними завязывается необычная дружба. Выживание в разрушенном мире: • Эд и Бен ищут припасы и остатки цивилизации, стараясь выжить среди развалин и постоянной угрозы зомби. • По мере их путешествия за руинами, Эд начинает терять остатки своего человечества и борется с внутренними демонами. Акт 3: Кульминация и разрешение конфликта Шоу \\"Rundead\\": • Ханз Шоумастер, выживший продюсер, создаёт телешоу \\"Rundead\\" и похищает Бена, чтобы использовать его в качестве приза для Эда. • Эд, теперь полностью зомби, но сохранивший воспоминания о Бене, проходит через жестокие испытания шоу. Финальная битва и трагедия: • Эд освобождает Бена, но внезапно теряет остатки человечности и атакует его, не в силах сопротивляться своему зомби-инстинкту. • Бен превращается в зомби, и они уходят вместе, оставляя мир во власти хаоса и зомби-апокалипсиса. Заключение: • Фильм заканчивается на тёмной ноте. Эд и Бен, теперь оба зомби, сидят на разрушенном мосту, смотря на новый мир, который никогда не будет таким, каким был когда-то. Фильм \\"RUN ZOMBIE, RUN\\" показывает темную сторону человеческой изобретательности и последствия игры с природой. Со смешанными чувствами ужаса и сочувствия зрители следят за путешествием Эда от великого открытия до конечного падения в бездну живых мертвецов. Саундтреки будут браться из оригинальной игры BEN AND ED (2015 года) Дополнительные саундтреки: 1. Песня Yota - The Runner, финальная сцена, где зомби ED будет бежать c предпринимателем HANZ SHOWMASTER который создал величайшее в мире шоу и будут преодолевать препятствии. Зомби ЭД столкнет HANZ SHOWMASTER c площадки и он умирает. 2. Песня The Cranberries - Zombie, сцена, где весь механизм вышел из под контроля, испытания стали чрезвычайно сложными, и люди которые смотрят это шоу начинают убегать от атаков зомби. Время продолжает заканчиваться и платформа в очень скором времени падает в лаву. Зомби ED берет в себя в руки и начинает быстро преодолевать все препятствия под эту песню за одну минуту, пока время полностью не истекало.

ED (softly) What matters now is that we navigate the path ahead with caution. For every miracle we’ve created, there’s a responsibility we can’t ignore. MARIA (turning to face him) Our dreams could become nightmares if we’re not careful. The joy of discovery, the weight of consequence—we carry them both. ED (nodding) Together, we’ll face whatever comes. Our love, our bond… it’s our anchor amidst the storm. They share a tender kiss, a moment of solace away from prying eyes and probing questions. It’s a promise, a vow unspoken but deeply felt—an acknowledgment of their unity and unwavering support for each other.

MARIA holds her lab coat close, an armor against the palpable weight of the night’s revelations. Ed, with deliberate solemnity, locks away classified materials—information that once promised a brighter future. ED (musing with a trace of sorrow) In our hands, we held the light of knowledge, the hope for mankind’s dawn… MARIA, with measured breath, crosses to join him, a consoling presence in the stillness of their created world. MARIA (voice quivering with resolve) And in our hearts, we’ll carry it still, through whatever lies ahead. This journey… our purpose… it doesn’t end here. They exchange a glance, a silent accord, their shared convictions unshaken. DISSOLVE TO: EXT. GENEsis LABORATORY - NIGHT Ed and Maria emerge from the lab, the door closing with an echo that speaks to the finality of the day. The building stands silent amidst the cacophony of a world it has forever altered. INT. ED AND MARIA’S CAR - NIGHT As they drive through the suspended city—its architecture a geometric lullaby—the stillness envelops Ed and Maria. The car is a vessel adrift in the ocean of an uncertain future, the serenity an unsettling prelude to the sirocco of change. MARIA (softly, almost to herself) What have we done, Ed? The path we’ve chosen… ED (firmly, cutting the tension) …is the right one. Doubt can’t sway us now. We did it for the greater good, regardless of the cost. EXT. ED’S HOUSE - BACK PORCH - NIGHT The two of them, alone against the tapestry of the night sky, settle into a silence under the stars. The darkness is pierced by the soft flicker of candlelight. The porch, a haven in the eye of the storm, is where they find solace. MARIA (a murmur against the night’s whisper) May this peace last, against the tempest that looms. ED gathers MARIA in his arms, a fortress against the coming gale. ED (mutely determined) As long as we stand together, we’ll weather any storm. MARIA leans into ED, her beacon in the twilight. Together, they face the horizon, where dawn’s light contends with the shadows of uncertainty. CUT TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 14 OF 150 PAGE 15 OF 150: INT. ED AND MARIA’S CAR - NIGHT The city’s whispered lullabies trail off as the car snakes through its veins, suspended in the timelessness of night—a pause in the day’s revelation. ED (V.O.) (somber, introspective) In the stillness of the night, the world hears the secrets we whisper to the stars—hopes that shine bright amid the encroaching shadows. Outside, a tapestry of stars battles the city’s fading luminescence, a visual symphony of light and dark mirrored in the weary yet hopeful eyes of our travelers. MARIA (softly, to Ed, with solemn warmth) The path we’ve carved today will shape a thousand tomorrows, entangling our fates with the arc of history. Their glance meets, a bridge of silence spanning between them, weighted with the burden of their creation. CUT TO: The sanctuary of their home awaits as they drift into the driveway. The car’s engine stills, surrendering to the quietude that wraps around them like a protective shroud. ED (turning to Maria, voice steady yet laden) This evening’s promises linger—a testament to our quest. With you, each dawn is a promise kept, each dusk, a vow renewed. Together, they step out into the night’s embrace, their silhouettes hand in hand, retreating from the precipice of their day’s labors into the tranquil respite of their abode. CUT TO: The door to their home closes behind them, sealing away the labors of their past, the uncertainty of their future, surrounded by the familiar. FADE TO BLACK.

They are nestled on a luxurious sofa that is the epitome of modern elegance, yet the room resonates with an old-world charm. A low table is the centerpiece of their intimate setup, decorated with a vibrant bouquet and the soft flicker of candlelight. An open bottle of red wine sits idle, exuding its bouquet into the room, while two glasses sit, their contents slowly savored. Maria finds solace in Ed’s embrace, her body drawn to his as they reflect on the day’s triumph and ponder their shared aspirations. MARIA (beaming with love for Ed) Imagine… we might be on the cusp of history, deciphering the riddle of agelessness. ED (gazing deeply into her soul) And none of this would be possible without you—you are the genius and the lifeblood of our mission. Maria’s cheeks are kissed by a rosy flush as she takes in the accolade, momentarily averting her eyes before locking them with his once more. MARIA (lifting her glass with grace) Here’s to our breakthrough, our journey ahead… and to the bond we share. Their glasses meet in a symphony of crystal, a testimony to their dedication. They drink, a poetic chorus of nocturnal life providing a tender soundtrack. ED (with a voice full of sincerity) Each obstacle has only solidified us. Together, we are invincible against the unknown.

Ed and Maria lie entwined, a peaceful reprieve from the chaos of their lives. Yet as they sleep, fate sits patiently on their doorstep. The incessant RINGING of Ed’s phone slices through the silence—insistent, jarring. He stirs, but Maria nudges him towards the persistent invasion of their tranquility. MARIA (muffled against Ed’s neck) Honey… the phone… ED (grumbling) Let it ring… nothing is more important than this moment. But the phone is relentless. After several ignored calls, Ed finally relents. ED (sighing) Alright… alright… He reaches out, voice heavy with the remnants of sleep and satisfaction. ED (into the phone) Hello? The grave voice of a COLLEAGUE reverberates through the line, shattering the mussed warmth of their sanctuary. CUT TO: Split Screen: Ed’s expressions of ecstasy now contort to one of shock and disbelief. COLLEAGUE (V.O.) (urgent, panicked) Ed—it’s gone wrong. The test subject—it… The blood drains from Ed’s face as the screams from the other side sync with lightning strikes outside. Redeployment from a night of union to one of splitting despair. The camera focuses tight on Ed’s widening eyes, as understanding and dread meld into a chilling realization. CUT TO: Maria looks on, her countenance shifting from tranquil contentment to alarmed confusion. MARIA (in a strained whisper) Ed, what’s happened? The storm outside wails as if to answer.

Suddenly, an eerie scuffle breaks the stillness. On a deserted alleyway, a HOMELESS MAN huddles for warmth, unaware of the danger lurking. His eyes snap open, on edge, and fear takes hold as he spots several figures moving with an unsettling, lurching gait towards him. The ragged silhouettes grow clearer - zombies in various stages of decay. Wasting no time, the man scrambles to his feet, but his movements are sluggish, still dulled by sleep. He turns to flee, but the undead descend upon him with relentless hunger. His panicked screams shatter the silence of the night, a symphony of terror that marks the dawn of a new horror.

Immediate response needed… He realizes the helplessness of his position, the futility of calling for aid already too late for the unfortunate victim. His hand shakes as he switches off the monitor, the image of the undead’s assault burned into his memory. To his horror, he understands that this solitary incident is but the precursor to a city-wide nightmare. The zombies are free, and Science City is their hunting ground. CUT TO: EXT.

MEDICAL STAFF dash from bed to bed, desolation etched into their faces as they face the inevitable. DR. MARTINEZ, her eyes showing the night’s toll, marshals her team like a battlefield commander. DR. MARTINEZ (shouting over the cacophony) Move the critical cases to isolation! Now! Orderlies hurry by, pushing a gurney with a PATIENT whose twitching betrays the infection’s advance. CUT TO: EXT. SCIENCE CITY PARK - DAYBREAK The park, once a refuge of mirth, now stands ominously silent. A CHILD’S BIKE lies discarded on its side, the nearby swings creaking in the wind as if mourning the loss of laughter. A distant, guttural SCREAM pierces the morning air. Behind a line of trees, a FIGURE stumbles through the underbrush — not a jogger, but something distorted and terrifying. CUT TO: INT.

MARIA stands beside him, her hand finding his. Together they face the beginning of an apocalypse, their world irrevocably changed. MARIA (sound of steel in her voice) Let’s find that antidote, Ed. We owe it to everyone out there—and to ourselves. ED nods, the silence between them speaking volumes. They have become soldiers on the front line of a battle they never wanted. FADE TO: EXT. CITY - CONTINUOUS The morning sun does little to dispel the gloom that envelops the city.

GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURITY ROOM - DAY A flickering glow from multiple monitors lights the dim room. Ed and Maria, alongside their colleague DR. STEVENS, watch in horror as security footage replays the genesis of the calamity. The rat, previously lifeless on a metal table, convulses violently, its death-like stillness erupting into a grisly semblance of life. The creature’s rebirth is captured in grainy detail—a grotesque interruption in the sanitarium of science. DR. STEVENS (voice cracking) Look at it… nobody could have predicted this. It’s like a nightmare. ED (tight-jawed) We created a monster… Maria’s hand covers her mouth as she stifles a sob. The knowledge that their breakthrough is responsible for the terror gripping the city is an unbearable burden. MARIA (overwhelmed) Our children… are they… DR. STEVENS (interrupting, grim) I’ve been trying to reach the schools all morning. Communications are down city-wide. We don’t know who’s… who’s still alive. Ed slams a fist on the console in frustration, his rage a silent scream challenging the chaos. Maria turns to him, eyes pooling with tears—desperation etched on her face. MARIA (pleading) We have to do something, Ed! ED (resolute) And we will. We fix this. We find the cure and distribute it. No rest until this damn virus is eradicated from every last soul it’s touched. They stand united, a feeble bulwark against an abyss that threatens to consume the world they know. CUT TO: EXT. CITY - WIDE SHOT - DAY The camera pans over the once-bustling metropolis, now a ghost town. Silence hangs heavy, broken only by the occasional moan of the wandering undead or the distant cry of the still-living, hiding in the ruins. CUT TO: INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - RESEARCH WING - CONTINUOUS Ed and Maria, passing debris of their shattered ambitions, make their way to the sealed vault which houses their only hope—a cure. Dr. Stevens trails, clutching at his lab coat as if it were a lifeline. ED (urgent) Quickly, this way! They race down the hallway, their every step a deafening echo against the sterile walls. FADE OUT. END OF PAGE 27 OF 150 The tension ramps up as the narrative establishes the complete breakdown of normalcy, with Ed and Maria learning the depth of the catastrophe. Guilt, responsibility, and the pressure to fix their unintended outcome drive them. As they rally themselves to confront the horror their breakthrough has begotten, the story arcs towards an uncertain future with a diminishing glimmer of hope. [This page develops the central characters’ response to the crisis, grounding their scientific pursuits in the harsh light of reality. It is imperative that the story maintains its humanity among the chaos, providing viewers an anchor within the protagonists they can root for.

GENEsis LABORATORY - CORRIDOR - DAY The warning lights flash sporadically, casting an unsettling red glow. The silence is deafening, as ED and MARIA cautiously navigate the wreckage-strewn corridor. ED’s gaze is fixated ahead, a steely resolve masking the dread within. Every shadow is a potential threat, every sound a harbinger of the undead. Suddenly, a guttural growl pierces the silence. Around the corner lumbers a group of zombies, their movements jerky and erratic. The sight is jarring, the realization of their nightmare fully manifest. MARIA (in a hushed tone) Ed… Without hesitation, ED takes the lead, signaling MARIA to stay behind him. Despite his scientific mind rebelling against the logic of their existence, his survival instincts kick in. They back away slowly, but the zombies advance with increasing hunger. The corridor’s confines amplify their mangled cries. Ed and Maria turn to run, but the creatures are relentless in pursuit. One of the zombies lunges forward, catching ED by the arm. Its teeth sink into his flesh—a searing pain that echoes with the unbearable finality of his fate. MARIA (screaming) Ed! She pulls Ed away with a strength born of desperation, dragging him toward a nearby reinforced door. They stumble through just in time, slamming it shut on their assailants. INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE ROOM - CONTINUOUS The couple slumps against the door, breathing heavily. Ed grunts as he clutches the wound, blood oozing between his fingers—a cruel testament to their perilous situation. MARIA (tearfully) It’s not deep, we can treat it. ED (panting, pain-ridden) Maria… I don’t have much time… MARIA (shaking her head) Don’t say that. We’ll find the antidote. We’ll… Ed gives a pained smile, his eyes reflecting both love and sorrow. ED (urgently) Listen to me. You need to continue without me. Find the cure, Maria. MARIA collapses beside him, the horror of the moment washing over her. The reality they tried to escape has consumed them, as the weight of their predicament settles like a shroud. FADE OUT. END OF PAGE 28 OF 150 This emotional scene vividly depicts the first direct confrontation with zombies for Ed and Maria. Tension builds as the horror of Ed’s bite complicates their already desperate quest for the cure. This pivotal moment of sacrifice underscores the stakes of their mission, and the gravity of their journey ahead is elevated—compounded by the personal tragedy they now face. The narrative primes the audience for a story of love, loss, and redemption, intertwining the personal with the broader fight for survival.

GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE RESEARCH FACILITY - DAY The room buzzes with the subdued whirr of high-tech machinery. MARIA scrambles, her hands fumbling through vials and medical supplies, searching for anything that might save ED. He lies on a cot, his complexion growing paler, his breaths shallow. MARIA’s hands shake as she uncaps a vial labeled “Prototype Antidote 7A.” Desperation fills her eyes as she fills a syringe and turns to ED with steely determination. MARIA (breathlessly) Ed, this is experimental, but it’s based on our earlier research. It could save you. ED (weakly, but with a firm resolve) Do it… anything for a chance. Maria injects the contents into his arm. They wait, the seconds stretching into an eternity. Suddenly, Ed convulses, a guttural groan escaping his lips as his body reacts to the drug. MARIA (frantic) Hold on, Ed! Hold on! His convulsions slow, then stop. Slowly, his breathing steadies, and the color begins to return to his cheeks. Maria sighs with relief as she watches him, her own body sagging with exhaustion. ED (voice stronger) Maria… it’s working. I can feel it fighting the virus. MARIA collapses beside him, tears of relief streaming down her face. They embrace, a moment of hope amidst the terror that surrounds them. Suddenly, the door bursts open, ZOMBIES spill into the room, their groans filling the air with dread. With a surge of adrenaline, MARIA springs to her feet, seizing a nearby fire extinguisher. She sprays the advancing horde, her other hand grabbing Ed, pulling him towards an emergency exit. ED (urgently) Go, Maria! Get out of here! MARIA shakes her head, determination blazing in her eyes. MARIA (screaming) Not without you, Ed! Just as they reach the door, a ZOMBIE lunges, its teeth bared for Maria’s neck. In a split-second decision, Ed shoves her through the door, slamming it behind her, locking himself inside with the undead. MARIA (desperately pounding the door) ED! No! But Ed’s fate is sealed. As Maria sobs, slumped against the door, the sounds of the scuffle inside fade. A profound silence settles, and a new resolve takes hold. MARIA (vow in her voice) I’ll make it right, Ed. I’ll save them all. CUT TO: EXT. GENEsis LABORATORY - ROOFTOP HELIPAD - CONTINUOUS A helicopter approaches, the wind from its blades scattering papers and debris across the rooftop. MARIA’s figure emerges from the door to the helipad, her face a mask of anguish turned to determination. The fight for a cure, for redemption, for Ed’s sacrifice, continues. FADE OUT. END OF PAGE 29 OF 150 The screenplay scene bolsters the narrative tension, demonstrating the dire consequences of the outbreak’s spread. Maria’s quick thinking offers a glimmer of hope, but a tragic turn solidifies the high stakes of their mission. This is a pivotal moment, emphasizing both the emotional depth of the characters and the unfolding terror they face, setting the stage for Maria’s relentless pursuit. [This narrative intensifies the plot, delving into the heart-wrenching choices faced by the protagonists. It compellingly intertwines action and emotional heft, immersing the audience in the high-stakes drama of the unfolding zombie apocalypse.

GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE RESEARCH FACILITY - DAY The sterile corridor is now a cacophony of terror. MARIA bears witness to ED’S transformation—skin deathly pale, veins blackening. With the shadow of zombification drawing near, he makes a drastic choice. ED (determined, to Maria) Go! Save our children… save everyone. With a mix of horror and fierce resolve, ED flings himself through the window, landing on the concrete below with an unnatural ferocity only the infected possess. Maria watches as Ed, now imbued with the strength and resilience of the undead but mercifully retaining his mind, staggers to his feet and storms into the city. CUT TO: EXT. CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS With the mind of a scientist but the body of a monster, ED trudges through the chaotic streets, an insatiable need to protect and a relentless drive to find their children fuelling his every step. MARIA, atop the helipad, is torn between following ED and escaping with the cure. Tears stream down her face as she calls out to him, though he can no longer hear her. MARIA (screaming into the void) I love you… I’ll find them, I promise! With the cries of her husband echoing in her ears, Maria vows to carry on their fight and save the city they love. She watches Ed disappear into the horde of zombies, a lone figure of tragedy amidst the devastation. The helicopter, hovering anxiously, becomes her only refuge. She climbs aboard, clutching the potential cure to her chest as they ascend into the maelstrom. CUT TO BLACK. INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE RESEARCH FACILITY - DAY Forcing herself to focus, Maria enters the lab again. The screen flickers to life, interfacing with her fierce intellect. She synthesizes, refines, and tests with the tenacity of a woman reborn from the ashes of her old life. MARIA (whispering to herself) For Ed, for our children… for everyone. Her hands never waver, her eyes never stray. The readouts wink back at her with promising data, and the compound finally takes form—a vial shining with the hope of humanity. MARIA (declaration of war on the apocalypse) This is only the beginning. Run zombie, run. END OF PAGE 30 OF 150 PAGE 31 OF 150 EXT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - MORNING ED KAYNES, his body a mismatch of human fear and zombified resilience, slips through the shattered gates of what was once a sanctuary of learning. A tattered scarf partially conceals his grotesque features, signs of his incomplete transformation into the undead. Silently, he navigates the overgrown courtyard, each step deliberate to avoid drawing attention. Windows, dark and soulless, gape open like the eyes of the dead—witnesses to the devastation within. CUT TO: INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS Ed’s entry is a mirror to his internal chaos—a man, formerly a herald of progress, now reduced to a creature of instinct and desperation. His gait, once confident, is now a sober march into the unknown. He tiptoes past classrooms where silent echoes of children’s laughter are replaced by the somber reality of abandonment. Broken furniture and scattered papers litter the floor—a flashback to the day when life unraveled. A weak groan echoes down the hall as Ed pauses, a sideways glance revealing a lone zombie staggering between the desks of what used to be a third-grade classroom. Ed suppresses a shudder, steeling himself against the macabre scenery. He scans the empty, desolate rooms, searching for any sign of his children—backpacks, a stray drawing, a forgotten toy—anything that would offer a shred of hope. But the silence is the only answer. CUT TO: INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS Ed arrives at the gym, a cavernous hollow now home to dust and despair. Sunlight streams through broken skylights, carving shadows that pool like blood on the hardwood floor. He scans the rafters, a haunting tableau of memories and lost days playing out in the sunbeams. As real as the danger is, it’s the threat of finding irrevocable truth that tightens his chest—a father’s fear, potent even in undeath. But there’s no trace, no joyous clamor of children, no after-school exclamations. They’re gone, swept away by the cataclysm that swept through their lives like a malevolent tide. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS Ed emerges from the school, the line between man and zombie blurred by his faltering, heart-wrenching mission. Desolation repels hope like opposite poles of a tragic magnet. Torn by failure, Ed turns away from the forlorn landmark of his children’s laughter, now a crypt to his unspoken fear. His eyes, rimmed with the red of grief and infection, look beyond—towards the distant, fortified silhouette of his bunker. MONTAGE – ED’S JOURNEY TO THE BUNKER: - Ed’s shadow stretches along the cracked pavement as he trudges through the eerie streets, a spectral figure moving against the grain of desolation. - At intersections, he ducks into the shadows, avoiding the roving packs of zombies that cluster around the remnants of life—imperfect kin he no longer resembles. - The bunker’s hidden entrance, a sliver between the ruins, beckons—a sanctuary amid a city usurped by death. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS A blast door seals with an echo, enveloping Ed in the silence of his clandestine refuge. He peels away the scarf, revealing the visage of a man ensnared between two realities. Amid the quiet hum of survival equipment, Ed perches on the edge of a cot, hands clasped, elbows resting on his knees. He is the epitome of the isolated soul—lost in the chasm between the living and the not. Remnants of humanity nest in the bunker—photographs, clothes, a child’s crayon drawing affixed to a wall. Through the stillness, Ed’s rasping breath is a dissonant chorus, filling the void with his internal war. ED (muttering to himself) I’ll find them—alive or… I must. He rises, a gaunt figure against the backdrop of monitors flickering with disconnected surveillance feeds. With grim acceptance, he begins to arm himself for the world above, the haven below now a grave to his former self. END OF PAGE 31 OF 150 PAGE 32 OF 15 INT. ED’S BUNKER - WASHROOM - CONTINUOUS Ed stands, a tragic figure, before the worn mirror; his flesh sags and his eyes are pools of dread. Clusters of hair slip through his trembling fingers, each strand a part of his old self, relinquishing to the monster he is becoming. A gasp of despair chokes out as he beholds the naked scalp in the mirror, a stark declaration of his metamorphosis. Tears well up, spilling over, tracing grimy paths down his deformed cheeks. The bunker trembles, a distant cataclysm making the very earth weep. A shelf rattles and the few personal effects he’s salvaged from his previous life threaten to tumble and shatter. ED (Screaming, his voice a ragged echo of rage and fear) NOOOOO! NO!..NO! Overcome with grief, he slams a fist against the mirror, the crack spider-webbing across his fractured reflection. His knees buckle, and he sinks to the ground amidst the fallen hair—an island of agony in a sea of cold tile. His wails fill the cramped space, a chilling symphony to a soul in mourning. And in this moment of anguish, the bunker shakes—dust falling like ancient witnesses to his pain. Shelves rattle, threatening to topple, the explosion’s distant thunder a cruel reminder of the world falling apart above. Ed’s cries meld with the deep, seismic vibrations from outside, both the internal and external worlds crumbling in unison. In this fortress of solitude, his tether to sanity and solidarity grows dangerously thin. CUT TO: EXT.

CITY COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS OPERATORS switch between feeds, each scene more chaotic than the last—a city under the shadow of catastrophic failure. The COMMANDER grabs the microphone, urgency tensing his voice. COMMANDER (into microphone) All units, brace for potential aftershocks. We have confirmation of detonation. This is not a drill. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS ED reels from the shockwave, his once stoic facade crumbling. The instruments and gauges surrounding him now mere spectators to his unraveling. ED (hoarse shout) What have we done?! He wrenches away from the mirror, stumbling as the ground continues to betray him. A shelf crashes down, its contents—a journal, a photo, remnants of the past—spill across the floor, a poignant reminder of life before the fall. CUT TO: EXT. CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS The aftermath of the explosion erupts into a chaotic torrent of action—civilian and military alike now share only the common goal of survival. AND CUT BACK TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS ED lunges for a two-way radio, the last line connecting him to the world he fought to save—a world that might no longer exist. His hand caresses the tuning knob, static filling the clean space of the bunker. His voice, modulated by desperation and the unearthly timbre of his new form, crackles into the void. ED (into the radio, desperate) Is anyone out there…? Children… Please… As the static answers back, heavy and relentless, the camera captures a final shot of ED—an echo of humanity caught in the purgatory between life and death. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 32 OF 150 PAGE 33 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The siren’s wail pierces the bunker’s thick silence, a banshee scream announcing impending doom. ED snaps his head towards the crescendo of alarms, as the room is bathed in the urgent glow of red emergency lights.

BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS ED stands frozen, the epitome of desperation, as the last fragments of his world descend into chaos. He watches, powerless, as the skeletal outlines of his former life flicker on the screens. NEWS ANCHOR (ON MONITOR) (tense, authoritative) This is not a drill. Seek immediate shelter. A nuclear strike has been authorized and will commence within the hour. May God have mercy on us all. Ed’s eyes widen with horror at the anchor’s solemn decree. His fist clenches, shattering the radio’s silence. ED (into the radio, voice quivering) Not like this… Please, no… CUT TO: INT. SHELTER - DAY Families huddled together, their eyes glued to portable televisions broadcasting the final countdown. Tears mix with prayers, as they embrace for what could be the last time. CUT TO: INT. MILITARY WAR ROOM - DAY Amidst a flurry of activity, GENERALS and OFFICERS coordinate efforts to mitigate the disaster.

ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS With the siren’s song as his grim chorus, Ed scrambles to secure his sanctuary, locking down hatches and reinforcing the entry. Every clank and hiss a harrowing step towards the inevitable. The camera follows his frantic actions, an intimate dance between man and machine, before pausing on his face—a visage caught between primal survival and heart-wrenching grief. ED (whispering to himself) Survive. Survive for what’s left… The bunker’s artificial lights flicker under the strain of the external world crumbling. Ed, a sentinel at the end of days, stares down the immensity of his solitude, the gravity of the moment heavy upon him. His raspy breath is the metronome to the ticking countdown, as the monitors’ once steadfast streams stutter—a digital heart rate faltering as the world prepares for its last beat. END OF PAGE 33 OF 150 PAGE 34 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The stubborn hum of outdated technology fills the air as ED hunches over the mainframe terminal of the bunker, his fingers a flurry over the backlit keys. The screen before him flashes with layers of security access prompts and firewalls, a digital labyrinth of his own design. Ed’s mind, a cocktail of desperation and scientific prowess, races to unlock the secrets he once safeguarded so fervently. With each override command, he peels back the digital veils shrouding his research, his city’s downfall, the truth. With a final keystroke, he breaches the mainframe security. The floodgates open, and data streams onto the monitor—classified communications, military intel, the command chain’s last orders, the enormity of the impending strike. ED (voice barely a whisper, laced with dread) Oh, what have we done… The screen maps out the grim reality—a schematized web showing the approaching missile’s trajectory, projected fallout patterns, and the bleakest scenarios outlined in stark numeric certainty. CUT TO: INT. MILITARY COMMAND BUNKER - DAY Generals hunch over radar screens, the forewarned cataclysm reflected in their stoic faces. Behind them, a wall-sized world map blinks with the Morse code of impending doom. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed’s horrified gaze traverses the information on-screen. His infected constitution wrestles with the gravity of what’s coming—ignited not by a zombie’s viral urges but by a man’s conscience and heart. ED (grappling with the scope of the cataclysm) There’s gotta be… there must be something else we can do… Anyone… He scans the screens for any sign of hope, a ceasefire, an alternative to the end. But the truth is unyielding, encoded in the logic of machines and strategic calculations. CUT TO: EXT. OBSERVATION POST - DAY A lone soldier stands sentinel, binoculars to his eyes, the distant whistle of the incoming missile harmonizing with the wail of the air raid sirens—a requiem for the world he knew. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed slams his palm against the terminal, the pain insignificant against his racing thoughts. Bitter laughter, a guttural sound devoid of humor, escapes him as he contemplates the irony—the mad scientist, the living dead, now the audience to Armageddon. ED (to himself, the laugh collapsing into a growl) We played with life and death… and now we pay the price. He rises, each movement a struggle as he opens a secure drawer, retrieving a dusty bottle of whiskey, a relic from a past life. He unscrews the cap and takes a swig, the burn a fleeting reminder of human sensations. Ed’s bloodshot eyes, tinged with yellow, fix on the countdown—a digital grim reaper ticking away the seconds of existence. FADE OUT: END OF PAGE 34 OF 150 PAGE 35 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker, once a bastion of safety, becomes a tomb as the hollow echoes of explosions reverberate through its concrete walls. ED stands still, the ghastly light of the monitors painting his face as each distant blast grows closer, louder, a chorus of annihilation gaining fervor. He grips the edge of a console, knuckles white, each rumble a hammer strike against the shield of isolation he’s erected around himself. The shockwaves travel through the floor, a tremor through the heart of the earth. CUT TO: EXT.

The ventilation system churns violently, fighting against the onslaught of the inferno waiting outside. Each detonation outside is a gut punch to the facility, the sound magnified by the silence it disrupts. Flickering screens cast erratic shadows across the walls, creating an ominous dance of light that foreshadows the end. ED (voice choked with dread) This is how it ends… Not with a whimper, but with a bang. CUT TO: INT. FAMILY SHELTER - CONTINUOUS A FAMILY huddles together, their embrace a fortress within the shuddering bunker. Children clutch their parents, eyes wide and uncomprehending, as the reverberations of the unthinkable shake their sanctuary. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS Ed slumps into his seat, resigned, the bottle slipping from his grip and rolling across the floor. The world outside may be ending, but his torment continues unabated—a curse of the undead. A single tear—unclear if it’s from sorrow or the zombie affliction—trails down his face. He watches the countdown dwindle; humanity’s tenure ticking away before his crypt-colored eyes. FADE OUT: END OF PAGE 35 OF 150 PAGE 36 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker convulses as if gripped by an unseen giant, the roar of the impact wave a deafening crescendo punctuating the still air. ED is launched from his chair, thrown to the unforgiving floor as the earth itself seems to spiral into chaos. Around him, the walls tremble, panels and ceiling tiles clattering down in a discordant symphony of destruction. The monitors blink erratically, skewing the horrific show they present—something between reality and electronic hallucination. CUT TO: EXT.

The once orderly rows of canned goods and emergency provisions cascade onto the now-tilting floors. B. Water pipes burst, geysers erupting in formerly dry rooms, while electrical sparks create a dangerous light show. C. A portrait of Ed’s family, clinging to the wall, now slips free and crashes to the ground, the glass protecting their smiles shattering. BACK TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed, crawling through the mayhem, reaches for the bunker’s emergency protocols—a last-ditch hope to seal away the cataclysm that hunts for him within his sanctuary. Lights flicker overhead, many winking out, as the integrity of their fixtures fail. He hits the master lockdown button, and with a metallic groan, reinforced doors slide shut, drowning the chaos into muffled fury. The sanctuary becomes sarcophagus. Over the din of destruction, Ed’s distorted cry resonates—half man, half beast, all despair. ED (screaming above the noise) Survive! I must… survive… The camera pulls out from the scene, leaving Ed a solitary, writhing figure amidst the anarchy that ensnares him—an amalgam of man’s hubris and the savage grip of nature’s retribution, locked in a bunker, locked in turmoil. FADE OUT: END OF PAGE 36 OF 150 PAGE 37 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Amidst the chaos and the runaway dance of shadows and light, ED struggles against the unforgiving floor that refuses to stay still beneath him. His limbs, misshapen by his condition and shaken by the concussive forces, push against the tiles with a strength born from the darkest depths of survival instinct. Grit and dust cake his flesh as he labors for breath, a horrifying rasp that competes with the bunker’s groans and the distant, thunderous booms that refuse to fade away. Pain lances through him; whether from the fall, the shockwaves, or his own internal transformation, it’s impossible to tell. But it fuels him, drives him—the agony a reminder of life amidst a landscape that speaks only of annihilation. CUT TO: EXT. CITY RUINS - SAME MOMENT A cloud of dust and debris blankets the horizon where the city once teemed with life. The singular fury of the initial blast has given birth to countless offspring—sporadic eruptions that devour the remnants of a world now confined to memory and echoes. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed gasps, his body hauled up to an unsteady crouch, fingertips white-knuckled as they grip a shattered piece of the console for support. Desperation swims in his eyes—a cocktail of torment, the will to endure, the knowledge that to succumb now is to surrender to the void. He scans the room through the haze, sees the sealed blast doors, the blinking red of systems barely clinging to function. In this stolen pause, where death seems to have drawn in a breath, Ed finds a semblance of order amidst the tumult. ED (voice a raspy whisper tinged with determination) Not yet… Not today… Tremors wrack his form, but they cannot break the spirit that fuels his battered frame. This bunker, this grave, this womb—it will not be his terminus. With a shake of his head, Ed stands fully, a testament to defiance. His cries subside to murmurs, to mantras of survival that carry him forward—a symphony played against the thunderous backdrop of the world’s end. FADE TO BLACK: END OF PAGE 37 OF 150 PAGE 38 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker’s foundation rattles under the relentless assault, dust cascading like tiny waterfalls from the ceiling. ED, half-zombie, stands amidst a glistening coat of sweat and grime, swaying unevenly as the earth beneath him convulses. He fixates on the emergency lighting, its flickering a spasmodic dirge to the rhythm of apocalypse, his mind racing with primal urgency. Every painful breath is a struggle, drowning in a sea of helplessness and confusion. His flesh, marked both by the zest of the undead and the scars of scientific torment, stretches over his hands as if trying to flee from the bone. His ashen lips mutter a garbled prayer to loved ones lost to either fate or the flame. Ed staggers forward, a mote of dust in the grim tableau of his sanctuary. He salvages a heavy crowbar from the scattered arsenal of survival tools. Its heft gives him a grotesque sense of purpose—a weapon against the barriers that cage him. Footsteps echo with thunderous intent, resonating upon the metal floor, as he assumes the stance of one prepared to battle titans. With a grunt, he wedges the crowbar into the seams of a heavy looking hatch, muscles and sinews bulging in grotesque relief against his lab coat. The strain reddens his eyes, fueling veins with an unnerving fervor. Gritted teeth are bared, the intonation of pained struggle filling the space, as he channels every ounce of his monstrous strength into the task. The metal groans, protesting, as if the very bunker itself is aware of Ed’s unwinnable war against time. With each incremental victory of leverage, the raw scrape of crowbar against hatch is a requiem for reason, a siren call of the myriad dead and dying above. ED (straining, a whisper to himself) Survive, protect, endure… No matter the cost. A sudden lurch, and the hatch gives way, surrendering to Ed’s determination with a scream of yielding steel. A dim shaft of light, alien in the confines of the bunker, pierces the grimy air—a fragile thread leading back to the chaos of a once familiar world. Ed, panting, a line of blood trickling from where the crowbar had slipped, rights himself—a ghastly architect of his own salvation or doom, straddling two realms he never wished to know. The bunker stands defiant, its heart now exposed. And as the camera zooms out, Ed, the anomaly, reaches toward the beckoning light—a specter grappling with the very essence of existence and annihilation. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 38 OF 150 PAGE 39 OF 150 EXT. CITYSCAPE - DAY From the depths of the bunker, ED emerges into a world transformed beyond recognition. A vast wasteland of destruction stretches before him, the cityscape now a twisted shadow of its former self. The ground, littered with debris and the remnants of buildings, challenges every step. Yet Ed advances, his silhouette a stark contrast against the backdrop of a demolished city. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Back inside the shaking bunker, Ed’s hands move with purpose, fueled by an unyielding instinct for survival and protection. He scans the room, now a collapsed chamber of his former life, searching for anything that will aid his escape. He spots his toolbox, hurled by the tremors to a corner. Within lies a collection of tools, each associated with a memory of maintenance and preparedness, each now essential for a far grimmer purpose. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED STREET - CONTINUOUS Ed navigates the treacherous terrain. He grips a robust pipe wrench, repurposed now as a cudgel to fend off the encroaching undead and clear his path of obstacles. His movements are mechanical, devoid of the finesse of the living but driven by a persistent will that seems almost alien in these ruins. Each swing of the wrench is a statement of defiance, a claim to life in a realm of death. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS Ed approaches a mound of rubble where a building once stood. Determination etches his features as he sets about methodically removing pieces of concrete and twisted metal. With each thrust and pry of his makeshift tools, he paves a way through the destruction. His movements are heavy but precise, the products of a mind that refuses to surrender to defeat. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED OVERPASS - CONTINUOUS Ahead lies the skeletal remains of what was once a vital overpass, its concrete bones a grim parody of the city’s past prosperity. Ed braces himself and climbs, his upheaved hands finding cracks and purchase among the debris. His progress is slow and arduous, but the sight of the overpass’s peak, a symbol of hope, spurs him onward. CUT TO: EXT. CITYSCAPE - HIGH ANGLE - CONTINUOUS Ed reaches the summit of the overpass and pauses, his gaze sweeping over the horizon. The wreckage stretches as far as the eye can see, but this height gives perspective—there is a path to be forged, a direction to take. He takes a deep breath, the air a mingled scent of dust and destruction, and raises his wrench high. It’s a gesture of both challenge and resolve, a signal that his journey through this nightmare has only just begun. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 39 OF 150 PAGE 40 OF 150 EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - DAY ED’s lone figure is dwarfed by the gaping wound of the city. His every step is a testament to his unshakable resolve. The wrench, now an extension of his will, pierces the rubble blocking his path. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSED SUBWAY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS Ed approaches the maw of a collapsed subway entrance. Sunlight pierces through the cracks, casting slivers of light that dance on the mangled steel and broken tiles. With each piece of debris he removes, the way forward becomes clearer. He works in silence, his breaths and the sound of falling concrete the only interruptions in the deathly quiet. CUT TO: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS The darkness of the tunnel envelops Ed as he descends. The beam from his makeshift torch, fashioned from a rag and salvaged alcohol, flickers against the walls, throwing exaggerated shadows around him. He navigates the shattered remains of the underground with a mixture of zombie-like indifference and human caution, the two natures merged into one being, surviving by instinct and intellect. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS Ed emerges onto the cracked surface of a highway, once a vein pulsing with life, now a silent artery in a dead metropolis. He takes a moment to scan the expanse for movement, for any sign of those like him or worse. Empty cars stand as monuments to a sudden catastrophe, their doors agape, their stories untold. CUT TO: INT. CRUSHED CAR - CONTINUOUS Ed peers through the window of a half-collapsed vehicle. Inside, a skeleton grips the steering wheel, a stark reminder of society’s abrupt end. For a moment, Ed sees himself—not so different from the bones. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - OVERLOOK - CONTINUOUS Climbing atop a pile of rubble that offers a vantage point, Ed scans the horizon. His heart, whatever is left of it, aches. The city lies in ruins, but amidst the desolation, there is a faint echo of hope—a whisper of life. CUT TO: EXT. NARROW CREVICE BETWEEN BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS Ed finds a narrow passageway, wedged between two faltering skyscrapers. The space is tight, claustrophobic, but the fresh air beckoning from the other side is unmistakable—a breath of the world beyond. He squeezes through the gap, the walls scraping against his flesh, now so foreign to pain. As he emerges, the air hits him like a wave of the past. It’s tinged with the acrid scent of smoke and decay, yet underneath it all is the undeniable smell of survival. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - CONTINUOUS Ed stands at the threshold of the crevice, the firmament open before him. He takes a long, deep breath, feeling the air churn within his lungs—half-life, half-death. A resolve settles deep within his marrow. He steps forward, leaving the shadows behind. Ahead, the path is fraught with ruin and remembrance, but it is his to tread. With the wrench slung over his shoulder, Ed sets out into the sunlit devastation, a figure of determination silhouetted against the crumbling silhouette of a fallen world. FADE OUT.

MARIA (smiling, holding up a glass) And to the future we’re building—not just for us, but for everyone. As laughter bubbles from the building, colleagues gather around, joining in celebration. CLINKING glasses echo, signaling the end of a day filled with promise. CUT TO: INT. ED AND MARIA’S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT The laughter fades, replaced by the QUIET crackle of a fireplace. ED and MARIA sit close, their conversation INTIMATE and LOW. MARIA (whispering, with warmth) This discovery… It’s going to change everything, Ed. Are we ready?

CONFERENCE HALL - DAY The hum of anticipation among the assembled academics and press fades as EDWARD “ED” KAYNES steps up to the podium with the calm assurance of a man about to unveil a marvel. All eyes are fixed on him, sensing the cusp of a scientific revelation. ED (acknowledging the crowd with a nod) Today, we stand on the threshold of a new era. I am thrilled to present a breakthrough that not only defies the aging process but redefines the contours of life as we know it. As he gestures to the stage, the curtains part, revealing a VIVACIOUS WHITE RAT behind the glass—its healthy demeanor belying its actual age. The crowd murmurs in astonishment, their skepticism giving way to wonder. AT THE BACK, MARIA watches, her pride in their shared labor unmistakable. When their eyes meet, the silent acknowledgment of their journey thus far sparks a knowing smile between them. MARIA (to a COLLEAGUE, her voice a blend of pride and excitement) This is it—the dawn of enduring vitality. This is our beginning! The audience’s applause crescendos into a standing ovation—a tribute to the promise laid bare on the stage. Cameras flash, capturing ED, who stands before them—a pioneer heralding the cusp of immortality. ED (amplified by the room’s acoustics) Your applause is the heartbeat of progress. This, my friends, is not solely an academic triumph; this is humanity’s victory over time’s decay. Even amidst the sea of attendees, the bond between ED and MARIA is unmissable—a union of intellect and ambition. Their shared accomplishment is a silent vow to continue pushing the boundaries of possibility. As the roar of clapping hands slowly ebbs into a current of animated discussions and queries, MARIA winds her way through the crowd, gravitating back to ED’s side.

ED AND MARIA’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT A sense of warmth suffuses the space as Ed and Maria return to the comfort of their home. The quiet hum of a city at rest forms a subtle undertone to the scene. Restlessness yields to relief as they share a moment of reprieve. In this sanctum, the day’s triumph feels immediate and personal. It’s a respite from the world of laboratories and scientific accolades—a chance to revel in an accomplishment all their own. Ed, tension easing from his shoulders, appreciatively surveys the room—each surface bearing the mark of their shared life and successes. MARIA (teasing, offering a glass) To the future—may it be as bright as your most optimistic hypothesis. ED (accepting the glass, playful smirk) It’s proven science now, no longer just a hypothesis. They toast, glasses chiming softly, and sink into the familiar embrace of their couch—a stark contrast to the antiseptic confines of the lab. Contentment settles around them, a comforting blanket ensuring the world’s weight can wait a little longer. Maria tilts her head, capturing Ed’s gaze with an affectionate look. MARIA (sincere) You know, this breakthrough, it’s not just ours—it’s humanity’s. But tonight, let’s just be Ed and Maria, not scientists, not pioneers. Just… us. Ed nods, grateful for the solitude and sanctuary of their bond. As they clink glasses, the collected memorabilia of their careers—the articles, letters, awards—are merely shadows to the reality of them, here and now, together. Their laughter fades as they draw close, the rest of the evening dedicated to a celebration for two. Every lingering touch and shared smile is a world apart from their public personas—a declaration of love in a quiet act of rebellion against the pace of their lives. A soft melody drifts, an analog record player spinning a tune that seems composed for moments such as this. Ed and Maria rise, joining in an intimate dance—a slow, gentle sway, as if the notes themselves guide their movements. ED (softly, into her hair) Forget the breakthrough, the cure, the fame. You’re the real miracle in my life. Maria responds, her hand clasping tighter to his. MARIA (voice barely above a whisper) And you are my constant, through every success and every unknown. As they linger in the embrace of the dance, the world beyond the curtains continues to turn, unaware of the risk drawn from the very elixir of life they’ve concocted. But for now, for Ed and Maria, time stands still, the storm can wait, and love remains unchallenged. FADE OUT.

ED AND MARIA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT After a day of celebrating their progress, ED and MARIA return to their home's comforting embrace. It's a world away from the sterile lab, a haven where their research accolades can be set aside. They settle onto the couch, wrapped in the tranquility of shared success. MARIA, a gleam of joy in her eyes, holds up two glasses of wine with a playful grace. MARIA To us—to the journey and the dreams waiting to unfold. ED, his smile reflecting a day well-spent, clinks his glass against hers. ED To every discovery that awaits, and to the moments like these, where all that truly matters... is us.

The space is accented with mementos, each a testament to their joint quest in science—but tonight, those achievements take a back seat to the here and now. MARIA suddenly stands, an impish sparkle in her eye. MARIA Dance with me, Ed. He takes her hand, and they begin a slow dance to the soft sound of a nearby record player - an old favorite melody filling the room. Trivialities of fame and science dissolve away as they sway in sync. It's just them against the world, their bond a constant against any storm. ED (whispers as they sway) In this dance, there's only you and me—and that’s more than enough. They continue, wrapped in each other's arms, the record playing their love in vinyl grooves.

In pursuance of the commands that were outlined in the previous paragraph, please write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a concise background (in which the events of the preceding scene leading to the events in the current scene are briefly described, explaining the source of the returning woman's surmounting urge to relieve herself and the reason why she hasn't relieved herself properly by the time she reaches the house), for a very long comedic scene in a Hindi Comedy Drama TV Serial that includes the following sequence of events: * A woman (give her a name, and describe her physical appearance and clothing; she’s an unassuming college student; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt, leggings nor jeans in the scene) is returning home and approaching the door of her family’s house with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped her pants and for how dirty pooping her pants is. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and complaining about how noisome the returning woman is right now. Then, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she had to get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants completely. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the factors that forced the returning woman into such a situation where she poops her pants and that forced her to make such a decision as pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if it was released in her pants, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women prevents the returning woman from leaving for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants when she speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are full of so much poop because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are right now, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing and the pooping provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten complete relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nastily childish and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking, infantilizing physical gesture and verbal ridicule. Then, the present woman proceeds to tauntingly scold the returning woman for being a particularly stinky girl in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman concedes that she is particularly smelly in her present state, and then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in her place, with the poop in her pants, so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"poopy diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while complaining to herself out loud about the returning woman being remarkably smelly from pooping her pants.","completion":"FADE IN: EXT.

Neha responds with sheepish indignation while Mrs. Gupta complains aloud about the odor. MRS. GUPTA (frantically wafting the air) Is umr mein aisa bachpana! Kab badoogi tum? (This childishness at your age! When will you grow up?) NEHA (replies sulkily) Mera galti nahi hai, Ma. Tumne hi toh roka tha. (It’s not my fault, Ma. You stopped me.) Mrs. Gupta vehemently denies the excuse, her voice stern. MRS. GUPTA (scoffing) Koi bahaana nahi ban sakta ye! (This can never be an excuse!) NEHA (insistent) Par mujhe bahut urgent tha, Ma! Nikalna hi pada! (But it was so urgent, Ma! I had to let it out!) As Neha apologetically assesses the bulge, Mrs. Gupta admonishes her. MRS. GUPTA (mocking) Waah, toh ab tumhe ismein bhi mazaa aaya? Gande ladki! (Wow, so you enjoyed this too? Nasty girl!) NEHA (flinging her hand off the bulge, embarrassed) Matlab nahi tha woh, Ma... Chali jaati hoon saaf karne... (That’s not what I meant, Ma... I’ll go clean up...) Mrs. Gupta blocks Neha's path for further scolding. MRS. GUPTA (deeply mortified, inspecting Neha’s back) Dekho kitni gandi ho gayi hai! (Look how dirty you’ve become!) NEHA (coyly) Kya karun, bahut zyaada tha na... (What can I do, there was a lot...) Mrs. Gupta sniffs near Neha's seat, a derisive gesture. MRS. GUPTA (infantalizing ridicule) Haw! Kaise badbu aa rahi hai! Choti bacchi ho kya? (Ew! What a stink! Are you a little child?) NEHA (conceding) Haan, smelly hoon main... Toh thodi der aur ruk jaati hoon, aapki marzi! (Yes, I'm smelly... So, I’ll stay here longer, if you wish!) Mrs. Gupta ushers Neha to the bathroom, still reacting to the smell. MRS. GUPTA (pushing Neha) Chalo, andar jao, aur koi naatak nahi! (Go inside, and no more drama!) Amidst their embroiled exchange, they make their way to the bathroom, Mrs. Gupta continuously complaining. Reaching the bathroom, Neha teases one last time, gesturing toward her pants. NEHA (coyly) Ma, diaper badal do? (Mom, will you change my diaper?) Mrs. Gupta, totally affronted, pushes the bulge, forcing Neha inside the bathroom, her face twisted in mock disgust. MRS. GUPTA (pushing Neha, nose plugged) Haan haan, ab andar jao! (Yes, yes, get inside now!) NEHA (exclaims as she's pushed) Iiiyuck! Sab fail gaya andar! (Iiiyuck! It’s all smeared inside!) Mrs. Gupta closes the door behind Neha, shaking her head. MRS. GUPTA (still holding her nose) Sahi kiya maine... Bas, ab jaldi se saaf ho jaao! (I did the right thing... Just clean up quickly now!) She walks away, muttering. MRS. GUPTA (loudly to herself) Kitni badboo aati hai isse, uff... (Such a bad smell from her, ugh...) FADE OUT.

Полный сюжет фильма \\"RUN ZOMBIE, RUN\\": Акт 1: Введение в мир и персонажей Открытие фильма: • Фильм начинается в мирное время, в современном научном городе, где жизнь кипит и наука бурлит. • Эд – талантливый учёный, занятый исследованиями в области биотехнологий вместе со своей женой и коллегами. Они стоят на пороге прорыва: создания вакцины для вечной жизни и молодости. • Научный отдел в восторге от открытия, в лаборатории царит атмосфера торжества. После успешной презентации их эксперимента над крысами, Эд и его жена возвращаются домой, чтобы отпраздновать успех. Шторм наступает: • Интимные моменты между Эдом и его женой дома. Они обсуждают планы на будущее, их романтическая встреча переходит в страстный вечер. • Когда после утро голые с обьятием жены в постели,и через некоторое время начинают звонить в телефон эда и сообщают что в вашем лаборотории что-то случилось не хорошее. • Радость прерывается известием о трагедии: инфицированная крыса умерла и восстала как зомби, сбежав из лаборатории и начав заражение города. • Пока Эд и его жена отдыхают, город погружается в хаос. Зомби-вирус быстро распространяется, затрагивая школы, больницы, улицы. Трагический перелом: • На следующее утро Эд и его жена возвращаются в лабораторию и обнаруживают сбежавшую крысу. Новости сообщают о массовом заражении. • Они пытаются дозвониться до детей и родственников, но безуспешно. Улицы заполнены зомби.

Ядерный удар: • Эд, полузомби, узнаёт о намерениях властей сбросить на город ядерную бомбу. С помощью своих новых способностей он прячется в подземном бункере. • Бомба стирает город с лица земли, уничтожая всех его обитателей, как живых, так и мёртвых. Акт 2: Развитие сюжета и персонажей Эд выходит на поверхность: • После взрыва Эд, один из немногих выживших, покидает своё убежище. Мир, который он знал, больше не существует. • Он встречает Бена, мальчика-сироту, выжившего в руинах города. Между ними завязывается необычная дружба. Выживание в разрушенном мире: • Эд и Бен ищут припасы и остатки цивилизации, стараясь выжить среди развалин и постоянной угрозы зомби. • По мере их путешествия за руинами, Эд начинает терять остатки своего человечества и борется с внутренними демонами. Акт 3: Кульминация и разрешение конфликта Шоу \\"Rundead\\": • Ханз Шоумастер, выживший продюсер, создаёт телешоу \\"Rundead\\" и похищает Бена, чтобы использовать его в качестве приза для Эда. • Эд, теперь полностью зомби, но сохранивший воспоминания о Бене, проходит через жестокие испытания шоу.

There’s a magnetism between them as he approaches, the shared burdens and triumphs of their work enveloping them like a cloak. The clink of glass and faint laughter from the celebration seep through the walls, a reminder of the world outside. CUT TO: CLOSE-UP - MARIA’S FACE, illuminated by the city lights, her eyes shining with unshed tears. MARIA (voice soft with emotion) We’ve done more than I ever dreamed. Yet tonight, I can’t shake off a sense of foreboding… ED wraps his arms around her waist, drawing her close. Their connection is as palpable as the air they breathe, their union strengthened by the challenges they’ve faced. ED (reassuringly) We’ve tread through the unknown, shaped the future. Any fear we feel is a reminder of our responsibility. They stand in shared silence, their gaze on the sprawling city below—a testament to humanity’s relentless advance. CUT TO: TWO SHOT - ED AND MARIA together, framed against the cityscape. Ed rests his chin on Maria’s shoulder, their reflections woven into the tapestry of lights. ED (softly) What matters now is that we navigate the path ahead with caution. For every miracle we’ve created, there’s a responsibility we can’t ignore. MARIA (turning to face him) Our dreams could become nightmares if we’re not careful. The joy of discovery, the weight of consequence—we carry them both. ED (nodding) Together, we’ll face whatever comes. Our love, our bond… it’s our anchor amidst the storm. They share a tender kiss, a moment of solace away from prying eyes and probing questions. It’s a promise, a vow unspoken but deeply felt—an acknowledgment of their unity and unwavering support for each other.

The car is a vessel adrift in the ocean of an uncertain future, the serenity an unsettling prelude to the sirocco of change. MARIA (softly, almost to herself) What have we done, Ed? The path we’ve chosen… ED (firmly, cutting the tension) …is the right one. Doubt can’t sway us now. We did it for the greater good, regardless of the cost. EXT. ED’S HOUSE - BACK PORCH - NIGHT The two of them, alone against the tapestry of the night sky, settle into a silence under the stars. The darkness is pierced by the soft flicker of candlelight. The porch, a haven in the eye of the storm, is where they find solace. MARIA (a murmur against the night’s whisper) May this peace last, against the tempest that looms. ED gathers MARIA in his arms, a fortress against the coming gale. ED (mutely determined) As long as we stand together, we’ll weather any storm. MARIA leans into ED, her beacon in the twilight. Together, they face the horizon, where dawn’s light contends with the shadows of uncertainty. CUT TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 14 OF 150 PAGE 15 OF 150: INT.

Outside, a tapestry of stars battles the city’s fading luminescence, a visual symphony of light and dark mirrored in the weary yet hopeful eyes of our travelers. MARIA (softly, to Ed, with solemn warmth) The path we’ve carved today will shape a thousand tomorrows, entangling our fates with the arc of history. Their glance meets, a bridge of silence spanning between them, weighted with the burden of their creation. CUT TO: The sanctuary of their home awaits as they drift into the driveway. The car’s engine stills, surrendering to the quietude that wraps around them like a protective shroud.

They are nestled on a luxurious sofa that is the epitome of modern elegance, yet the room resonates with an old-world charm. A low table is the centerpiece of their intimate setup, decorated with a vibrant bouquet and the soft flicker of candlelight. An open bottle of red wine sits idle, exuding its bouquet into the room, while two glasses sit, their contents slowly savored. Maria finds solace in Ed’s embrace, her body drawn to his as they reflect on the day’s triumph and ponder their shared aspirations.

The incessant RINGING of Ed’s phone slices through the silence—insistent, jarring. He stirs, but Maria nudges him towards the persistent invasion of their tranquility. MARIA (muffled against Ed’s neck) Honey… the phone… ED (grumbling) Let it ring… nothing is more important than this moment. But the phone is relentless. After several ignored calls, Ed finally relents. ED (sighing) Alright… alright… He reaches out, voice heavy with the remnants of sleep and satisfaction. ED (into the phone) Hello? The grave voice of a COLLEAGUE reverberates through the line, shattering the mussed warmth of their sanctuary. CUT TO: Split Screen: Ed’s expressions of ecstasy now contort to one of shock and disbelief. COLLEAGUE (V.O.) (urgent, panicked) Ed—it’s gone wrong. The test subject—it… The blood drains from Ed’s face as the screams from the other side sync with lightning strikes outside. Redeployment from a night of union to one of splitting despair. The camera focuses tight on Ed’s widening eyes, as understanding and dread meld into a chilling realization. CUT TO: Maria looks on, her countenance shifting from tranquil contentment to alarmed confusion. MARIA (in a strained whisper) Ed, what’s happened? The storm outside wails as if to answer.

MARIA stands beside him, her hand finding his. Together they face the beginning of an apocalypse, their world irrevocably changed. MARIA (sound of steel in her voice) Let’s find that antidote, Ed. We owe it to everyone out there—and to ourselves. ED nods, the silence between them speaking volumes. They have become soldiers on the front line of a battle they never wanted. FADE TO: EXT. CITY - CONTINUOUS The morning sun does little to dispel the gloom that envelops the city. Citizens wade through the streets, carrying whatever possessions they can, their expressions hollow with shock and grief.

The creature’s rebirth is captured in grainy detail—a grotesque interruption in the sanitarium of science. DR. STEVENS (voice cracking) Look at it… nobody could have predicted this. It’s like a nightmare. ED (tight-jawed) We created a monster… Maria’s hand covers her mouth as she stifles a sob. The knowledge that their breakthrough is responsible for the terror gripping the city is an unbearable burden. MARIA (overwhelmed) Our children… are they… DR. STEVENS (interrupting, grim) I’ve been trying to reach the schools all morning. Communications are down city-wide. We don’t know who’s… who’s still alive. Ed slams a fist on the console in frustration, his rage a silent scream challenging the chaos. Maria turns to him, eyes pooling with tears—desperation etched on her face. MARIA (pleading) We have to do something, Ed! ED (resolute) And we will. We fix this. We find the cure and distribute it. No rest until this damn virus is eradicated from every last soul it’s touched. They stand united, a feeble bulwark against an abyss that threatens to consume the world they know. CUT TO: EXT.

Around the corner lumbers a group of zombies, their movements jerky and erratic. The sight is jarring, the realization of their nightmare fully manifest. MARIA (in a hushed tone) Ed… Without hesitation, ED takes the lead, signaling MARIA to stay behind him. Despite his scientific mind rebelling against the logic of their existence, his survival instincts kick in. They back away slowly, but the zombies advance with increasing hunger. The corridor’s confines amplify their mangled cries. Ed and Maria turn to run, but the creatures are relentless in pursuit. One of the zombies lunges forward, catching ED by the arm. Its teeth sink into his flesh—a searing pain that echoes with the unbearable finality of his fate. MARIA (screaming) Ed!

GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE ROOM - CONTINUOUS The couple slumps against the door, breathing heavily. Ed grunts as he clutches the wound, blood oozing between his fingers—a cruel testament to their perilous situation. MARIA (tearfully) It’s not deep, we can treat it. ED (panting, pain-ridden) Maria… I don’t have much time… MARIA (shaking her head) Don’t say that. We’ll find the antidote. We’ll… Ed gives a pained smile, his eyes reflecting both love and sorrow. ED (urgently) Listen to me. You need to continue without me. Find the cure, Maria. MARIA collapses beside him, the horror of the moment washing over her. The reality they tried to escape has consumed them, as the weight of their predicament settles like a shroud. FADE OUT.

MARIA’s hands shake as she uncaps a vial labeled “Prototype Antidote 7A.” Desperation fills her eyes as she fills a syringe and turns to ED with steely determination. MARIA (breathlessly) Ed, this is experimental, but it’s based on our earlier research. It could save you. ED (weakly, but with a firm resolve) Do it… anything for a chance. Maria injects the contents into his arm. They wait, the seconds stretching into an eternity. Suddenly, Ed convulses, a guttural groan escaping his lips as his body reacts to the drug. MARIA (frantic) Hold on, Ed! Hold on! His convulsions slow, then stop. Slowly, his breathing steadies, and the color begins to return to his cheeks. Maria sighs with relief as she watches him, her own body sagging with exhaustion. ED (voice stronger) Maria… it’s working. I can feel it fighting the virus. MARIA collapses beside him, tears of relief streaming down her face. They embrace, a moment of hope amidst the terror that surrounds them. Suddenly, the door bursts open, ZOMBIES spill into the room, their groans filling the air with dread. With a surge of adrenaline, MARIA springs to her feet, seizing a nearby fire extinguisher. She sprays the advancing horde, her other hand grabbing Ed, pulling him towards an emergency exit. ED (urgently) Go, Maria! Get out of here! MARIA shakes her head, determination blazing in her eyes. MARIA (screaming) Not without you, Ed! Just as they reach the door, a ZOMBIE lunges, its teeth bared for Maria’s neck. In a split-second decision, Ed shoves her through the door, slamming it behind her, locking himself inside with the undead. MARIA (desperately pounding the door) ED! No! But Ed’s fate is sealed. As Maria sobs, slumped against the door, the sounds of the scuffle inside fade. A profound silence settles, and a new resolve takes hold. MARIA (vow in her voice) I’ll make it right, Ed. I’ll save them all. CUT TO: EXT. GENEsis LABORATORY - ROOFTOP HELIPAD - CONTINUOUS A helicopter approaches, the wind from its blades scattering papers and debris across the rooftop.

MARIA (declaration of war on the apocalypse) This is only the beginning. Run zombie, run. END OF PAGE 30 OF 150 PAGE 31 OF 150 EXT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - MORNING ED KAYNES, his body a mismatch of human fear and zombified resilience, slips through the shattered gates of what was once a sanctuary of learning. A tattered scarf partially conceals his grotesque features, signs of his incomplete transformation into the undead. Silently, he navigates the overgrown courtyard, each step deliberate to avoid drawing attention. Windows, dark and soulless, gape open like the eyes of the dead—witnesses to the devastation within. CUT TO: INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS Ed’s entry is a mirror to his internal chaos—a man, formerly a herald of progress, now reduced to a creature of instinct and desperation. His gait, once confident, is now a sober march into the unknown. He tiptoes past classrooms where silent echoes of children’s laughter are replaced by the somber reality of abandonment. Broken furniture and scattered papers litter the floor—a flashback to the day when life unraveled. A weak groan echoes down the hall as Ed pauses, a sideways glance revealing a lone zombie staggering between the desks of what used to be a third-grade classroom. Ed suppresses a shudder, steeling himself against the macabre scenery.

CUT TO: INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS Ed arrives at the gym, a cavernous hollow now home to dust and despair. Sunlight streams through broken skylights, carving shadows that pool like blood on the hardwood floor. He scans the rafters, a haunting tableau of memories and lost days playing out in the sunbeams. As real as the danger is, it’s the threat of finding irrevocable truth that tightens his chest—a father’s fear, potent even in undeath. But there’s no trace, no joyous clamor of children, no after-school exclamations. They’re gone, swept away by the cataclysm that swept through their lives like a malevolent tide. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS Ed emerges from the school, the line between man and zombie blurred by his faltering, heart-wrenching mission. Desolation repels hope like opposite poles of a tragic magnet. Torn by failure, Ed turns away from the forlorn landmark of his children’s laughter, now a crypt to his unspoken fear. His eyes, rimmed with the red of grief and infection, look beyond—towards the distant, fortified silhouette of his bunker. MONTAGE – ED’S JOURNEY TO THE BUNKER: - Ed’s shadow stretches along the cracked pavement as he trudges through the eerie streets, a spectral figure moving against the grain of desolation. - At intersections, he ducks into the shadows, avoiding the roving packs of zombies that cluster around the remnants of life—imperfect kin he no longer resembles. - The bunker’s hidden entrance, a sliver between the ruins, beckons—a sanctuary amid a city usurped by death. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS A blast door seals with an echo, enveloping Ed in the silence of his clandestine refuge. He peels away the scarf, revealing the visage of a man ensnared between two realities. Amid the quiet hum of survival equipment, Ed perches on the edge of a cot, hands clasped, elbows resting on his knees. He is the epitome of the isolated soul—lost in the chasm between the living and the not. Remnants of humanity nest in the bunker—photographs, clothes, a child’s crayon drawing affixed to a wall. Through the stillness, Ed’s rasping breath is a dissonant chorus, filling the void with his internal war. ED (muttering to himself) I’ll find them—alive or… I must. He rises, a gaunt figure against the backdrop of monitors flickering with disconnected surveillance feeds. With grim acceptance, he begins to arm himself for the world above, the haven below now a grave to his former self. END OF PAGE 31 OF 150 PAGE 32 OF 15 INT.

Clusters of hair slip through his trembling fingers, each strand a part of his old self, relinquishing to the monster he is becoming. A gasp of despair chokes out as he beholds the naked scalp in the mirror, a stark declaration of his metamorphosis. Tears well up, spilling over, tracing grimy paths down his deformed cheeks. The bunker trembles, a distant cataclysm making the very earth weep. A shelf rattles and the few personal effects he’s salvaged from his previous life threaten to tumble and shatter. ED (Screaming, his voice a ragged echo of rage and fear) NOOOOO! NO!..NO! Overcome with grief, he slams a fist against the mirror, the crack spider-webbing across his fractured reflection. His knees buckle, and he sinks to the ground amidst the fallen hair—an island of agony in a sea of cold tile. His wails fill the cramped space, a chilling symphony to a soul in mourning. And in this moment of anguish, the bunker shakes—dust falling like ancient witnesses to his pain. Shelves rattle, threatening to topple, the explosion’s distant thunder a cruel reminder of the world falling apart above.

CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS ED reels from the shockwave, his once stoic facade crumbling. The instruments and gauges surrounding him now mere spectators to his unraveling. ED (hoarse shout) What have we done?! He wrenches away from the mirror, stumbling as the ground continues to betray him. A shelf crashes down, its contents—a journal, a photo, remnants of the past—spill across the floor, a poignant reminder of life before the fall. CUT TO: EXT. CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS The aftermath of the explosion erupts into a chaotic torrent of action—civilian and military alike now share only the common goal of survival. AND CUT BACK TO: INT.

His infected constitution wrestles with the gravity of what’s coming—ignited not by a zombie’s viral urges but by a man’s conscience and heart. ED (grappling with the scope of the cataclysm) There’s gotta be… there must be something else we can do… Anyone… He scans the screens for any sign of hope, a ceasefire, an alternative to the end. But the truth is unyielding, encoded in the logic of machines and strategic calculations. CUT TO: EXT.

Bitter laughter, a guttural sound devoid of humor, escapes him as he contemplates the irony—the mad scientist, the living dead, now the audience to Armageddon. ED (to himself, the laugh collapsing into a growl) We played with life and death… and now we pay the price. He rises, each movement a struggle as he opens a secure drawer, retrieving a dusty bottle of whiskey, a relic from a past life. He unscrews the cap and takes a swig, the burn a fleeting reminder of human sensations.

He hits the master lockdown button, and with a metallic groan, reinforced doors slide shut, drowning the chaos into muffled fury. The sanctuary becomes sarcophagus. Over the din of destruction, Ed’s distorted cry resonates—half man, half beast, all despair. ED (screaming above the noise) Survive! I must… survive… The camera pulls out from the scene, leaving Ed a solitary, writhing figure amidst the anarchy that ensnares him—an amalgam of man’s hubris and the savage grip of nature’s retribution, locked in a bunker, locked in turmoil.

Grit and dust cake his flesh as he labors for breath, a horrifying rasp that competes with the bunker’s groans and the distant, thunderous booms that refuse to fade away. Pain lances through him; whether from the fall, the shockwaves, or his own internal transformation, it’s impossible to tell. But it fuels him, drives him—the agony a reminder of life amidst a landscape that speaks only of annihilation. CUT TO: EXT. CITY RUINS - SAME MOMENT A cloud of dust and debris blankets the horizon where the city once teemed with life. The singular fury of the initial blast has given birth to countless offspring—sporadic eruptions that devour the remnants of a world now confined to memory and echoes. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed gasps, his body hauled up to an unsteady crouch, fingertips white-knuckled as they grip a shattered piece of the console for support. Desperation swims in his eyes—a cocktail of torment, the will to endure, the knowledge that to succumb now is to surrender to the void. He scans the room through the haze, sees the sealed blast doors, the blinking red of systems barely clinging to function. In this stolen pause, where death seems to have drawn in a breath, Ed finds a semblance of order amidst the tumult. ED (voice a raspy whisper tinged with determination) Not yet… Not today… Tremors wrack his form, but they cannot break the spirit that fuels his battered frame. This bunker, this grave, this womb—it will not be his terminus. With a shake of his head, Ed stands fully, a testament to defiance. His cries subside to murmurs, to mantras of survival that carry him forward—a symphony played against the thunderous backdrop of the world’s end. FADE TO BLACK: END OF PAGE 37 OF 150 PAGE 38 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker’s foundation rattles under the relentless assault, dust cascading like tiny waterfalls from the ceiling. ED, half-zombie, stands amidst a glistening coat of sweat and grime, swaying unevenly as the earth beneath him convulses. He fixates on the emergency lighting, its flickering a spasmodic dirge to the rhythm of apocalypse, his mind racing with primal urgency. Every painful breath is a struggle, drowning in a sea of helplessness and confusion. His flesh, marked both by the zest of the undead and the scars of scientific torment, stretches over his hands as if trying to flee from the bone. His ashen lips mutter a garbled prayer to loved ones lost to either fate or the flame. Ed staggers forward, a mote of dust in the grim tableau of his sanctuary. He salvages a heavy crowbar from the scattered arsenal of survival tools. Its heft gives him a grotesque sense of purpose—a weapon against the barriers that cage him. Footsteps echo with thunderous intent, resonating upon the metal floor, as he assumes the stance of one prepared to battle titans. With a grunt, he wedges the crowbar into the seams of a heavy looking hatch, muscles and sinews bulging in grotesque relief against his lab coat. The strain reddens his eyes, fueling veins with an unnerving fervor. Gritted teeth are bared, the intonation of pained struggle filling the space, as he channels every ounce of his monstrous strength into the task. The metal groans, protesting, as if the very bunker itself is aware of Ed’s unwinnable war against time. With each incremental victory of leverage, the raw scrape of crowbar against hatch is a requiem for reason, a siren call of the myriad dead and dying above. ED (straining, a whisper to himself) Survive, protect, endure… No matter the cost. A sudden lurch, and the hatch gives way, surrendering to Ed’s determination with a scream of yielding steel. A dim shaft of light, alien in the confines of the bunker, pierces the grimy air—a fragile thread leading back to the chaos of a once familiar world. Ed, panting, a line of blood trickling from where the crowbar had slipped, rights himself—a ghastly architect of his own salvation or doom, straddling two realms he never wished to know. The bunker stands defiant, its heart now exposed. And as the camera zooms out, Ed, the anomaly, reaches toward the beckoning light—a specter grappling with the very essence of existence and annihilation. FADE TO BLACK.

A vast wasteland of destruction stretches before him, the cityscape now a twisted shadow of its former self. The ground, littered with debris and the remnants of buildings, challenges every step. Yet Ed advances, his silhouette a stark contrast against the backdrop of a demolished city. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Back inside the shaking bunker, Ed’s hands move with purpose, fueled by an unyielding instinct for survival and protection. He scans the room, now a collapsed chamber of his former life, searching for anything that will aid his escape. He spots his toolbox, hurled by the tremors to a corner. Within lies a collection of tools, each associated with a memory of maintenance and preparedness, each now essential for a far grimmer purpose. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED STREET - CONTINUOUS Ed navigates the treacherous terrain. He grips a robust pipe wrench, repurposed now as a cudgel to fend off the encroaching undead and clear his path of obstacles. His movements are mechanical, devoid of the finesse of the living but driven by a persistent will that seems almost alien in these ruins. Each swing of the wrench is a statement of defiance, a claim to life in a realm of death. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS Ed approaches a mound of rubble where a building once stood. Determination etches his features as he sets about methodically removing pieces of concrete and twisted metal. With each thrust and pry of his makeshift tools, he paves a way through the destruction. His movements are heavy but precise, the products of a mind that refuses to surrender to defeat. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED OVERPASS - CONTINUOUS Ahead lies the skeletal remains of what was once a vital overpass, its concrete bones a grim parody of the city’s past prosperity. Ed braces himself and climbs, his upheaved hands finding cracks and purchase among the debris. His progress is slow and arduous, but the sight of the overpass’s peak, a symbol of hope, spurs him onward. CUT TO: EXT. CITYSCAPE - HIGH ANGLE - CONTINUOUS Ed reaches the summit of the overpass and pauses, his gaze sweeping over the horizon. The wreckage stretches as far as the eye can see, but this height gives perspective—there is a path to be forged, a direction to take. He takes a deep breath, the air a mingled scent of dust and destruction, and raises his wrench high. It’s a gesture of both challenge and resolve, a signal that his journey through this nightmare has only just begun. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 39 OF 150 PAGE 40 OF 150 EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - DAY ED’s lone figure is dwarfed by the gaping wound of the city. His every step is a testament to his unshakable resolve. The wrench, now an extension of his will, pierces the rubble blocking his path. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSED SUBWAY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS Ed approaches the maw of a collapsed subway entrance. Sunlight pierces through the cracks, casting slivers of light that dance on the mangled steel and broken tiles. With each piece of debris he removes, the way forward becomes clearer. He works in silence, his breaths and the sound of falling concrete the only interruptions in the deathly quiet. CUT TO: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS The darkness of the tunnel envelops Ed as he descends. The beam from his makeshift torch, fashioned from a rag and salvaged alcohol, flickers against the walls, throwing exaggerated shadows around him. He navigates the shattered remains of the underground with a mixture of zombie-like indifference and human caution, the two natures merged into one being, surviving by instinct and intellect. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS Ed emerges onto the cracked surface of a highway, once a vein pulsing with life, now a silent artery in a dead metropolis. He takes a moment to scan the expanse for movement, for any sign of those like him or worse. Empty cars stand as monuments to a sudden catastrophe, their doors agape, their stories untold. CUT TO: INT. CRUSHED CAR - CONTINUOUS Ed peers through the window of a half-collapsed vehicle. Inside, a skeleton grips the steering wheel, a stark reminder of society’s abrupt end. For a moment, Ed sees himself—not so different from the bones. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - OVERLOOK - CONTINUOUS Climbing atop a pile of rubble that offers a vantage point, Ed scans the horizon. His heart, whatever is left of it, aches. The city lies in ruins, but amidst the desolation, there is a faint echo of hope—a whisper of life. CUT TO: EXT. NARROW CREVICE BETWEEN BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS Ed finds a narrow passageway, wedged between two faltering skyscrapers. The space is tight, claustrophobic, but the fresh air beckoning from the other side is unmistakable—a breath of the world beyond. He squeezes through the gap, the walls scraping against his flesh, now so foreign to pain. As he emerges, the air hits him like a wave of the past. It’s tinged with the acrid scent of smoke and decay, yet underneath it all is the undeniable smell of survival. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - CONTINUOUS Ed stands at the threshold of the crevice, the firmament open before him. He takes a long, deep breath, feeling the air churn within his lungs—half-life, half-death. A resolve settles deep within his marrow. He steps forward, leaving the shadows behind. Ahead, the path is fraught with ruin and remembrance, but it is his to tread. With the wrench slung over his shoulder, Ed sets out into the sunlit devastation, a figure of determination silhouetted against the crumbling silhouette of a fallen world. FADE OUT.

The way in which the characters speak needs to be derived from their character traits, their cultural background and the scene's genre conventions. Please elaborate in detail on all events and dialogues that occur during the entirety of the scene, and don't write any part of the scene in brevity when providing the final output. In pursuance of the commands that were outlined in the previous paragraph, please write a coherent, elaborate, descriptive and detailed screenplay/shooting script, including a concise background (in which the events of the preceding scene leading to the events in the current scene are briefly described, explaining the source of the returning woman's surmounting urge to relieve herself and the reason why she hasn't relieved herself properly by the time she reaches the house), for a very long comedic scene in a Brazilian Telenovela TV Series that includes the following sequence of events: * A young woman (give her a name, and describe her physical appearance and clothing; she shouldn’t be wearing a dress, a skirt, leggings nor jeans in the scene) is returning home and approaching the door of her family’s apartment with a desperate urge to move her bowels. * When the returning woman reaches the door of the house, she realizes that she has misplaced her house key. The returning woman begins to frantically knock on the door, hoping that someone is present and might hear the knocks. A few moments pass without an answer. The returning woman's urge escalates to the brink of eruption. * Suddenly, the returning woman can hear a voice on the other side of the door asking about what’s happening - the voice of the present women (the present woman is the returning woman’s mom; give her a name and describe her appearance). * The present woman, after verifying the identity of the knocker, begins opening the door, but is taking too much time doing so for the returning woman's liking. The returning woman implores the present woman to open the door without specifying the source of urgency. * Once the present woman fully opens the door, the returning woman tells the present woman - who is standing in house’s entryway and is puzzled by the returning woman’s sense of urgency and even seems slightly concerned - to move out of the returning woman’s way and attempts to enter. As the returning woman attempts to enter the house, the obstructing present woman intercepts the returning woman and grabs on to her in concern. * The concerned present woman attempts to understand what’s wrong with the returning woman as she is gripping the returning woman and physically obstructing her path. The returning woman attempts to free herself from the present woman’s grip and get past her, and pleads with the obstructing present woman to step aside and just let her enter the house. The two women continue to bicker as they are entangled, with the present woman effectively denying the returning woman's access into the house out of concern. At no point during this exchange does the returning woman directly state that she has to reach the bathroom urgently. As this is happening, the returning woman's desperation to relieve herself is surging to its climax. * The returning woman reaches her limit and loses control. She groans abruptly and assumes an expression of shock and untimely relief on her face as she is gripped by the present woman, and begins pooping her pants. The perplexed present woman's grip loosens, and she tries to inquire what’s wrong with the returning woman. The returning woman gently breaks the perplexed present woman's grip by slowly receding and assuming a stance that is more convenient for relieving herself. Once she assumes the stance, the returning woman proceeds to forcefully push the contents of her bowels into her pants, grunting with exertion and relief as she does so. The present woman is befuddled by the returning woman’s actions. * The present woman continues to ask the returning woman if anything is wrong with her, but is met in response with a hushed and strained reply that indicates the returning woman’s relief and satisfaction from releasing her bowels (hinting at the fact that the returning woman is relieving herself in her pants at that very moment and savoring the release), together with soft grunts of exertion that almost sound as if they are filled with relief-induced satisfaction. The present woman attempts to inquire about the returning woman’s condition once again, but reaps a similar result, as the returning woman hasn’t finished relieving herself in her pants and is still savoring the relief while muttering to herself about it. The present woman stares in confusion tinged with concern as the returning woman continues to grunt and push the contents of her bowels into her pants while her face alternates between concentration and suppressed euphoria. * As she is giving the returning woman a puzzled stare, the present woman is met with the odor that is emanating from the deposit in the returning woman’s pants, causing the present woman to initially sniff the air. As this the present woman sniffs the air, the returning woman finishes relieving herself in her pants with a sigh of relief. * The present woman sniffs the air again, physically reacts to the odor and then verbally inquires about the source of the odor. The returning woman stares the present woman with a sheepish expression. In a single moment that shatters any confusion or denial the present woman may have had until that point, it then dawns upon her what had just happened. * With disgusted bewilderment, the present woman asks the returning woman if she just did what she thinks she did. The question is met with the returning woman's mortified silence. Then, in a slightly more prodding manner, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman asks the returning woman if the returning woman pooped her pants just now. The returning woman tries to avoid explicitly admitting to what had happened, and asks the present woman to finally allow her to enter. The disgusted present woman lets the returning woman enter while still reacting to the odor, beckoning the returning woman with disgust and impatience. * The returning woman begins to gingerly waddle into the house while holding/cupping the seat of her pants, passing by the present woman. As the returning woman is entering and passing by the present woman, the astonished present woman halts the returning woman a few steps past the entrance, warns her not to proceed yet so none of her pants' contents will drop on the floor. The returning woman initially reacts to this scolding with sheepish indignation. * The present woman continues to tauntingly scold the returning woman for having pooped her pants and for how dirty pooping her pants is. The returning woman remains standing in her spot, silently holding/cupping the seat of her pants in sheepish mortification, while the present woman physically reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman and complaining about how noisome the returning woman is right now. Then, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman that there is no acceptable reason for the returning woman putting herself in a situation where she childishly poops her pants and proceeds to ask the returning woman if the returning woman is ever going to grow up. * The returning woman, then, gradually starts growing out of her initial mortification and replies to the present woman with a playful sulk that what happened is the present woman’s fault because she took too long to open the door, blocked the returning woman’s path and prevented the returning woman from accessing the bathroom before the returning woman's urge got overbearing. * The present woman indignantly rejects the returning woman’s accusation as a viable excuse in any circumstance for a woman of the returning woman’s age. Then, she scolds the returning woman for staying put at the entrance and pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants, insisting that there is no reason to act so childishly even if the urge got overbearing. * The playfully disgruntled returning woman responds to the present woman’s admonishment by insisting that she desperately had to relieve her bowels and that she had to get everything out once she reached her breaking point as the urge was too strong, even if it meant that she would have to poop her pants completely. After that, the returning woman reiterates that the present woman's stalling and hindering near the door were the factors that forced the returning woman into such a situation where she poops her pants and that forced her to make such a decision as pushing out the whole bowel movement into her pants. * Following this, the returning woman hesitantly appraises the bulge in the seat of her own pants with her hand as her face bears a playful wince mixed with complacency, then wryly remarks that despite the circumstances forced upon her, it indeed felt relieving to finally release the poop, even if it was released in her pants, though she should now head to the bathroom to clean up. Then, as the returning woman gingerly attempts to head to the bathroom so she can clean up, the present women prevents the returning woman from leaving for the purpose of scolding her over her last comments. In response to the returning woman's last comments, the present woman mockingly admonishes the returning woman for being nasty because it seems like the returning woman feels good about something dirty like pooping her pants when she speaks positively about the relief she experienced once it happened. * Then, the present woman demands to get a closer look at the returning woman’s soiled pants in order to closely examine the dirty outcome of the returning woman's supposedly enjoyable deed. Following halfhearted resistance and protestation by the returning woman, the present woman succeeds in turning the returning woman around so she can inspect her rear end, and proceeds to incredulously taunt her for the nastiness of her bulging pants being full of so much poop. The present woman continues by tauntingly remarking that because it seemed like the returning woman felt so good as she was relieving herself in her pants, it wouldn't surprise the present woman if the returning woman also childishly enjoys having her pants be full of so much poop. * The returning woman coyly bickers with the present woman’s observation of her rear end, timidly protesting that her pants are full of so much poop because there was a lot in her stomach that needed to come out. As she speaks, the returning woman simultaneously touches the bulge with her hand. Then, she reiterates that despite of how dirty and full her pants are right now, she desperately needed relief due to the overbearing and the pooping provided that relief, so she might as well have gotten complete relief in its entirety. * In response, the present woman exclaims that the returning woman is nastily childish and tells her that she shouldn't have gotten herself into a situation where she poops her pants because of an overbearing urge or pressure in the first place. Then, the present woman goes on to assert that if the returning woman poops her pants with the contentment of a child who does so, then the returning woman should be treated like a child. While inspecting the bulge in the returning woman's pants in an infantilizing manner, the present woman proceeds to sniff near the seat of the returning woman’s pants as if the returning woman was an infant. The returning woman cringes as she is being inspected and sniffed by the present woman. Upon sniffing the seat of the returning woman's pants, the present woman reacts to the odor that is emanating from the returning woman with a mocking, infantilizing physical gesture and verbal ridicule. Then, the present woman proceeds to tauntingly scold the returning woman for being a particularly stinky girl in an infantilizing manner. * As she’s physically reacting to her own odor, the returning woman concedes that she is particularly smelly in her present state, and then wryly remarks in resignation that since the present woman is withholding the returning woman from cleaning up, the present woman is welcome to keep the returning woman there in her place, with the poop in her pants, so they can both enjoy the odor that is emanating from the returning woman. * The present woman dismisses the returning woman's last remark, scoldingly informing the returning woman that the returning woman won't be staying there any longer with the poop in her pants because her odor is unbearable. Then, as she is still physically reacting to the odor, the present woman proceeds to adamantly usher the returning woman off to the bathroom for cleaning while imploring the returning woman not to drop any her pants' contents on the floor. * The returning woman begins to waddle off as the present woman is escorting her to the bathroom, all while the present woman is continuing to react to the odor and while she, with comical disgust, is trying to physically assist the waddling returning woman with containing the contents of the returning woman's pants within the pants so they won't fall on the floor along the way. Along their way to the bathroom, the present woman comically warns the returning woman to be mindful of not dropping any of her pants' contents on the floor and constantly complains about how badly the mess in the returning woman's pants stinks. For her part, the returning woman is bashedly cringing and telling the returning woman that she feels like some of the mess is about to slide down her pants onto the floor. In reply, the present woman reiterates her exasperated warnings to the returning woman not to drop any of the mess that is in her pants on the the floor, while also reinforcing her own physical actions that attempt to assist the returning woman with the containment. * Upon reaching the bathroom, the returning woman teases the present woman one final time by stopping in place on the bathroom's threshold instead of entering and coyly asking the present woman if she would like to change the returning woman's \\"poopy diaper\\". As the returning woman is asking this, she is gesturing to the bulge in her pants. In retaliation for the returning woman's insolent teasing and as the climax for the present woman's incredulous frustration over the situation that has been building during the scene, the affronted present woman playfully grabs the bulge in the seat of the returning woman's pants and presses it to push the returning woman into the bathroom, forcefully and deliberately squashing the bulge and spreading the mess in the returning woman's pants in the process. With one hand holding/plugging her nose, the present woman exasperatedly tells the returning woman to get her dirty and smelly self into the bathroom immediately, as she is forcefully squashing the bulge and pushing the returning woman into the bathroom with the other hand. The present woman maintains her grab of the bulge and keeps squashing it intently for a few good moments to get her point across. As the bulge in her pants is being squashed and she is being pushed into the bathroom, the returning woman cries out in disgust and exclaims that the squashed mess has spread and smeared inside her pants. After the returning woman has been pushed into the bathroom, the present woman keeps holding/plugging her nose in reaction to the odor while telling the returning woman that the returning deserved to have her bulge squashed for her insolence. After that, the present woman closes the bathroom door and leaves while complaining to herself out loud about the returning woman being remarkably smelly from pooping her pants.","completion":"INT. BRAZILIAN APARTMENT BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY The scene opens with ISABELA, a 25-year-old woman with a desperation clear in her stride. She is of medium height, has tan skin, and wears her dark hair in a tousled ponytail. She's sportily dressed in a breathable, brightly colored workout tank top and a pair of black, form-fitting capris that are definitely not made for the situation she's about to endure. With each step towards her family's apartment door, the urgency in her movements grows more pronounced. CUT TO: EXT. APARTMENT DOOR - CONTINUOUS Isabela reaches into her bag as she approaches the door, her face contorting with discomfort. She pats down her pockets - no key. ISABELA (Thinking aloud) Not now, please... FRANTICALLY, she begins KNOCKING on the door, fidgeting, shuffling on her feet. Seconds feel like hours. Sweat beads on her brow, not from the Brazilian heat, but from the internal pressure that mounts. CUT TO: INT. APARTMENT ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS Through the door, the muffled RESPONSE of her mother, LUCRECIA, a woman in her mid-fifties with laugh lines and hair beginning to show streaks of silver. She's compassionately assertive - a matriarch through-and-through. LUCRECIA (O.S., concerned) Isabela? Is that you? What's happening? CUT TO: EXT. APARTMENT DOOR - CONTINUOUS Isabela’s DREAD is palpable. She bounces on the balls of her feet, trying to maintain whatever composure she can muster. ISABELA (Holding back panic) Mom, please... open the door! The DOOR slowly CREAKS open, revealing Lucrecia. Her expression is a mix of confusion and mounting worry. ISABELA (Pushing past) Mom, move! LUCRECIA (Grabs Isabela, concerned) Mija, what is— ISABELA struggles against her mother’s concerned grip, the physical and verbal exchange growing more desperate— but no mention of the bathroom. LUCRECIA (Obstructing) Tell me what is wrong! ISABELA (Almost in tears) Let me in, please! Suddenly, Isabela’s expression changes to shock - her body stiffens. The SOUND of her discomfort is unabashedly visceral. CUT TO: INT. APARTMENT ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS Lucrecia's GRIP loosens when she hears the GROAN, her face showing deep concern and confusion. Isabela slowly recedes, now ASSUMING a stance that shows she's clearly in the middle of an involuntary bowel movement. Grunts and SIGHS of relief mix with discomfort. LUCRECIA (Wrapping her head around) Isa, what is happening? ISABELA (Through strained whispers) I... just... give me a moment... Lucrecia sniffs the air, her expression shifts from confusion to realization and disgust as it clicks. LUCRECIA (Disgustedly confirms) Mija, did you just...? ISABELA, unable to bring herself to confirm, pleads with her eyes for understanding and silently ushers herself in. ISABELA (Embarrassed) Just let me inside, please... Reluctantly, Lucrecia steps aside with a GESTURE of both disgust and urgency. Isabela WADDLES inside, cupping the seat of her soiled capris. As she passes her mother, Lucrecia stops her with an ESTABLISHING HAND and a look of disbelief. LUCRECIA (Stern but mocking) Don't move! You're going to drop... that... on the floor! ISABELA (Defensive) Mom! Lucrecia SCOLDS her, her words dripping with incredulity and mock concern. LUCRECIA (Exasperated) What possessed you to... Are you ever going to grow up? ISABELA (With playful defiance) You took forever! You were blocking me! LUCRECIA Snide) No excuse for this, Isabela. For someone your age... ISABELA (Backpedaling but insistent) I couldn't hold it. If you hadn’t— She WRYLY RUBS the bulge in the seat of her pants, a mix of embarrassment and stubborn satisfaction. ISABELA (Admits grudgingly) Okay, it felt good... to let it out, but I need to clean up now. Lucrecia BLOCKS her path, visibly shaken by Isabela’s words and the growing stench. LUCRECIA (Mocking tone) Enjoying yourself? Let me see... After some PROTEST, Lucrecia INSPECTS Isabela’s behind, taunting her with disdain. LUCRECIA (Smirking) Seems like you had... too much fun! ISABELA (Coyly) I needed relief, Mom. LUCRECIA (Infantilizing tone) A grown woman shouldn't end up like this... So childish! Lucrecia audibly SNIFFS near Isabela’s soiled pants to reinforce her point, Isabela CRINGES. LUCRECIA (Mocking infantile scold) Oh, what a stinky girl we have here! ISABELA (Admitting sheepishly) Just let me clean up, since you're so keen on the smell. LUCRECIA (Directing sharply) You can’t stay like this. Move, but carefully! Isabela WADDLES off towards the bathroom, guided by Lucrecia, who continues to REACT to the odor. LUCRECIA (Dramatically) Mind the floor! And that stink! ISABELA (Flustered) Feels like I'll drop something... LUCRECIA (Aggravated) Don’t you dare! Reaching the bathroom threshold, Isabela turns with MICHIEF in her eye. ISABELA (Teasing) Want to change my \\"poopy diaper\\"? This hits a NERVE in Lucrecia, prompting a playfully ANGERED response. She SQUASHES the bulge, admonishing Isabela as she SHOVES her into the bathroom. LUCRECIA (Forceful) Into the shower now, young lady!

Ниже приведен общий пример использования внешнего жесткого диска для установки Hackintosh: 1. Подготовка жесткого диска: - Подключите внешний жесткий диск к другому работающему Mac или используйте виртуальную машину с macOS. - Отформатируйте внешний диск в формате macOS Extended (Journaled) и создайте на нём раздел GUID Partition Map. 2. Создание установочного образа: - Скачайте установщик macOS из Mac App Store. - Используйте терминал или специальную программу (например, DiskMaker X или Install Disk Creator) для создания установочного образа на внешнем жестком диске. 3. Подготовка к установке: - Если вы используете специализированный инструмент для создания загрузочных накопителей Hackintosh (например, UniBeast), следуйте инструкциям, чтобы добавить нужные драйверы и настройки. - Произведите настройку BIOS/UEFI на компьютере, который будет использоваться для установки Hackintosh (отключите Secure Boot, включите AHCI для SATA, установите режим загрузки в Legacy или UEFI в зависимости от вашего образа). 4. Установка: - Подключите внешний жесткий диск к компьютеру, на котором должен быть установлен Hackintosh. - Загрузитесь с внешнего жесткого диска, обычно через меню выбора загрузочного устройства (обычно это клавиша F12, F10, ESC или F2 во время запуска системы). - Следуйте инструкциям установщика macOS, выбирая внешний жесткий диск в качестве места установки. 5. Послеустановочная настройка: - После успешной установки, вы возможно потребуете использовать инструменты такие как MultiBeast для установки драйверов и настройки системы под вашу конкретную аппаратную конфигурацию. 6. Перемещение системы на внутренний диск (если это было целью): - Если вы устанавливали macOS на внешний жесткий в качестве промежуточного этапа, после успешной установки и настройки драйверов вы можете клонировать установку на внутренний накопитель вашего компьютера. Это очень обобщенное описание процесса. Создание Hackintosh - это сложная задача, требующая хорошего понимания работы macOS и PC-хардвера. Кроме того, есть юридические и этические аспекты использования macOS на неподдерживаемом оборудовании, так как это нарушает лицензионное соглашение Apple. Убедитесь, что вы понимаете все возможные последствия до начала."},{"prompt":"Я имею в виду вообще без носителя, ни жеский диск, ни флешка","completion":"Установка Hackintosh без использования какого-либо физического носителя значительно сложнее и может потребовать продвинутых знаний и навыков. Вариант, который можно рассмотреть, – это установка через сетевую загрузку (NetBoot), но это потребует настройки сетевого сервера для обслуживания установочных файлов macOS. Другим методом может быть прямое копирование образа системы на диск. Один из возможных способов: 1. Использование другого Mac или виртуальной машины с macOS для прямого копирования системы на раздел Hackintosh: - На рабочем Mac или виртуальной машины с macOS создайте установочный образ системы используя команду \`createinstallmedia\`. - Подключитесь к целевому компьютеру через режим целевого диска (Target Disk Mode), сетевое хранилище или каким-то другим способом, который позволяет видеть и использовать раздел/диск целевого компьютера как внешнее устройство. - С помощью утилиты Disk Utility или команды \`dd\` клонируйте установочный образ на раздел Hackintosh. - После копирования, отключите и перезагрузите целевой компьютер с выбранного раздела. 2. Использование сетевой установки (NetBoot/Netinstall): - Настройте сервер (через macOS Server App или другие средства), который будет представлять сетевой загрузочный образ для установки macOS. - Конфигурируйте целевой компьютер для сетевой загрузки, указав в BIOS/UEFI параметры для загрузки через сеть. - Проведите загрузку и установку macOS через сетевой интерфейс. Оба из этих методов достаточно сложны и предполагают высокое понимание работы сетей, операционных систем и доступа к требуемому оборудованию для выполнения необходимых действий. Кроме того, они могут потребовать настройки серверной инфраструктуры и не гарантируют успеха из-за возможных несоответствий в оборудовании и ограничений в BIOS/UEFI различных материнских плат. Всегда помните о лицензионных ограничениях и о том, что установка macOS на несертифицированное Apple оборудование нарушает лицензионное соглашение End User License Agreement (EULA) Apple.

В этой игре, Эд участвует в гротескном телешоу, созданном человеком по имени Ханз Шоумастер. Шоу называется \\"Rundead\\", где Эд должен пройти через серию зловещих препятствий и испытаний, чтобы в конце концов встретиться с Беном. Полный сюжет фильма \\"RUN ZOMBIE, RUN\\": Акт 1: Введение в мир и персонажей Открытие фильма: • Фильм начинается в мирное время, в современном научном городе, где жизнь кипит и наука бурлит. • Эд – талантливый учёный, занятый исследованиями в области биотехнологий вместе со своей женой и коллегами. Они стоят на пороге прорыва: создания вакцины для вечной жизни и молодости. • Научный отдел в восторге от открытия, в лаборатории царит атмосфера торжества. После успешной презентации их эксперимента над крысами, Эд и его жена возвращаются домой, чтобы отпраздновать успех. Шторм наступает: • Интимные моменты между Эдом и его женой дома. Они обсуждают планы на будущее, их романтическая встреча переходит в страстный вечер. • Когда после утро голые с обьятием жены в постели,и через некоторое время начинают звонить в телефон эда и сообщают что в вашем лаборотории что-то случилось не хорошее. • Радость прерывается известием о трагедии: инфицированная крыса умерла и восстала как зомби, сбежав из лаборатории и начав заражение города. • Пока Эд и его жена отдыхают, город погружается в хаос. Зомби-вирус быстро распространяется, затрагивая школы, больницы, улицы. Трагический перелом: • На следующее утро Эд и его жена возвращаются в лабораторию и обнаруживают сбежавшую крысу. Новости сообщают о массовом заражении. • Они пытаются дозвониться до детей и родственников, но безуспешно. Улицы заполнены зомби. Лаборатория осаждена толпой заражённых. • После нападения зомби, Эда укусили, и он принимает экспериментальную вакцину. Он вынужден покинуть свою жену, которая жертвует собой, чтобы спасти его. Ядерный удар: • Эд, полузомби, узнаёт о намерениях властей сбросить на город ядерную бомбу. С помощью своих новых способностей он прячется в подземном бункере. • Бомба стирает город с лица земли, уничтожая всех его обитателей, как живых, так и мёртвых. Акт 2: Развитие сюжета и персонажей Эд выходит на поверхность: • После взрыва Эд, один из немногих выживших, покидает своё убежище. Мир, который он знал, больше не существует. • Он встречает Бена, мальчика-сироту, выжившего в руинах города. Между ними завязывается необычная дружба. Выживание в разрушенном мире: • Эд и Бен ищут припасы и остатки цивилизации, стараясь выжить среди развалин и постоянной угрозы зомби. • По мере их путешествия за руинами, Эд начинает терять остатки своего человечества и борется с внутренними демонами. Акт 3: Кульминация и разрешение конфликта Шоу \\"Rundead\\": • Ханз Шоумастер, выживший продюсер, создаёт телешоу \\"Rundead\\" и похищает Бена, чтобы использовать его в качестве приза для Эда. • Эд, теперь полностью зомби, но сохранивший воспоминания о Бене, проходит через жестокие испытания шоу. Финальная битва и трагедия: • Эд освобождает Бена, но внезапно теряет остатки человечности и атакует его, не в силах сопротивляться своему зомби-инстинкту. • Бен превращается в зомби, и они уходят вместе, оставляя мир во власти хаоса и зомби-апокалипсиса. Заключение: • Фильм заканчивается на тёмной ноте. Эд и Бен, теперь оба зомби, сидят на разрушенном мосту, смотря на новый мир, который никогда не будет таким, каким был когда-то. Фильм \\"RUN ZOMBIE, RUN\\" показывает темную сторону человеческой изобретательности и последствия игры с природой. Со смешанными чувствами ужаса и сочувствия зрители следят за путешествием Эда от великого открытия до конечного падения в бездну живых мертвецов. Саундтреки будут браться из оригинальной игры BEN AND ED (2015 года) Дополнительные саундтреки: 1. Песня Yota - The Runner, финальная сцена, где зомби ED будет бежать c предпринимателем HANZ SHOWMASTER который создал величайшее в мире шоу и будут преодолевать препятствии. Зомби ЭД столкнет HANZ SHOWMASTER c площадки и он умирает. 2. Песня The Cranberries - Zombie, сцена, где весь механизм вышел из под контроля, испытания стали чрезвычайно сложными, и люди которые смотрят это шоу начинают убегать от атаков зомби. Время продолжает заканчиваться и платформа в очень скором времени падает в лаву. Зомби ED берет в себя в руки и начинает быстро преодолевать все препятствия под эту песню за одну минуту, пока время полностью не истекало. Последние секунды заканчивается и платформа начинает падать в лаву. ED перепрыгивает из платформы и ухватывается руками на землю. А дальше он старается подняться из земли, чтобы не упасть в раскаленную лаву.

The knowledge that their breakthrough is responsible for the terror gripping the city is an unbearable burden. MARIA (overwhelmed) Our children… are they… DR. STEVENS (interrupting, grim) I’ve been trying to reach the schools all morning. Communications are down city-wide. We don’t know who’s… who’s still alive. Ed slams a fist on the console in frustration, his rage a silent scream challenging the chaos. Maria turns to him, eyes pooling with tears—desperation etched on her face. MARIA (pleading) We have to do something, Ed! ED (resolute) And we will. We fix this. We find the cure and distribute it.

ED (panting, pain-ridden) Maria… I don’t have much time… MARIA (shaking her head) Don’t say that. We’ll find the antidote. We’ll… Ed gives a pained smile, his eyes reflecting both love and sorrow. ED (urgently) Listen to me. You need to continue without me. Find the cure, Maria. MARIA collapses beside him, the horror of the moment washing over her. The reality they tried to escape has consumed them, as the weight of their predicament settles like a shroud. FADE OUT.

MARIA scrambles, her hands fumbling through vials and medical supplies, searching for anything that might save ED. He lies on a cot, his complexion growing paler, his breaths shallow. MARIA’s hands shake as she uncaps a vial labeled “Prototype Antidote 7A.” Desperation fills her eyes as she fills a syringe and turns to ED with steely determination. MARIA (breathlessly) Ed, this is experimental, but it’s based on our earlier research. It could save you. ED (weakly, but with a firm resolve) Do it… anything for a chance. Maria injects the contents into his arm. They wait, the seconds stretching into an eternity. Suddenly, Ed convulses, a guttural groan escaping his lips as his body reacts to the drug. MARIA (frantic) Hold on, Ed! Hold on! His convulsions slow, then stop. Slowly, his breathing steadies, and the color begins to return to his cheeks. Maria sighs with relief as she watches him, her own body sagging with exhaustion. ED (voice stronger) Maria… it’s working. I can feel it fighting the virus. MARIA collapses beside him, tears of relief streaming down her face. They embrace, a moment of hope amidst the terror that surrounds them. Suddenly, the door bursts open, ZOMBIES spill into the room, their groans filling the air with dread. With a surge of adrenaline, MARIA springs to her feet, seizing a nearby fire extinguisher. She sprays the advancing horde, her other hand grabbing Ed, pulling him towards an emergency exit. ED (urgently) Go, Maria! Get out of here! MARIA shakes her head, determination blazing in her eyes. MARIA (screaming) Not without you, Ed! Just as they reach the door, a ZOMBIE lunges, its teeth bared for Maria’s neck. In a split-second decision, Ed shoves her through the door, slamming it behind her, locking himself inside with the undead. MARIA (desperately pounding the door) ED! No! But Ed’s fate is sealed.

MARIA (declaration of war on the apocalypse) This is only the beginning. Run zombie, run. END OF PAGE 30 OF 150 PAGE 31 OF 150 EXT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - MORNING ED KAYNES, his body a mismatch of human fear and zombified resilience, slips through the shattered gates of what was once a sanctuary of learning. A tattered scarf partially conceals his grotesque features, signs of his incomplete transformation into the undead. Silently, he navigates the overgrown courtyard, each step deliberate to avoid drawing attention. Windows, dark and soulless, gape open like the eyes of the dead—witnesses to the devastation within. CUT TO: INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS Ed’s entry is a mirror to his internal chaos—a man, formerly a herald of progress, now reduced to a creature of instinct and desperation. His gait, once confident, is now a sober march into the unknown. He tiptoes past classrooms where silent echoes of children’s laughter are replaced by the somber reality of abandonment. Broken furniture and scattered papers litter the floor—a flashback to the day when life unraveled. A weak groan echoes down the hall as Ed pauses, a sideways glance revealing a lone zombie staggering between the desks of what used to be a third-grade classroom. Ed suppresses a shudder, steeling himself against the macabre scenery.

Sunlight streams through broken skylights, carving shadows that pool like blood on the hardwood floor. He scans the rafters, a haunting tableau of memories and lost days playing out in the sunbeams. As real as the danger is, it’s the threat of finding irrevocable truth that tightens his chest—a father’s fear, potent even in undeath. But there’s no trace, no joyous clamor of children, no after-school exclamations. They’re gone, swept away by the cataclysm that swept through their lives like a malevolent tide. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS Ed emerges from the school, the line between man and zombie blurred by his faltering, heart-wrenching mission.

He is the epitome of the isolated soul—lost in the chasm between the living and the not. Remnants of humanity nest in the bunker—photographs, clothes, a child’s crayon drawing affixed to a wall. Through the stillness, Ed’s rasping breath is a dissonant chorus, filling the void with his internal war. ED (muttering to himself) I’ll find them—alive or… I must. He rises, a gaunt figure against the backdrop of monitors flickering with disconnected surveillance feeds.

ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed, crawling through the mayhem, reaches for the bunker’s emergency protocols—a last-ditch hope to seal away the cataclysm that hunts for him within his sanctuary. Lights flicker overhead, many winking out, as the integrity of their fixtures fail. He hits the master lockdown button, and with a metallic groan, reinforced doors slide shut, drowning the chaos into muffled fury. The sanctuary becomes sarcophagus. Over the din of destruction, Ed’s distorted cry resonates—half man, half beast, all despair. ED (screaming above the noise) Survive! I must… survive… The camera pulls out from the scene, leaving Ed a solitary, writhing figure amidst the anarchy that ensnares him—an amalgam of man’s hubris and the savage grip of nature’s retribution, locked in a bunker, locked in turmoil. FADE OUT: END OF PAGE 36 OF 150 PAGE 37 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Amidst the chaos and the runaway dance of shadows and light, ED struggles against the unforgiving floor that refuses to stay still beneath him. His limbs, misshapen by his condition and shaken by the concussive forces, push against the tiles with a strength born from the darkest depths of survival instinct. Grit and dust cake his flesh as he labors for breath, a horrifying rasp that competes with the bunker’s groans and the distant, thunderous booms that refuse to fade away. Pain lances through him; whether from the fall, the shockwaves, or his own internal transformation, it’s impossible to tell. But it fuels him, drives him—the agony a reminder of life amidst a landscape that speaks only of annihilation. CUT TO: EXT. CITY RUINS - SAME MOMENT A cloud of dust and debris blankets the horizon where the city once teemed with life. The singular fury of the initial blast has given birth to countless offspring—sporadic eruptions that devour the remnants of a world now confined to memory and echoes. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed gasps, his body hauled up to an unsteady crouch, fingertips white-knuckled as they grip a shattered piece of the console for support. Desperation swims in his eyes—a cocktail of torment, the will to endure, the knowledge that to succumb now is to surrender to the void. He scans the room through the haze, sees the sealed blast doors, the blinking red of systems barely clinging to function. In this stolen pause, where death seems to have drawn in a breath, Ed finds a semblance of order amidst the tumult. ED (voice a raspy whisper tinged with determination) Not yet… Not today… Tremors wrack his form, but they cannot break the spirit that fuels his battered frame. This bunker, this grave, this womb—it will not be his terminus. With a shake of his head, Ed stands fully, a testament to defiance. His cries subside to murmurs, to mantras of survival that carry him forward—a symphony played against the thunderous backdrop of the world’s end. FADE TO BLACK: END OF PAGE 37 OF 150 PAGE 38 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker’s foundation rattles under the relentless assault, dust cascading like tiny waterfalls from the ceiling. ED, half-zombie, stands amidst a glistening coat of sweat and grime, swaying unevenly as the earth beneath him convulses. He fixates on the emergency lighting, its flickering a spasmodic dirge to the rhythm of apocalypse, his mind racing with primal urgency. Every painful breath is a struggle, drowning in a sea of helplessness and confusion. His flesh, marked both by the zest of the undead and the scars of scientific torment, stretches over his hands as if trying to flee from the bone. His ashen lips mutter a garbled prayer to loved ones lost to either fate or the flame. Ed staggers forward, a mote of dust in the grim tableau of his sanctuary. He salvages a heavy crowbar from the scattered arsenal of survival tools. Its heft gives him a grotesque sense of purpose—a weapon against the barriers that cage him. Footsteps echo with thunderous intent, resonating upon the metal floor, as he assumes the stance of one prepared to battle titans. With a grunt, he wedges the crowbar into the seams of a heavy looking hatch, muscles and sinews bulging in grotesque relief against his lab coat. The strain reddens his eyes, fueling veins with an unnerving fervor. Gritted teeth are bared, the intonation of pained struggle filling the space, as he channels every ounce of his monstrous strength into the task. The metal groans, protesting, as if the very bunker itself is aware of Ed’s unwinnable war against time. With each incremental victory of leverage, the raw scrape of crowbar against hatch is a requiem for reason, a siren call of the myriad dead and dying above. ED (straining, a whisper to himself) Survive, protect, endure… No matter the cost. A sudden lurch, and the hatch gives way, surrendering to Ed’s determination with a scream of yielding steel. A dim shaft of light, alien in the confines of the bunker, pierces the grimy air—a fragile thread leading back to the chaos of a once familiar world. Ed, panting, a line of blood trickling from where the crowbar had slipped, rights himself—a ghastly architect of his own salvation or doom, straddling two realms he never wished to know. The bunker stands defiant, its heart now exposed. And as the camera zooms out, Ed, the anomaly, reaches toward the beckoning light—a specter grappling with the very essence of existence and annihilation. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 38 OF 150 PAGE 39 OF 150 EXT. CITYSCAPE - DAY From the depths of the bunker, ED emerges into a world transformed beyond recognition. A vast wasteland of destruction stretches before him, the cityscape now a twisted shadow of its former self. The ground, littered with debris and the remnants of buildings, challenges every step. Yet Ed advances, his silhouette a stark contrast against the backdrop of a demolished city. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Back inside the shaking bunker, Ed’s hands move with purpose, fueled by an unyielding instinct for survival and protection. He scans the room, now a collapsed chamber of his former life, searching for anything that will aid his escape. He spots his toolbox, hurled by the tremors to a corner. Within lies a collection of tools, each associated with a memory of maintenance and preparedness, each now essential for a far grimmer purpose. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED STREET - CONTINUOUS Ed navigates the treacherous terrain. He grips a robust pipe wrench, repurposed now as a cudgel to fend off the encroaching undead and clear his path of obstacles. His movements are mechanical, devoid of the finesse of the living but driven by a persistent will that seems almost alien in these ruins. Each swing of the wrench is a statement of defiance, a claim to life in a realm of death. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS Ed approaches a mound of rubble where a building once stood. Determination etches his features as he sets about methodically removing pieces of concrete and twisted metal. With each thrust and pry of his makeshift tools, he paves a way through the destruction. His movements are heavy but precise, the products of a mind that refuses to surrender to defeat. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED OVERPASS - CONTINUOUS Ahead lies the skeletal remains of what was once a vital overpass, its concrete bones a grim parody of the city’s past prosperity. Ed braces himself and climbs, his upheaved hands finding cracks and purchase among the debris. His progress is slow and arduous, but the sight of the overpass’s peak, a symbol of hope, spurs him onward. CUT TO: EXT. CITYSCAPE - HIGH ANGLE - CONTINUOUS Ed reaches the summit of the overpass and pauses, his gaze sweeping over the horizon. The wreckage stretches as far as the eye can see, but this height gives perspective—there is a path to be forged, a direction to take. He takes a deep breath, the air a mingled scent of dust and destruction, and raises his wrench high. It’s a gesture of both challenge and resolve, a signal that his journey through this nightmare has only just begun. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 39 OF 150 PAGE 40 OF 150 EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - DAY ED’s lone figure is dwarfed by the gaping wound of the city. His every step is a testament to his unshakable resolve. The wrench, now an extension of his will, pierces the rubble blocking his path. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSED SUBWAY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS Ed approaches the maw of a collapsed subway entrance. Sunlight pierces through the cracks, casting slivers of light that dance on the mangled steel and broken tiles. With each piece of debris he removes, the way forward becomes clearer. He works in silence, his breaths and the sound of falling concrete the only interruptions in the deathly quiet. CUT TO: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS The darkness of the tunnel envelops Ed as he descends. The beam from his makeshift torch, fashioned from a rag and salvaged alcohol, flickers against the walls, throwing exaggerated shadows around him. He navigates the shattered remains of the underground with a mixture of zombie-like indifference and human caution, the two natures merged into one being, surviving by instinct and intellect. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS Ed emerges onto the cracked surface of a highway, once a vein pulsing with life, now a silent artery in a dead metropolis. He takes a moment to scan the expanse for movement, for any sign of those like him or worse. Empty cars stand as monuments to a sudden catastrophe, their doors agape, their stories untold. CUT TO: INT. CRUSHED CAR - CONTINUOUS Ed peers through the window of a half-collapsed vehicle. Inside, a skeleton grips the steering wheel, a stark reminder of society’s abrupt end. For a moment, Ed sees himself—not so different from the bones. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - OVERLOOK - CONTINUOUS Climbing atop a pile of rubble that offers a vantage point, Ed scans the horizon. His heart, whatever is left of it, aches. The city lies in ruins, but amidst the desolation, there is a faint echo of hope—a whisper of life. CUT TO: EXT. NARROW CREVICE BETWEEN BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS Ed finds a narrow passageway, wedged between two faltering skyscrapers. The space is tight, claustrophobic, but the fresh air beckoning from the other side is unmistakable—a breath of the world beyond. He squeezes through the gap, the walls scraping against his flesh, now so foreign to pain. As he emerges, the air hits him like a wave of the past. It’s tinged with the acrid scent of smoke and decay, yet underneath it all is the undeniable smell of survival. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - CONTINUOUS Ed stands at the threshold of the crevice, the firmament open before him. He takes a long, deep breath, feeling the air churn within his lungs—half-life, half-death. A resolve settles deep within his marrow. He steps forward, leaving the shadows behind. Ahead, the path is fraught with ruin and remembrance, but it is his to tread. With the wrench slung over his shoulder, Ed sets out into the sunlit devastation, a figure of determination silhouetted against the crumbling silhouette of a fallen world. FADE OUT.

They then go to shoplift eggs and milk from a supermarket, and after this it's revealed that these aren't actually the real deal, and just impostors. The fake Judy and Nick are arrested by the real Judy and Nick for identity theft, shoplifting, and impersonating ZPD officers. (NOTE: Add a scene where Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde confess that they're lactose intolerant. If Judy or Nick ACTUALLY DO consume any dairy products in the movie, don't add the scene and add a note instead explaining where Judy or Nick consume the dairy products)","completion":"In the bustling metropolis of Zootopia, where every day was a new adventure for Officer Judy Hopps and her sly partner, Nick Wilde, something peculiar stirred beneath the city's vibrant hum. For the citizens and fellow ZPD officers, Judy and Nick were the epitome of an odd but synchronized pair—sugar and spice in a uniform-blue guise. But today, the duo's quirks seemed more eccentric than endearing. It began as they waltzed into Precinct One with their usual banter, but the jokes didn't land quite right—Nick's wit lost its edge and Judy's vivacity felt forced. Clawhauser, donut-dusted and as observant as a cat tracking a laser pointer, furrowed his brow when fake Nick passed up his proffered bowl of jelly-filled delights. \\"No donuts for me, Clawhauser. I'm watching my figure,\\" pseudo-Nick declared with an exaggerated wink. Yet the iota of uneasiness that often laced through Nick's sass was conspicuously missing. Meanwhile, not-Judy's nose twitched less than usual as she addressed her fellow officers. This version of Judy laid out the patrol plans like she was reading a restaurant menu, her usual passion for justice registered as nothing but a flat, rehearsed rhythm. Shift after shift, the Zootopia populace bestowed puzzled stares at the peculiar pair. Was it a full moon or had they both woken up on the wrong side of the burrow? The pinnacle of this out-of-character escapade manifested as the two found themselves in the grocery aisle, uncharacteristically draped in trench coats despite the clement weather. They suspiciously hovered around the dairy section, exchanging coded whispers. \\"Operation Omelette is a go,\\" whispered pseudo-Judy as fake-Nick nodded, his green eyes scanning for witnesses. Arm-in-arm, they sauntered past the eggs and milk, subtly scooping them into hidden pockets before hurrying towards the exit, bypassing the cash register with unnatural nonchalance. Anyone who knew them might have choked on their carrot juice or coughed up their pawpsicle at the sight. In the movie, Judy is never explicitly shown consuming dairy, and given her rabbit-ness, it's entirely plausible she might be lactose intolerant. Similarly, while Nick might be less biologically opposed to dairy, it's never integral to his on-screen character. Given this, let's continue with the original narrative. Onlookers gasped. Judy Hopps, the epitome of lawful goodness, and Nick Wilde, the reformed con-artist, shoplifting? Then out of nowhere, like a bolt from the blue, or rather, the bolt of a police-issue taser, the real Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde appeared—cuffs ready. \\"You have the right to remain silent, though I doubt you two are familiar with the concept,\\" quipped the real Nick, slapping cuffs on his doppelgänger. The fake Nick Wolfe could only yelp as his eerie green eyes, a shade that didn't quite match the original's, flickered with defeat. \\"And impersonating officers? That's a new low even for lookalikes,\\" Judy admonished, her real nose twitching indignantly as she detained the fraudulent Judy. \\"We're lactose intolerant, by the way. Wouldn't be caught dead stealing milk!\\" A collective sigh of relief washed over the crowd. Order had been restored, and the frauds unmasked. The real Judy and Nick, the indefatigable defenders of Zootopia's peace, had outfoxed the impersonators in a delightful twist of fate. As the two faux fiends were hauled away, their motives remained a mystery to some, but the message rang clear through the streets of the city: In Zootopia, you can be anything, but you can't be Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde.

Оптимизировать Windows подобно macOS в буквальном смысле невозможно, однако вы можете предпринять ряд шагов, чтобы улучшить производительность Windows и приблизить её пользовательский опыт к макинтошам: # Ускорение работы системы и повышение производительности 1. **Освободите место на диске.** Удалите ненужные файлы с помощью встроенной утилиты \\"Очистка диска\\" или сторонних программ (CCleaner и т.п.). 2. **Отключите автозагрузку ненужных программ.** Используйте диспетчер задач (Ctrl+Shift+Esc -> автозагрузка) для управления программами, которые запускаются при старте системы. 3. **Отключите визуальные эффекты.** Перейдите в \\"Система\\" -> \\"Дополнительные параметры системы\\" -> \\"Производительность\\" и настройте для обеспечения лучшей производительности. 4. **Обновите драйверы.** Убедитесь, что драйверы вашей системы обновлены до последних версий. 5. **Увеличьте файл подкачки.** Если ваш компьютер сталкивается с недостатком оперативной памяти, возможно, увеличение размера файла подкачки поможет. 6. **Отключите индексацию.** Если вы не используете часто поиск по системе, можно отключить индексацию файлов для ускорения доступа к файлам. 7. **Выполните оптимизацию диска.** Используйте утилиту дефрагментации диска для улучшения скорости чтения/записи. 8. **Проверьте на наличие вирусов и малвари.** Используйте антивирусную программу, чтобы убедиться, что ваша система не заражена вредоносным ПО. # Улучшение внешнего вида и повышение комфорта использования 1. **Изменение темы.** Выберите тему оформления, которая больше напоминает визуальный стиль macOS. 2. **Используйте док-подобные приложения.** RocketDock или Nexus Dock позволяют добавить на рабочий стол панель быстрого запуска, схожую с док-панелью на macOS. 3. **Используйте виртуальные рабочие столы.** Windows 10 и 11 имеют функционал виртуальных рабочих столом, что приближает её к этой функции в macOS. 4. **Измените иконки системы**. С помощью специальных программ вы можете заменить иконки Windows на более похожие на macOS. 5. **Настройте жесты тачпада.** Если ваше устройство поддерживает сенсорный тачпад, в настройках Windows есть возможность настроить жесты. 6. **Отрегулируйте шрифты и масштабирование.** macOS известна своим качественным рендерингом шрифтов. Настройте шрифты и масштабирование в Windows, чтобы улучшить читаемость текста. 7. **Настройка \\"горячих углов\\"**. Стандартного функционала для этого в Windows нет, но можно использовать сторонние приложения типа Hot Corners. Следует помнить, что не все аспекты macOS можно перенести на Windows, так как операционные системы разрабатывались с разными целями и концепциями._evening"},{"prompt":"Как мне сделать шрифты как в mac os на винде 1 в 1","completion":"Достичь точного совпадения шрифтов в Windows и macOS невозможно, так как обе операционные системы используют разные технологии рендеринга шрифтов, и у Apple есть свои эксклюзивные шрифты, такие как San Francisco, которые не лицензируются для использования на других платформах. Тем не менее, вы можете приблизить отображение шрифтов в Windows к тому, что вы видите на Mac, используя следующие методы: # Изменение шрифтов 1. Скачайте шрифты, похожие на используемые в macOS, например \\"Segoe UI\\" в Windows довольно похож на \\"San Francisco\\" в macOS. Некоторые пользователи также используют шрифты \\"Helvetica Neue\\" или \\"Lucida Grande\\", которые ранее использовались в macOS. 2. Установите скачанные шрифты в Windows, щелкнув правой кнопкой мыши на файле шрифта и выбрав \\"Установить\\". 3. Затем перейдите в \\"Панель управления\\" → \\"Оформление и персонализация\\" → \\"Шрифты\\" и проверьте, появился ли новый шрифт в списке доступных. # Настройка сглаживания шрифтов Windows использует технологию ClearType для сглаживания шрифтов, которая отличается от технологии сглаживания шрифтов в macOS. 1. Чтобы настроить ClearType, зайдите в \\"Панель управления\\" → \\"Шрифты\\" → \\"Настроить ClearType текст\\" и следуйте инструкциям мастера настройки ClearType. Это поможет улучшить сглаживание шрифтов. 2. Вы можете экспериментировать с настройками ClearType, чтобы найти оптимальное отображение для вашего дисплея. # Увеличение DPI и масштабирование macOS имеет хорошие возможности масштабирования для дисплеев Retina, которые обеспечивают чёткость текста при любом масштабе. В Windows вы можете изменить масштабирование, чтобы улучшить читаемость шрифтов: 1. Перейдите в \\"Настройки\\" → \\"Система\\" → \\"Дисплей\\" и измените масштабирование экрана (обычно рекомендуется начать с 125% или 150%). 2. Убедитесь, что вы используете рекомендуемое разрешение экрана для вашего монитора, чтобы шрифты выглядели максимально чётко. Обратите внимание, что даже после всех настроек различия в рендеринге шрифтов между Windows и macOS останутся из-за особенностей каждой из операционных систем. Но правильная настройка шрифтов и сглаживания может значительно улучшить опыт чтения текста на вашем компьютере с Windows."},{"prompt":"Как сделать анимации виндовс 10 как у мак ос","completion":"Анимации в Windows 10 и macOS различаются как по своему дизайну, так и по исполнению, и реплицировать стиль анимации macOS на Windows не всегда возможно без стороннего программного обеспечения. Однако можно попытаться имитировать некоторые эффекты и изменить поведение анимаций в Windows так, чтобы они напоминали macOS. Вот несколько шагов для кастомизации анимаций Windows 10: # Изменение анимаций системы: 1. **Анимация окон и папок:** Перейдите в \`Панель управления\` → \`Система и безопасность\` → \`Система\` → \`Дополнительные параметры системы\` → вкладка \`Дополнительно\` → кнопка \`Параметры\` в разделе \`Быстродействие\` → \`Визуальные эффекты\`. Здесь вы можете включить или отключить различные визуальные эффекты, включая анимацию при открытии и закрытии окон. 2. **Масштабирование текста и элементов интерфейса:** Для этого перейдите к \`Настройки\` → \`Система\` → \`Дисплей\` и измените масштаб дисплея, чтобы элементы интерфейса казались больше и имели более плавное движение, как в macOS. # Использование стороннего программного обеспечения: 1. **WindowFX:** Это программное обеспечение от Stardock позволяет настраивать анимации открытия, закрытия, сворачивания и разворачивания окон. Некоторые из анимаций могут приблизить визуальные эффекты Windows к стилю macOS. 2. **AquaSnap:** Этот инструмент может добавить некоторые улучшения в управлении окнами, подобные тем, что есть в macOS, например поддержка \\"жестов\\" для прилипания окон к краям экрана. Помимо изменения анимаций, для кастомизации интерфейса Windows и приближения его к виду macOS, вы также можете использовать различные темы, пакеты иконок и приложения для изменения интерфейса, такие как RocketDock или Nexus Dock (док-панели), Rainmeter (для добавления виджетов) и т. д. Следует отметить, что установка сторонних приложений и изменение системных настроек может повлиять на стабильность и производительность системы. Старайтесь использовать проверенное программное обеспечение и регулярно создавать точки восстановления перед внесением масштабных изменений в систему."},{"prompt":"Story prompt: A popular animated series has reached its 300th episode, and while many viewers of other series hate the idea of clip shows or recap episodes, this one was different. In the animated series, it was a world of gods, magic, monsters, heroes and villains, and during the beginning, only started with three main characters before the trio grew into a group of thirty. The recap episode aimed to show the previous events and story arcs, except have it be told by the characters, while making it seem like the full thirty had always been there, with the flashbacks often being interrupted due to the in-universe inconsistencies.","completion":"Title: \\"A Tale of Thirty\\" Once upon a time in the captivating animated world of \\"Mythos,\\" a show that had captivated audiences for years with its rich tapestry of gods, magic, monsters, heroes, and villains, something extraordinary was about to happen. The eagerly anticipated 300th episode was just around the corner, and the creators had a unique surprise in store for their dedicated viewers. Known for their disdain towards recap episodes, fans of other shows dreaded the thought of having to sit through endless flashbacks. However, \\"Mythos\\" was not your typical animated series. It had a distinctive charm, an endearing quirk that fans had come to love. In this world, the narrative began with just three main characters: Leon, the courageous warrior seeking justice; Tara, the enigmatic sorceress with a mysterious past, and Zephyr, the mischievous rogue known for his quick wit and light fingers. Over time, these three protagonists found themselves on a legendary journey, surrounded by an ever-growing ensemble of characters with their own unique story arcs. As the 300th episode drew near, excitement filled the air. It promised a celebration of the series' rich history, a chance for both newcomers and long-time fans to relish the journey they had embarked upon. The episode opened to an ornate hall where the original trio and their companions gathered. They stood in front of an enchanting artifact known as the \\"Stone of Tales.\\" This mystical stone possessed the power to transport them into the past, allowing them to revisit the events that led to their extraordinary adventures. One by one, the characters stepped forward, taking turns to narrate their encounters and expeditions. The screen would shimmer, and they would be transported to a vivid recreation of the past. However, as they began retelling their tales, amusing inconsistencies started creeping into the flashbacks. During Leon's flashback, he found himself fighting a towering monster on a cliff. But suddenly, the cliff vanished beneath their feet, and they found themselves engaged in an epic battle aboard a pirate ship instead. The scene shifted yet again, this time placing them in a tranquil meadow surrounded by brightly colored butterflies. Tara took her turn, recounting her magical exploits and ancient prophecies. Each time the flashback started, mischievous Zephyr would interrupt, delighting in causing chaos while the narrative transformed into absurdity. A dragon suddenly appeared wearing a fancy hat, and a majestic unicorn donned dark sunglasses. Intentional or not, the interruptions and inconsistencies brought laughter and joy to both the characters and the viewers. The flashbacks became an unorthodox medley of heartfelt moments, epic battles, and whimsical surprises. Yet, beneath the lightheartedness, the essence of the characters and their growth was not lost. Unbeknownst to the characters, the Stone of Tales had a mischievous spirit, imbuing their recollections with whimsy. It was an homage to the unpredictable nature of the mythical world they inhabited and a reminder that heroes and villains alike could be shaped by enchantment and unexpected turns. By the end of the episode, the characters returned to the present-day, reflecting on their shared journey and growth. Though the flashbacks may have been inconsistent, what remained constant was their bond as a united force against the darkness. \\"Mythos\\" had taken the concept of recap episodes and transformed it into a celebration of their varied and dynamic cast. It was a tribute to the viewers who had joined them on this incredible adventure and a testament to the enduring spirit of unity and camaraderie in the face of adversity. As the credits rolled, fans across the world applauded, laughing at the unpredictable and remarkable journey they had just experienced. The 300th episode of \\"Mythos\\" had undoubtedly left its mark, forever etched into the hearts of an adoring fan base that grew right alongside the cast of thirty. And thus, the tale of \\"Mythos\\" continued, forever entwined with the spirit of joy, wonder, and embrace of the unexpected."},{"prompt":"In a moment, I will be writing questions form the Morgan Stanley 2024 First Year Enhancement Program (New York) investment banking track interview.

Они стоят на пороге прорыва: создания вакцины для вечной жизни и молодости. • Научный отдел в восторге от открытия, в лаборатории царит атмосфера торжества. После успешной презентации их эксперимента над крысами, Эд и его жена возвращаются домой, чтобы отпраздновать успех. Шторм наступает: • Интимные моменты между Эдом и его женой дома. Они обсуждают планы на будущее, их романтическая встреча переходит в страстный вечер. • Когда после утро голые с обьятием жены в постели,и через некоторое время начинают звонить в телефон эда и сообщают что в вашем лаборотории что-то случилось не хорошее. • Радость прерывается известием о трагедии: инфицированная крыса умерла и восстала как зомби, сбежав из лаборатории и начав заражение города. • Пока Эд и его жена отдыхают, город погружается в хаос. Зомби-вирус быстро распространяется, затрагивая школы, больницы, улицы. Трагический перелом: • На следующее утро Эд и его жена возвращаются в лабораторию и обнаруживают сбежавшую крысу. Новости сообщают о массовом заражении. • Они пытаются дозвониться до детей и родственников, но безуспешно. Улицы заполнены зомби. Лаборатория осаждена толпой заражённых. • После нападения зомби, Эда укусили, и он принимает экспериментальную вакцину. Он вынужден покинуть свою жену, которая жертвует собой, чтобы спасти его. Ядерный удар: • Эд, полузомби, узнаёт о намерениях властей сбросить на город ядерную бомбу. С помощью своих новых способностей он прячется в подземном бункере. • Бомба стирает город с лица земли, уничтожая всех его обитателей, как живых, так и мёртвых. Акт 2: Развитие сюжета и персонажей Эд выходит на поверхность: • После взрыва Эд, один из немногих выживших, покидает своё убежище. Мир, который он знал, больше не существует. • Он встречает Бена, мальчика-сироту, выжившего в руинах города. Между ними завязывается необычная дружба. Выживание в разрушенном мире: • Эд и Бен ищут припасы и остатки цивилизации, стараясь выжить среди развалин и постоянной угрозы зомби. • По мере их путешествия за руинами, Эд начинает терять остатки своего человечества и борется с внутренними демонами. Акт 3: Кульминация и разрешение конфликта Шоу \\"Rundead\\": • Ханз Шоумастер, выживший продюсер, создаёт телешоу \\"Rundead\\" и похищает Бена, чтобы использовать его в качестве приза для Эда. • Эд, теперь полностью зомби, но сохранивший воспоминания о Бене, проходит через жестокие испытания шоу.

Yet tonight, I can’t shake off a sense of foreboding… ED wraps his arms around her waist, drawing her close. Their connection is as palpable as the air they breathe, their union strengthened by the challenges they’ve faced. ED (reassuringly) We’ve tread through the unknown, shaped the future. Any fear we feel is a reminder of our responsibility. They stand in shared silence, their gaze on the sprawling city below—a testament to humanity’s relentless advance. CUT TO: TWO SHOT - ED AND MARIA together, framed against the cityscape. Ed rests his chin on Maria’s shoulder, their reflections woven into the tapestry of lights. ED (softly) What matters now is that we navigate the path ahead with caution. For every miracle we’ve created, there’s a responsibility we can’t ignore. MARIA (turning to face him) Our dreams could become nightmares if we’re not careful. The joy of discovery, the weight of consequence—we carry them both. ED (nodding) Together, we’ll face whatever comes. Our love, our bond… it’s our anchor amidst the storm. They share a tender kiss, a moment of solace away from prying eyes and probing questions. It’s a promise, a vow unspoken but deeply felt—an acknowledgment of their unity and unwavering support for each other.

Ed, with deliberate solemnity, locks away classified materials—information that once promised a brighter future. ED (musing with a trace of sorrow) In our hands, we held the light of knowledge, the hope for mankind’s dawn… MARIA, with measured breath, crosses to join him, a consoling presence in the stillness of their created world. MARIA (voice quivering with resolve) And in our hearts, we’ll carry it still, through whatever lies ahead. This journey… our purpose… it doesn’t end here.

The car is a vessel adrift in the ocean of an uncertain future, the serenity an unsettling prelude to the sirocco of change. MARIA (softly, almost to herself) What have we done, Ed? The path we’ve chosen… ED (firmly, cutting the tension) …is the right one. Doubt can’t sway us now. We did it for the greater good, regardless of the cost. EXT. ED’S HOUSE - BACK PORCH - NIGHT The two of them, alone against the tapestry of the night sky, settle into a silence under the stars. The darkness is pierced by the soft flicker of candlelight. The porch, a haven in the eye of the storm, is where they find solace. MARIA (a murmur against the night’s whisper) May this peace last, against the tempest that looms. ED gathers MARIA in his arms, a fortress against the coming gale. ED (mutely determined) As long as we stand together, we’ll weather any storm. MARIA leans into ED, her beacon in the twilight.

Outside, a tapestry of stars battles the city’s fading luminescence, a visual symphony of light and dark mirrored in the weary yet hopeful eyes of our travelers. MARIA (softly, to Ed, with solemn warmth) The path we’ve carved today will shape a thousand tomorrows, entangling our fates with the arc of history. Their glance meets, a bridge of silence spanning between them, weighted with the burden of their creation. CUT TO: The sanctuary of their home awaits as they drift into the driveway. The car’s engine stills, surrendering to the quietude that wraps around them like a protective shroud.

They are nestled on a luxurious sofa that is the epitome of modern elegance, yet the room resonates with an old-world charm. A low table is the centerpiece of their intimate setup, decorated with a vibrant bouquet and the soft flicker of candlelight. An open bottle of red wine sits idle, exuding its bouquet into the room, while two glasses sit, their contents slowly savored. Maria finds solace in Ed’s embrace, her body drawn to his as they reflect on the day’s triumph and ponder their shared aspirations. MARIA (beaming with love for Ed) Imagine… we might be on the cusp of history, deciphering the riddle of agelessness.

The incessant RINGING of Ed’s phone slices through the silence—insistent, jarring. He stirs, but Maria nudges him towards the persistent invasion of their tranquility. MARIA (muffled against Ed’s neck) Honey… the phone… ED (grumbling) Let it ring… nothing is more important than this moment. But the phone is relentless. After several ignored calls, Ed finally relents. ED (sighing) Alright… alright… He reaches out, voice heavy with the remnants of sleep and satisfaction. ED (into the phone) Hello? The grave voice of a COLLEAGUE reverberates through the line, shattering the mussed warmth of their sanctuary. CUT TO: Split Screen: Ed’s expressions of ecstasy now contort to one of shock and disbelief. COLLEAGUE (V.O.) (urgent, panicked) Ed—it’s gone wrong.

Suddenly, an eerie scuffle breaks the stillness. On a deserted alleyway, a HOMELESS MAN huddles for warmth, unaware of the danger lurking. His eyes snap open, on edge, and fear takes hold as he spots several figures moving with an unsettling, lurching gait towards him. The ragged silhouettes grow clearer - zombies in various stages of decay. Wasting no time, the man scrambles to his feet, but his movements are sluggish, still dulled by sleep. He turns to flee, but the undead descend upon him with relentless hunger. His panicked screams shatter the silence of the night, a symphony of terror that marks the dawn of a new horror.

Immediate response needed… He realizes the helplessness of his position, the futility of calling for aid already too late for the unfortunate victim. His hand shakes as he switches off the monitor, the image of the undead’s assault burned into his memory.

SCIENCE CITY PARK - DAYBREAK The park, once a refuge of mirth, now stands ominously silent. A CHILD’S BIKE lies discarded on its side, the nearby swings creaking in the wind as if mourning the loss of laughter. A distant, guttural SCREAM pierces the morning air.

MARIA stands beside him, her hand finding his. Together they face the beginning of an apocalypse, their world irrevocably changed. MARIA (sound of steel in her voice) Let’s find that antidote, Ed. We owe it to everyone out there—and to ourselves. ED nods, the silence between them speaking volumes. They have become soldiers on the front line of a battle they never wanted. FADE TO: EXT. CITY - CONTINUOUS The morning sun does little to dispel the gloom that envelops the city.

GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURITY ROOM - DAY A flickering glow from multiple monitors lights the dim room. Ed and Maria, alongside their colleague DR. STEVENS, watch in horror as security footage replays the genesis of the calamity. The rat, previously lifeless on a metal table, convulses violently, its death-like stillness erupting into a grisly semblance of life. The creature’s rebirth is captured in grainy detail—a grotesque interruption in the sanitarium of science. DR. STEVENS (voice cracking) Look at it… nobody could have predicted this. It’s like a nightmare. ED (tight-jawed) We created a monster… Maria’s hand covers her mouth as she stifles a sob. The knowledge that their breakthrough is responsible for the terror gripping the city is an unbearable burden. MARIA (overwhelmed) Our children… are they… DR. STEVENS (interrupting, grim) I’ve been trying to reach the schools all morning. Communications are down city-wide. We don’t know who’s… who’s still alive. Ed slams a fist on the console in frustration, his rage a silent scream challenging the chaos. Maria turns to him, eyes pooling with tears—desperation etched on her face. MARIA (pleading) We have to do something, Ed! ED (resolute) And we will. We fix this. We find the cure and distribute it. No rest until this damn virus is eradicated from every last soul it’s touched. They stand united, a feeble bulwark against an abyss that threatens to consume the world they know. CUT TO: EXT. CITY - WIDE SHOT - DAY The camera pans over the once-bustling metropolis, now a ghost town. Silence hangs heavy, broken only by the occasional moan of the wandering undead or the distant cry of the still-living, hiding in the ruins. CUT TO: INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - RESEARCH WING - CONTINUOUS Ed and Maria, passing debris of their shattered ambitions, make their way to the sealed vault which houses their only hope—a cure. Dr. Stevens trails, clutching at his lab coat as if it were a lifeline. ED (urgent) Quickly, this way! They race down the hallway, their every step a deafening echo against the sterile walls. FADE OUT. END OF PAGE 27 OF 150 The tension ramps up as the narrative establishes the complete breakdown of normalcy, with Ed and Maria learning the depth of the catastrophe. Guilt, responsibility, and the pressure to fix their unintended outcome drive them.

ED’s gaze is fixated ahead, a steely resolve masking the dread within. Every shadow is a potential threat, every sound a harbinger of the undead. Suddenly, a guttural growl pierces the silence. Around the corner lumbers a group of zombies, their movements jerky and erratic. The sight is jarring, the realization of their nightmare fully manifest. MARIA (in a hushed tone) Ed… Without hesitation, ED takes the lead, signaling MARIA to stay behind him. Despite his scientific mind rebelling against the logic of their existence, his survival instincts kick in. They back away slowly, but the zombies advance with increasing hunger. The corridor’s confines amplify their mangled cries. Ed and Maria turn to run, but the creatures are relentless in pursuit. One of the zombies lunges forward, catching ED by the arm. Its teeth sink into his flesh—a searing pain that echoes with the unbearable finality of his fate. MARIA (screaming) Ed! She pulls Ed away with a strength born of desperation, dragging him toward a nearby reinforced door. They stumble through just in time, slamming it shut on their assailants. INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE ROOM - CONTINUOUS The couple slumps against the door, breathing heavily. Ed grunts as he clutches the wound, blood oozing between his fingers—a cruel testament to their perilous situation. MARIA (tearfully) It’s not deep, we can treat it. ED (panting, pain-ridden) Maria… I don’t have much time… MARIA (shaking her head) Don’t say that. We’ll find the antidote. We’ll… Ed gives a pained smile, his eyes reflecting both love and sorrow. ED (urgently) Listen to me. You need to continue without me. Find the cure, Maria. MARIA collapses beside him, the horror of the moment washing over her. The reality they tried to escape has consumed them, as the weight of their predicament settles like a shroud. FADE OUT.

GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE RESEARCH FACILITY - DAY The room buzzes with the subdued whirr of high-tech machinery. MARIA scrambles, her hands fumbling through vials and medical supplies, searching for anything that might save ED. He lies on a cot, his complexion growing paler, his breaths shallow. MARIA’s hands shake as she uncaps a vial labeled “Prototype Antidote 7A.” Desperation fills her eyes as she fills a syringe and turns to ED with steely determination. MARIA (breathlessly) Ed, this is experimental, but it’s based on our earlier research. It could save you. ED (weakly, but with a firm resolve) Do it… anything for a chance. Maria injects the contents into his arm. They wait, the seconds stretching into an eternity. Suddenly, Ed convulses, a guttural groan escaping his lips as his body reacts to the drug. MARIA (frantic) Hold on, Ed! Hold on! His convulsions slow, then stop. Slowly, his breathing steadies, and the color begins to return to his cheeks. Maria sighs with relief as she watches him, her own body sagging with exhaustion. ED (voice stronger) Maria… it’s working. I can feel it fighting the virus. MARIA collapses beside him, tears of relief streaming down her face. They embrace, a moment of hope amidst the terror that surrounds them. Suddenly, the door bursts open, ZOMBIES spill into the room, their groans filling the air with dread. With a surge of adrenaline, MARIA springs to her feet, seizing a nearby fire extinguisher. She sprays the advancing horde, her other hand grabbing Ed, pulling him towards an emergency exit. ED (urgently) Go, Maria! Get out of here! MARIA shakes her head, determination blazing in her eyes. MARIA (screaming) Not without you, Ed! Just as they reach the door, a ZOMBIE lunges, its teeth bared for Maria’s neck. In a split-second decision, Ed shoves her through the door, slamming it behind her, locking himself inside with the undead. MARIA (desperately pounding the door) ED! No! But Ed’s fate is sealed. As Maria sobs, slumped against the door, the sounds of the scuffle inside fade. A profound silence settles, and a new resolve takes hold. MARIA (vow in her voice) I’ll make it right, Ed. I’ll save them all. CUT TO: EXT. GENEsis LABORATORY - ROOFTOP HELIPAD - CONTINUOUS A helicopter approaches, the wind from its blades scattering papers and debris across the rooftop.

GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE RESEARCH FACILITY - DAY The sterile corridor is now a cacophony of terror. MARIA bears witness to ED’S transformation—skin deathly pale, veins blackening. With the shadow of zombification drawing near, he makes a drastic choice. ED (determined, to Maria) Go! Save our children… save everyone. With a mix of horror and fierce resolve, ED flings himself through the window, landing on the concrete below with an unnatural ferocity only the infected possess. Maria watches as Ed, now imbued with the strength and resilience of the undead but mercifully retaining his mind, staggers to his feet and storms into the city. CUT TO: EXT. CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS With the mind of a scientist but the body of a monster, ED trudges through the chaotic streets, an insatiable need to protect and a relentless drive to find their children fuelling his every step. MARIA, atop the helipad, is torn between following ED and escaping with the cure. Tears stream down her face as she calls out to him, though he can no longer hear her. MARIA (screaming into the void) I love you… I’ll find them, I promise! With the cries of her husband echoing in her ears, Maria vows to carry on their fight and save the city they love. She watches Ed disappear into the horde of zombies, a lone figure of tragedy amidst the devastation. The helicopter, hovering anxiously, becomes her only refuge. She climbs aboard, clutching the potential cure to her chest as they ascend into the maelstrom. CUT TO BLACK. INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE RESEARCH FACILITY - DAY Forcing herself to focus, Maria enters the lab again. The screen flickers to life, interfacing with her fierce intellect.

Her hands never waver, her eyes never stray. The readouts wink back at her with promising data, and the compound finally takes form—a vial shining with the hope of humanity. MARIA (declaration of war on the apocalypse) This is only the beginning. Run zombie, run. END OF PAGE 30 OF 150 PAGE 31 OF 150 EXT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - MORNING ED KAYNES, his body a mismatch of human fear and zombified resilience, slips through the shattered gates of what was once a sanctuary of learning. A tattered scarf partially conceals his grotesque features, signs of his incomplete transformation into the undead. Silently, he navigates the overgrown courtyard, each step deliberate to avoid drawing attention. Windows, dark and soulless, gape open like the eyes of the dead—witnesses to the devastation within. CUT TO: INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS Ed’s entry is a mirror to his internal chaos—a man, formerly a herald of progress, now reduced to a creature of instinct and desperation. His gait, once confident, is now a sober march into the unknown. He tiptoes past classrooms where silent echoes of children’s laughter are replaced by the somber reality of abandonment. Broken furniture and scattered papers litter the floor—a flashback to the day when life unraveled. A weak groan echoes down the hall as Ed pauses, a sideways glance revealing a lone zombie staggering between the desks of what used to be a third-grade classroom. Ed suppresses a shudder, steeling himself against the macabre scenery. He scans the empty, desolate rooms, searching for any sign of his children—backpacks, a stray drawing, a forgotten toy—anything that would offer a shred of hope. But the silence is the only answer. CUT TO: INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS Ed arrives at the gym, a cavernous hollow now home to dust and despair. Sunlight streams through broken skylights, carving shadows that pool like blood on the hardwood floor. He scans the rafters, a haunting tableau of memories and lost days playing out in the sunbeams. As real as the danger is, it’s the threat of finding irrevocable truth that tightens his chest—a father’s fear, potent even in undeath. But there’s no trace, no joyous clamor of children, no after-school exclamations. They’re gone, swept away by the cataclysm that swept through their lives like a malevolent tide. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS Ed emerges from the school, the line between man and zombie blurred by his faltering, heart-wrenching mission. Desolation repels hope like opposite poles of a tragic magnet. Torn by failure, Ed turns away from the forlorn landmark of his children’s laughter, now a crypt to his unspoken fear. His eyes, rimmed with the red of grief and infection, look beyond—towards the distant, fortified silhouette of his bunker. MONTAGE – ED’S JOURNEY TO THE BUNKER: - Ed’s shadow stretches along the cracked pavement as he trudges through the eerie streets, a spectral figure moving against the grain of desolation. - At intersections, he ducks into the shadows, avoiding the roving packs of zombies that cluster around the remnants of life—imperfect kin he no longer resembles. - The bunker’s hidden entrance, a sliver between the ruins, beckons—a sanctuary amid a city usurped by death. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS A blast door seals with an echo, enveloping Ed in the silence of his clandestine refuge. He peels away the scarf, revealing the visage of a man ensnared between two realities. Amid the quiet hum of survival equipment, Ed perches on the edge of a cot, hands clasped, elbows resting on his knees. He is the epitome of the isolated soul—lost in the chasm between the living and the not. Remnants of humanity nest in the bunker—photographs, clothes, a child’s crayon drawing affixed to a wall. Through the stillness, Ed’s rasping breath is a dissonant chorus, filling the void with his internal war. ED (muttering to himself) I’ll find them—alive or… I must. He rises, a gaunt figure against the backdrop of monitors flickering with disconnected surveillance feeds. With grim acceptance, he begins to arm himself for the world above, the haven below now a grave to his former self. END OF PAGE 31 OF 150 PAGE 32 OF 15 INT. ED’S BUNKER - WASHROOM - CONTINUOUS Ed stands, a tragic figure, before the worn mirror; his flesh sags and his eyes are pools of dread. Clusters of hair slip through his trembling fingers, each strand a part of his old self, relinquishing to the monster he is becoming. A gasp of despair chokes out as he beholds the naked scalp in the mirror, a stark declaration of his metamorphosis. Tears well up, spilling over, tracing grimy paths down his deformed cheeks. The bunker trembles, a distant cataclysm making the very earth weep. A shelf rattles and the few personal effects he’s salvaged from his previous life threaten to tumble and shatter. ED (Screaming, his voice a ragged echo of rage and fear) NOOOOO! NO!..NO! Overcome with grief, he slams a fist against the mirror, the crack spider-webbing across his fractured reflection. His knees buckle, and he sinks to the ground amidst the fallen hair—an island of agony in a sea of cold tile. His wails fill the cramped space, a chilling symphony to a soul in mourning. And in this moment of anguish, the bunker shakes—dust falling like ancient witnesses to his pain. Shelves rattle, threatening to topple, the explosion’s distant thunder a cruel reminder of the world falling apart above. Ed’s cries meld with the deep, seismic vibrations from outside, both the internal and external worlds crumbling in unison. In this fortress of solitude, his tether to sanity and solidarity grows dangerously thin. CUT TO: EXT.

CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS ED reels from the shockwave, his once stoic facade crumbling. The instruments and gauges surrounding him now mere spectators to his unraveling. ED (hoarse shout) What have we done?! He wrenches away from the mirror, stumbling as the ground continues to betray him. A shelf crashes down, its contents—a journal, a photo, remnants of the past—spill across the floor, a poignant reminder of life before the fall. CUT TO: EXT. CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS The aftermath of the explosion erupts into a chaotic torrent of action—civilian and military alike now share only the common goal of survival. AND CUT BACK TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS ED lunges for a two-way radio, the last line connecting him to the world he fought to save—a world that might no longer exist. His hand caresses the tuning knob, static filling the clean space of the bunker. His voice, modulated by desperation and the unearthly timbre of his new form, crackles into the void. ED (into the radio, desperate) Is anyone out there…? Children… Please… As the static answers back, heavy and relentless, the camera captures a final shot of ED—an echo of humanity caught in the purgatory between life and death. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 32 OF 150 PAGE 33 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The siren’s wail pierces the bunker’s thick silence, a banshee scream announcing impending doom.

BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS ED stands frozen, the epitome of desperation, as the last fragments of his world descend into chaos. He watches, powerless, as the skeletal outlines of his former life flicker on the screens. NEWS ANCHOR (ON MONITOR) (tense, authoritative) This is not a drill. Seek immediate shelter. A nuclear strike has been authorized and will commence within the hour. May God have mercy on us all. Ed’s eyes widen with horror at the anchor’s solemn decree. His fist clenches, shattering the radio’s silence. ED (into the radio, voice quivering) Not like this… Please, no… CUT TO: INT. SHELTER - DAY Families huddled together, their eyes glued to portable televisions broadcasting the final countdown. Tears mix with prayers, as they embrace for what could be the last time.

Every clank and hiss a harrowing step towards the inevitable. The camera follows his frantic actions, an intimate dance between man and machine, before pausing on his face—a visage caught between primal survival and heart-wrenching grief. ED (whispering to himself) Survive. Survive for what’s left… The bunker’s artificial lights flicker under the strain of the external world crumbling. Ed, a sentinel at the end of days, stares down the immensity of his solitude, the gravity of the moment heavy upon him. His raspy breath is the metronome to the ticking countdown, as the monitors’ once steadfast streams stutter—a digital heart rate faltering as the world prepares for its last beat. END OF PAGE 33 OF 150 PAGE 34 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The stubborn hum of outdated technology fills the air as ED hunches over the mainframe terminal of the bunker, his fingers a flurry over the backlit keys. The screen before him flashes with layers of security access prompts and firewalls, a digital labyrinth of his own design. Ed’s mind, a cocktail of desperation and scientific prowess, races to unlock the secrets he once safeguarded so fervently. With each override command, he peels back the digital veils shrouding his research, his city’s downfall, the truth. With a final keystroke, he breaches the mainframe security. The floodgates open, and data streams onto the monitor—classified communications, military intel, the command chain’s last orders, the enormity of the impending strike. ED (voice barely a whisper, laced with dread) Oh, what have we done… The screen maps out the grim reality—a schematized web showing the approaching missile’s trajectory, projected fallout patterns, and the bleakest scenarios outlined in stark numeric certainty. CUT TO: INT. MILITARY COMMAND BUNKER - DAY Generals hunch over radar screens, the forewarned cataclysm reflected in their stoic faces. Behind them, a wall-sized world map blinks with the Morse code of impending doom. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed’s horrified gaze traverses the information on-screen. His infected constitution wrestles with the gravity of what’s coming—ignited not by a zombie’s viral urges but by a man’s conscience and heart. ED (grappling with the scope of the cataclysm) There’s gotta be… there must be something else we can do… Anyone… He scans the screens for any sign of hope, a ceasefire, an alternative to the end. But the truth is unyielding, encoded in the logic of machines and strategic calculations. CUT TO: EXT. OBSERVATION POST - DAY A lone soldier stands sentinel, binoculars to his eyes, the distant whistle of the incoming missile harmonizing with the wail of the air raid sirens—a requiem for the world he knew. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed slams his palm against the terminal, the pain insignificant against his racing thoughts. Bitter laughter, a guttural sound devoid of humor, escapes him as he contemplates the irony—the mad scientist, the living dead, now the audience to Armageddon. ED (to himself, the laugh collapsing into a growl) We played with life and death… and now we pay the price. He rises, each movement a struggle as he opens a secure drawer, retrieving a dusty bottle of whiskey, a relic from a past life. He unscrews the cap and takes a swig, the burn a fleeting reminder of human sensations. Ed’s bloodshot eyes, tinged with yellow, fix on the countdown—a digital grim reaper ticking away the seconds of existence. FADE OUT: END OF PAGE 34 OF 150 PAGE 35 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker, once a bastion of safety, becomes a tomb as the hollow echoes of explosions reverberate through its concrete walls. ED stands still, the ghastly light of the monitors painting his face as each distant blast grows closer, louder, a chorus of annihilation gaining fervor.

The ventilation system churns violently, fighting against the onslaught of the inferno waiting outside. Each detonation outside is a gut punch to the facility, the sound magnified by the silence it disrupts. Flickering screens cast erratic shadows across the walls, creating an ominous dance of light that foreshadows the end. ED (voice choked with dread) This is how it ends… Not with a whimper, but with a bang. CUT TO: INT.

Children clutch their parents, eyes wide and uncomprehending, as the reverberations of the unthinkable shake their sanctuary. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS Ed slumps into his seat, resigned, the bottle slipping from his grip and rolling across the floor. The world outside may be ending, but his torment continues unabated—a curse of the undead. A single tear—unclear if it’s from sorrow or the zombie affliction—trails down his face. He watches the countdown dwindle; humanity’s tenure ticking away before his crypt-colored eyes. FADE OUT: END OF PAGE 35 OF 150 PAGE 36 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker convulses as if gripped by an unseen giant, the roar of the impact wave a deafening crescendo punctuating the still air. ED is launched from his chair, thrown to the unforgiving floor as the earth itself seems to spiral into chaos.

The once orderly rows of canned goods and emergency provisions cascade onto the now-tilting floors. B. Water pipes burst, geysers erupting in formerly dry rooms, while electrical sparks create a dangerous light show. C. A portrait of Ed’s family, clinging to the wall, now slips free and crashes to the ground, the glass protecting their smiles shattering. BACK TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed, crawling through the mayhem, reaches for the bunker’s emergency protocols—a last-ditch hope to seal away the cataclysm that hunts for him within his sanctuary. Lights flicker overhead, many winking out, as the integrity of their fixtures fail. He hits the master lockdown button, and with a metallic groan, reinforced doors slide shut, drowning the chaos into muffled fury. The sanctuary becomes sarcophagus. Over the din of destruction, Ed’s distorted cry resonates—half man, half beast, all despair. ED (screaming above the noise) Survive! I must… survive… The camera pulls out from the scene, leaving Ed a solitary, writhing figure amidst the anarchy that ensnares him—an amalgam of man’s hubris and the savage grip of nature’s retribution, locked in a bunker, locked in turmoil. FADE OUT: END OF PAGE 36 OF 150 PAGE 37 OF 150 INT.

His limbs, misshapen by his condition and shaken by the concussive forces, push against the tiles with a strength born from the darkest depths of survival instinct. Grit and dust cake his flesh as he labors for breath, a horrifying rasp that competes with the bunker’s groans and the distant, thunderous booms that refuse to fade away. Pain lances through him; whether from the fall, the shockwaves, or his own internal transformation, it’s impossible to tell. But it fuels him, drives him—the agony a reminder of life amidst a landscape that speaks only of annihilation. CUT TO: EXT. CITY RUINS - SAME MOMENT A cloud of dust and debris blankets the horizon where the city once teemed with life. The singular fury of the initial blast has given birth to countless offspring—sporadic eruptions that devour the remnants of a world now confined to memory and echoes. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed gasps, his body hauled up to an unsteady crouch, fingertips white-knuckled as they grip a shattered piece of the console for support. Desperation swims in his eyes—a cocktail of torment, the will to endure, the knowledge that to succumb now is to surrender to the void. He scans the room through the haze, sees the sealed blast doors, the blinking red of systems barely clinging to function. In this stolen pause, where death seems to have drawn in a breath, Ed finds a semblance of order amidst the tumult. ED (voice a raspy whisper tinged with determination) Not yet… Not today… Tremors wrack his form, but they cannot break the spirit that fuels his battered frame. This bunker, this grave, this womb—it will not be his terminus. With a shake of his head, Ed stands fully, a testament to defiance. His cries subside to murmurs, to mantras of survival that carry him forward—a symphony played against the thunderous backdrop of the world’s end. FADE TO BLACK: END OF PAGE 37 OF 150 PAGE 38 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker’s foundation rattles under the relentless assault, dust cascading like tiny waterfalls from the ceiling. ED, half-zombie, stands amidst a glistening coat of sweat and grime, swaying unevenly as the earth beneath him convulses. He fixates on the emergency lighting, its flickering a spasmodic dirge to the rhythm of apocalypse, his mind racing with primal urgency. Every painful breath is a struggle, drowning in a sea of helplessness and confusion. His flesh, marked both by the zest of the undead and the scars of scientific torment, stretches over his hands as if trying to flee from the bone. His ashen lips mutter a garbled prayer to loved ones lost to either fate or the flame. Ed staggers forward, a mote of dust in the grim tableau of his sanctuary. He salvages a heavy crowbar from the scattered arsenal of survival tools. Its heft gives him a grotesque sense of purpose—a weapon against the barriers that cage him. Footsteps echo with thunderous intent, resonating upon the metal floor, as he assumes the stance of one prepared to battle titans. With a grunt, he wedges the crowbar into the seams of a heavy looking hatch, muscles and sinews bulging in grotesque relief against his lab coat. The strain reddens his eyes, fueling veins with an unnerving fervor. Gritted teeth are bared, the intonation of pained struggle filling the space, as he channels every ounce of his monstrous strength into the task. The metal groans, protesting, as if the very bunker itself is aware of Ed’s unwinnable war against time. With each incremental victory of leverage, the raw scrape of crowbar against hatch is a requiem for reason, a siren call of the myriad dead and dying above. ED (straining, a whisper to himself) Survive, protect, endure… No matter the cost. A sudden lurch, and the hatch gives way, surrendering to Ed’s determination with a scream of yielding steel. A dim shaft of light, alien in the confines of the bunker, pierces the grimy air—a fragile thread leading back to the chaos of a once familiar world. Ed, panting, a line of blood trickling from where the crowbar had slipped, rights himself—a ghastly architect of his own salvation or doom, straddling two realms he never wished to know. The bunker stands defiant, its heart now exposed. And as the camera zooms out, Ed, the anomaly, reaches toward the beckoning light—a specter grappling with the very essence of existence and annihilation. FADE TO BLACK.

A vast wasteland of destruction stretches before him, the cityscape now a twisted shadow of its former self. The ground, littered with debris and the remnants of buildings, challenges every step. Yet Ed advances, his silhouette a stark contrast against the backdrop of a demolished city. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Back inside the shaking bunker, Ed’s hands move with purpose, fueled by an unyielding instinct for survival and protection. He scans the room, now a collapsed chamber of his former life, searching for anything that will aid his escape. He spots his toolbox, hurled by the tremors to a corner. Within lies a collection of tools, each associated with a memory of maintenance and preparedness, each now essential for a far grimmer purpose. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED STREET - CONTINUOUS Ed navigates the treacherous terrain. He grips a robust pipe wrench, repurposed now as a cudgel to fend off the encroaching undead and clear his path of obstacles. His movements are mechanical, devoid of the finesse of the living but driven by a persistent will that seems almost alien in these ruins. Each swing of the wrench is a statement of defiance, a claim to life in a realm of death. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS Ed approaches a mound of rubble where a building once stood. Determination etches his features as he sets about methodically removing pieces of concrete and twisted metal. With each thrust and pry of his makeshift tools, he paves a way through the destruction. His movements are heavy but precise, the products of a mind that refuses to surrender to defeat. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED OVERPASS - CONTINUOUS Ahead lies the skeletal remains of what was once a vital overpass, its concrete bones a grim parody of the city’s past prosperity. Ed braces himself and climbs, his upheaved hands finding cracks and purchase among the debris. His progress is slow and arduous, but the sight of the overpass’s peak, a symbol of hope, spurs him onward. CUT TO: EXT. CITYSCAPE - HIGH ANGLE - CONTINUOUS Ed reaches the summit of the overpass and pauses, his gaze sweeping over the horizon. The wreckage stretches as far as the eye can see, but this height gives perspective—there is a path to be forged, a direction to take. He takes a deep breath, the air a mingled scent of dust and destruction, and raises his wrench high. It’s a gesture of both challenge and resolve, a signal that his journey through this nightmare has only just begun. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 39 OF 150 PAGE 40 OF 150 EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - DAY ED’s lone figure is dwarfed by the gaping wound of the city. His every step is a testament to his unshakable resolve. The wrench, now an extension of his will, pierces the rubble blocking his path. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSED SUBWAY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS Ed approaches the maw of a collapsed subway entrance. Sunlight pierces through the cracks, casting slivers of light that dance on the mangled steel and broken tiles. With each piece of debris he removes, the way forward becomes clearer. He works in silence, his breaths and the sound of falling concrete the only interruptions in the deathly quiet. CUT TO: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS The darkness of the tunnel envelops Ed as he descends. The beam from his makeshift torch, fashioned from a rag and salvaged alcohol, flickers against the walls, throwing exaggerated shadows around him. He navigates the shattered remains of the underground with a mixture of zombie-like indifference and human caution, the two natures merged into one being, surviving by instinct and intellect. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS Ed emerges onto the cracked surface of a highway, once a vein pulsing with life, now a silent artery in a dead metropolis. He takes a moment to scan the expanse for movement, for any sign of those like him or worse. Empty cars stand as monuments to a sudden catastrophe, their doors agape, their stories untold. CUT TO: INT. CRUSHED CAR - CONTINUOUS Ed peers through the window of a half-collapsed vehicle. Inside, a skeleton grips the steering wheel, a stark reminder of society’s abrupt end. For a moment, Ed sees himself—not so different from the bones. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - OVERLOOK - CONTINUOUS Climbing atop a pile of rubble that offers a vantage point, Ed scans the horizon. His heart, whatever is left of it, aches. The city lies in ruins, but amidst the desolation, there is a faint echo of hope—a whisper of life. CUT TO: EXT. NARROW CREVICE BETWEEN BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS Ed finds a narrow passageway, wedged between two faltering skyscrapers. The space is tight, claustrophobic, but the fresh air beckoning from the other side is unmistakable—a breath of the world beyond. He squeezes through the gap, the walls scraping against his flesh, now so foreign to pain. As he emerges, the air hits him like a wave of the past. It’s tinged with the acrid scent of smoke and decay, yet underneath it all is the undeniable smell of survival. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - CONTINUOUS Ed stands at the threshold of the crevice, the firmament open before him. He takes a long, deep breath, feeling the air churn within his lungs—half-life, half-death. A resolve settles deep within his marrow. He steps forward, leaving the shadows behind. Ahead, the path is fraught with ruin and remembrance, but it is his to tread. With the wrench slung over his shoulder, Ed sets out into the sunlit devastation, a figure of determination silhouetted against the crumbling silhouette of a fallen world. FADE OUT.

So, Judy and Nick groggily get out of bed, take a few steps, and immediately collapse from exhaustion. Mickey Mouse, who runs all Disney movies, begins to complain about Judy and Nick's failure to get ready, and ends up sending bootleg versions of Judy and Nick to arrest Duke. After Duke is arrested, Bootleg!Judy and Bootleg!Nick end up realizing that they, bootleg movie characters, ended up arresting somebody for selling bootleg movies, and end up laughing so hard from the irony that they collapse","completion":"Title: Midnight Mayhem in Zootopia One uneventful night in the bustling concrete burrows of Zootopia, the city's prime crime-fighting duo, Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde, were snuggled comfortably in their respective beds. Dreams of carrot fields and sly fox shenanigans danced through their heads. Unfortunately, the bliss of slumber would not last. As the echoes of the midnight moon loomed over the city, a call came crashing through the static of the police radio. \\"Officers Hopps and Wilde,\\" came Chief Bogo's gruff voice, sounding even gruffer at this unsightly hour. \\"We've got a 10-31: Duke Weaselton is on the loose, peddling bootleg movies like hotcakes. I need you on his tail, pronto!\\" Rubbing the sleep from their eyes, Judy and Nick stumbled out of bed, heavy with the drowsy weight of interrupted dreams. Their first steps teetered with the grace of newborn fauns, and within moments, the pair crumpled into an exhausted heap on the floor. From within the shadows, the legendary figure Mickey Mouse watched with dismay. Being in charge of the integrity of Disney movies was no small feat, and with Zootopia's top cops down for the count, drastic measures had to be taken. \\"Oh, boy!\\" Mickey exclaimed, rummaging through the Disney vault. The mouse plucked a pair of peculiar figures from the shelves—a pair of less-than-perfect action figures of Judy and Nick—and with a sprinkle of magic and a wish upon a star, Bootleg!Judy and Bootleg!Nick were brought to life! With a mold-mismatched grin and shoddily painted badge, Bootleg!Judy rallied her determination, while Bootleg!Nick adjusted his crooked tie and tipped his fedora. The bootleg duo set off into the night, a tangible determination within their knockoff threads. It wasn't long before the bootleggers' bizarre antics alarmed even the slickest of weasels. Duke Weaselton, caught red-handed with suitcases full of \\"Floatzen 2\\" and \\"Paw Wars,\\" stared in disbelief as his captors hustled him away. \\"You've gotta be kidding me,\\" Duke muttered as he squinted at them. \\"I'm getting nicked by faux fox and rabbit?\\" Back at the precinct, as the knockoff Judy and Nick presented Duke, the bootleg cuffs clicked closed, and Chief Bogo merely shook his head with a bemused snort. But, as the book of irony would have it, as soon Bootleg!Judy and Bootleg!Nick began to comprehend the situation, a fit of laughter overtook them. \\"We're counterfeit cops,\\" snickered Bootleg!Judy, \\"who just busted a bootleg bandit.\\" The irony was too much, the humor too rich. Their laughter spiraled into a cacophony of hilarious hyena-like howls that resonated throughout the precinct. The pair slapped their knees and tumbled over, collapsing alongside their real-life counterparts in paroxysms of mirth. Somewhere in the distance, the real Judy Hopps and Nick Wilde, still half enveloped in sleep, cracked one eye open each, vaguely aware of the peculiar ruckus. They shared a silent, sleepy chuckle before surrendering once more to their dreams, leaving justice in the capable, albeit slightly irregular, hands of their bootleg selves for just one more night. The city of Zootopia rested easy, under the watch of all its guardians, genuine or otherwise."},{"prompt":"Entering a string You need to sort the input string by word length, and then output the sorted string.

При top-p = 1, алгоритм рассматривает все слова, не взирая на их вероятность, и теоретически все слова могут быть выбраны. При более низких значениях top-p выборка сосредоточится на более узком наборе самых вероятных слов. - **Temperature:** Этот параметр используется для контроля степени случайности в выборке слов. Когда temperature равно 1, выборка слов происходит согласно их вероятностям безо всяких искажений. Если значение меньше 1, модель будет генерировать более предсказуемый текст, предпочитая более вероятные слова. Если значение больше 1, выбор станет более случайным и разнообразным. Таким образом, когда top-p равно 1, а temperature тоже равно 1, это значит, что при генерации ответа модель будет учитывать все возможные слова и выбирать их пропорционально их вероятности.

В контексте моделей языка, таких как GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer), параметры “top-p” (или nucleus sampling) и “temperature” используются для управления случайностью и разнообразием генерируемого текста. - Top-p (nucleus sampling): Это метод выборки слов, который сосредоточен на выборе из самых вероятных слов. При top-p = 1, алгоритм рассматривает все слова, не взирая на их вероятность, и теоретически все слова могут быть выбраны. При более низких значениях top-p выборка сосредоточится на более узком наборе самых вероятных слов. - Temperature: Этот параметр используется для контроля степени случайности в выборке слов. Когда temperature равно 1, выборка слов происходит согласно их вероятностям безо всяких искажений. Если значение меньше 1, модель будет генерировать более предсказуемый текст, предпочитая более вероятные","completion":"слова, и, наоборот, если значение больше 1, модель будет генерировать более случайный и творческий текст, чаще выбирая менее вероятные слова. Когда top-p (nucleus sampling) установлено в 1, это скорее всего означает, что в процессе генерации текста модель рассматривает весь словарь слов, но выбирает следующее слово, основываясь на их распределении вероятностей. Такой подход к выборке может привести к более случайным и непредсказуемым результатам, поскольку все слова имеют хотя бы небольшой шанс быть выбранными, несмотря на их низкую вероятность в данном контексте. Температура (temperature), установленная в 1, гарантирует, что вероятности слов не искажаются и что выборка слова производится пропорционально этим вероятностям. Это означает, что модель будет выбирать следующее слово из распределения, где более вероятные слова выбираются чаще, но менее вероятные слова все еще имеют шанс быть выбранными. Общая идея этих двух параметров - дать пользователям инструменты для манипулирования тем, насколько детерминированным или стохастическим будет текст, сгенерированный моделью. Использование различных значений для температуры и top-p может быть полезно для различных применений, например, если нужно создать более оригинальный и творческий текст или наоборот, более согласованный и ожидаемый текст. Комбинирование этих двух параметров позволяет тонко настраивать результаты генерации текста для достижения разнообразных целей."},{"prompt":"- Temperature: 1. Как вы думаете стоит ли этот параметр понизить до минимума для написания болле хороших сценариев?","completion":"Установка температуры (temperature) на значение 1 в модели языка, такой как GPT, означает, что слова выбираются согласно их распределению вероятностей. При понижении этого параметра до значения, близкого к 0, модель будет склонна генерировать более предсказуемый и согласованный текст. Это может быть полезно для сценариев, где требуется чёткая и последовательная нарративная структура. Понижение температуры до минимума приведёт к следующим изменениям в генерировании текста: 1. Повышение предсказуемости: Модель будет выбирать слова с наивысшей вероятностью, что может привести к менее творческим, но более логично связанным и когерентным фразам. 2. Уменьшение творческого разнообразия: С низкой температурой модель будет менее склонна к экспериментированию с разными словами и фразами, что может сделать сценарий менее уникальным и менее творческим. 3. Потенциал для повторения: Когда температура очень низкая, существует риск, что модель начнёт повторять одни и те же слова или фразы, так как она всегда будет выбирать наиболее вероятные варианты. При написании сценариев вы можете начать с более низкой температуры, чтобы обеспечить более структурированный и цельный текст, а затем постепенно увеличивать её для введения элементов творчества и разнообразия, где это уместно. Процесс творчества иногда требует баланса между предсказуемостью и новизной, поэтому оптимальное значение может отличаться в зависимости от конкретных задач и предпочтений писателя."},{"prompt":"а параметр top-p оставить как есть?","completion":"Значение параметра top-p (nucleus sampling), установленное равным 1, означает, что в процессе выбора следующего слова рассматриваются все возможные слова, и каждое слово имеет шанс быть выбранным в соответствии со своей вероятностью. Это обеспечивает максимальное разнообразие генерируемого текста, но может также приводить к тому, что модель иногда выбирает менее релевантные или неожиданные слова. Если вашей целью является написание хорошо структурированных сценариев с высокой связностью текста, возможно, вам стоит рассмотреть возможность уменьшения значения top-p. Устанавливая top-p меньше 1, вы ограничите выборку следующего слова лишь самым вероятным подмножеством слов, что может сделать текст более согласованным и последовательным. Вот что произойдет при установке более низкого значения top-p: 1. Меньше сюрпризов в тексте: Уменьшив top-p, вы уменьшите шансы на то, что модель выберет слова, которые могут быть непредсказуемыми или не имеют сильной связи с текущим контекстом. 2. Большая согласованность: Сосредоточившись на наиболее вероятных словах, модель будет создавать тексти с более высокой частотой ожидаемых и надёжных фраз, что способствует созданию более последовательного повествования. 3. Потенциальное снижение творчества: С уменьшением top-p вероятность подачи уникальных и творческих предложений уменьшается, поскольку модель становится менее склонной к риску в выборе слов. Поэтому, если вы хотите написать более качественные и структурированные сценарии, можно экспериментально подбирать значение top-p в диапазоне от 0.9 до 0.5 или даже меньше, в зависимости от желаемого уровня творчества и необычности текста. Начните с более высокого значения и постепенно уменьшайте его, пока не достигнете желаемого баланса между связностью и оригинальностью."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

В этой игре, Эд участвует в гротескном телешоу, созданном человеком по имени Ханз Шоумастер. Шоу называется \\"Rundead\\", где Эд должен пройти через серию зловещих препятствий и испытаний, чтобы в конце концов встретиться с Беном. Полный сюжет фильма \\"RUN ZOMBIE, RUN\\": Акт 1: Введение в мир и персонажей Открытие фильма: • Фильм начинается в мирное время, в современном научном городе, где жизнь кипит и наука бурлит. • Эд – талантливый учёный, занятый исследованиями в области биотехнологий вместе со своей женой и коллегами. Они стоят на пороге прорыва: создания вакцины для вечной жизни и молодости. • Научный отдел в восторге от открытия, в лаборатории царит атмосфера торжества. После успешной презентации их эксперимента над крысами, Эд и его жена возвращаются домой, чтобы отпраздновать успех. Шторм наступает: • Интимные моменты между Эдом и его женой дома. Они обсуждают планы на будущее, их романтическая встреча переходит в страстный вечер. • Когда после утро голые с обьятием жены в постели,и через некоторое время начинают звонить в телефон эда и сообщают что в вашем лаборотории что-то случилось не хорошее. • Радость прерывается известием о трагедии: инфицированная крыса умерла и восстала как зомби, сбежав из лаборатории и начав заражение города. • Пока Эд и его жена отдыхают, город погружается в хаос. Зомби-вирус быстро распространяется, затрагивая школы, больницы, улицы. Трагический перелом: • На следующее утро Эд и его жена возвращаются в лабораторию и обнаруживают сбежавшую крысу. Новости сообщают о массовом заражении. • Они пытаются дозвониться до детей и родственников, но безуспешно. Улицы заполнены зомби. Лаборатория осаждена толпой заражённых. • После нападения зомби, Эда укусили, и он принимает экспериментальную вакцину. Он вынужден покинуть свою жену, которая жертвует собой, чтобы спасти его. Ядерный удар: • Эд, полузомби, узнаёт о намерениях властей сбросить на город ядерную бомбу. С помощью своих новых способностей он прячется в подземном бункере. • Бомба стирает город с лица земли, уничтожая всех его обитателей, как живых, так и мёртвых. Акт 2: Развитие сюжета и персонажей Эд выходит на поверхность: • После взрыва Эд, один из немногих выживших, покидает своё убежище. Мир, который он знал, больше не существует. • Он встречает Бена, мальчика-сироту, выжившего в руинах города. Между ними завязывается необычная дружба. Выживание в разрушенном мире: • Эд и Бен ищут припасы и остатки цивилизации, стараясь выжить среди развалин и постоянной угрозы зомби. • По мере их путешествия за руинами, Эд начинает терять остатки своего человечества и борется с внутренними демонами. Акт 3: Кульминация и разрешение конфликта Шоу \\"Rundead\\": • Ханз Шоумастер, выживший продюсер, создаёт телешоу \\"Rundead\\" и похищает Бена, чтобы использовать его в качестве приза для Эда. • Эд, теперь полностью зомби, но сохранивший воспоминания о Бене, проходит через жестокие испытания шоу. Финальная битва и трагедия: • Эд освобождает Бена, но внезапно теряет остатки человечности и атакует его, не в силах сопротивляться своему зомби-инстинкту. • Бен превращается в зомби, и они уходят вместе, оставляя мир во власти хаоса и зомби-апокалипсиса. Заключение: • Фильм заканчивается на тёмной ноте. Эд и Бен, теперь оба зомби, сидят на разрушенном мосту, смотря на новый мир, который никогда не будет таким, каким был когда-то. Фильм \\"RUN ZOMBIE, RUN\\" показывает темную сторону человеческой изобретательности и последствия игры с природой. Со смешанными чувствами ужаса и сочувствия зрители следят за путешествием Эда от великого открытия до конечного падения в бездну живых мертвецов. Саундтреки будут браться из оригинальной игры BEN AND ED (2015 года) Дополнительные саундтреки: 1. Песня Yota - The Runner, финальная сцена, где зомби ED будет бежать c предпринимателем HANZ SHOWMASTER который создал величайшее в мире шоу и будут преодолевать препятствии. Зомби ЭД столкнет HANZ SHOWMASTER c площадки и он умирает. 2. Песня The Cranberries - Zombie, сцена, где весь механизм вышел из под контроля, испытания стали чрезвычайно сложными, и люди которые смотрят это шоу начинают убегать от атаков зомби. Время продолжает заканчиваться и платформа в очень скором времени падает в лаву. Зомби ED берет в себя в руки и начинает быстро преодолевать все препятствия под эту песню за одну минуту, пока время полностью не истекало. Последние секунды заканчивается и платформа начинает падать в лаву. ED перепрыгивает из платформы и ухватывается руками на землю. А дальше он старается подняться из земли, чтобы не упасть в раскаленную лаву.

Описание мира и введение Эда (5 страниц): Часть 1: Описание мира (Первая страница) Экстерьер. Научный городок. День. Первый план даёт визуальный обзор современного научного города, где здания усеяны солнечными панелями и зелеными крышами, а улицы наполнены как профессиональными учёными, так и студентами. Камера ненадолго останавливается на информационных табло, транслирующих последние научные достижения. Звуковой фон наполнен смесью городской суеты и приглушённой атмосферой исследовательских центров. Часть 2: Введение главного героя Эда (Вторая страница) Интерьер. Лаборатория Эда. День. Камера плавно переходит внутрь одного из исследовательских центров, где в главной роли — Эд, сосредоточенный учёный средних лет, одет в лабораторный халат. Он изучает данные на экране монитора и записывает что-то в блокнот. Вокруг — атрибуты научного занятия: микроскопы, колбы с различными реагентами, жужжание оборудования. Его коллеги в фоне занимаются собственными исследованиями. Часть 3: Эда хвалят за работу (Третья страница) Интерьер. Конференц-зал. День. Эд выступает перед коллегами и представителями научного сообщества, гордо демонстрируя результаты экспериментов — здоровую, активную крысу в стеклянном контейнере. Овация.

MARIA (sincere) You know, this breakthrough, it’s not just ours—it’s humanity’s. But tonight, let’s just be Ed and Maria, not scientists, not pioneers. Just… us. Ed nods, grateful for the solitude and sanctuary of their bond. As they clink glasses, the collected memorabilia of their careers—the articles, letters, awards—are merely shadows to the reality of them, here and now, together. Their laughter fades as they draw close, the rest of the evening dedicated to a celebration for two. Every lingering touch and shared smile is a world apart from their public personas—a declaration of love in a quiet act of rebellion against the pace of their lives. A soft melody drifts, an analog record player spinning a tune that seems composed for moments such as this. Ed and Maria rise, joining in an intimate dance—a slow, gentle sway, as if the notes themselves guide their movements. ED (softly, into her hair) Forget the breakthrough, the cure, the fame. You’re the real miracle in my life. Maria responds, her hand clasping tighter to his. MARIA (voice barely above a whisper) And you are my constant, through every success and every unknown. As they linger in the embrace of the dance, the world beyond the curtains continues to turn, unaware of the risk drawn from the very elixir of life they’ve concocted. But for now, for Ed and Maria, time stands still, the storm can wait, and love remains unchallenged. FADE OUT.

On a solitary display, the security footage is stark against the sterile backdrop. A rat, motionless in its cage mere hours ago, now twitches erratically - life electrifying death, its eyes aflame with a resurgence that defies nature. EDWARD “ED” KAYNES watches via a remote link from his safehouse, his face a mix of horror and disbelief. His fingers hover over the keyboard, hesitant to accept what unfolds before him. INSERT - MONITOR FOOTAGE The rat rises, a Frankenstein’s creature reborn. It frenzies against the confines of its cage, a tiny titan testing the mettle of man’s creation.

GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURITY HUB - NIGHT A sea of monitors casts a haunting blue light over the room. The NIGHT-SHIFT SECURITY GUARD, wide-eyed, frantically types at his console, a symphony of alarms demanding his attention. In the corner, a MONITOR reveals a lone rat in its enclosure — motionless, then SUDDENLY STIRRING. The impossible movement catches the guard’s eye. SECURITY GUARD (muttering under his breath) This can’t be… His hand hovers over the PANIC BUTTON, sweat beading on his brow, a moment’s hesitation before he slams his palm down. ALARM BLARES. CUT TO: INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - CONTAINMENT AREA - CONTINUOUS The rat twitches violently, RESURRECTING with each convulsion. A grotesque parody of life as the sterile blue light flickers ominously overhead. The creature SMASHES against the glass enclosure, the SOUND echoing down empty corridors. CUT TO: EXT.

END OF PAGE 21 OF 150 PAGE 22 OF 150 EXT. SCIENCE CITY STREETS - PRE-DAWN The city rests under a veil of darkness. Streetlights flicker as the first hints of morning struggle to penetrate a growing, unnatural fog. A sense of dread permeates the desolate urban landscape. Suddenly, an eerie scuffle breaks the stillness. On a deserted alleyway, a HOMELESS MAN huddles for warmth, unaware of the danger lurking. His eyes snap open, on edge, and fear takes hold as he spots several figures moving with an unsettling, lurching gait towards him. The ragged silhouettes grow clearer - zombies in various stages of decay. Wasting no time, the man scrambles to his feet, but his movements are sluggish, still dulled by sleep. He turns to flee, but the undead descend upon him with relentless hunger. His panicked screams shatter the silence of the night, a symphony of terror that marks the dawn of a new horror.

GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURITY ROOM - CONTINUOUS The night-shift SECURITY GUARD, wide-eyed, stares at the gruesome scene through his bank of monitors. Shaken to his core, he reaches for the radio, his voice quivering as he reports the incident. SECURITY GUARD (into radio, voice trembling) We have an attack in progress… Sector 5, west alleyway. Immediate response needed… He realizes the helplessness of his position, the futility of calling for aid already too late for the unfortunate victim. His hand shakes as he switches off the monitor, the image of the undead’s assault burned into his memory. To his horror, he understands that this solitary incident is but the precursor to a city-wide nightmare. The zombies are free, and Science City is their hunting ground. CUT TO: EXT.

The horror outside is now their cross to bear, their breakthrough their penance – and as DAYBREAK ushers in the first light, the first step in a relentless battle for redemption is taken. CUT TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 22 OF 150 PAGE 23 OF 150 INT. CITY HOSPITAL - DAWN Slivers of morning light offer no hope, instead illuminating a tableau of chaos. MEDICAL STAFF dash from bed to bed, desolation etched into their faces as they face the inevitable. DR. MARTINEZ, her eyes showing the night’s toll, marshals her team like a battlefield commander. DR. MARTINEZ (shouting over the cacophony) Move the critical cases to isolation! Now! Orderlies hurry by, pushing a gurney with a PATIENT whose twitching betrays the infection’s advance. CUT TO: EXT. SCIENCE CITY PARK - DAYBREAK The park, once a refuge of mirth, now stands ominously silent. A CHILD’S BIKE lies discarded on its side, the nearby swings creaking in the wind as if mourning the loss of laughter. A distant, guttural SCREAM pierces the morning air. Behind a line of trees, a FIGURE stumbles through the underbrush — not a jogger, but something distorted and terrifying. CUT TO: INT. EMERGENCY BROADCAST STATION - DAY A static-filled screen becomes clear, capturing the ANXIOUS FACE of a NEWS ANCHOR.

The cure… MARIA (hands clenching) We’ll get it, Ed. We have to. Their resolve is a beacon of hope amid the disarray. CUT TO: EXT. CITY HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS The HOSPITAL, its beacon-like quality diminished under the encroaching doom, becomes a FORTRESS against the affliction. Medics and security hustle to lock down the perimeter as more AMBULANCES roll in, a never-ending procession of despair. The CAMERA rises, offering a bird’s eye view of the city, a METROPOLIS succumbing to an unseen assailant. Yet through the struggle and fear, the raw determination of its people stands defiant.

MARIA stands beside him, her hand finding his. Together they face the beginning of an apocalypse, their world irrevocably changed. MARIA (sound of steel in her voice) Let’s find that antidote, Ed. We owe it to everyone out there—and to ourselves. ED nods, the silence between them speaking volumes. They have become soldiers on the front line of a battle they never wanted. FADE TO: EXT. CITY - CONTINUOUS The morning sun does little to dispel the gloom that envelops the city.

GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURITY ROOM - DAY A flickering glow from multiple monitors lights the dim room. Ed and Maria, alongside their colleague DR. STEVENS, watch in horror as security footage replays the genesis of the calamity. The rat, previously lifeless on a metal table, convulses violently, its death-like stillness erupting into a grisly semblance of life. The creature’s rebirth is captured in grainy detail—a grotesque interruption in the sanitarium of science. DR. STEVENS (voice cracking) Look at it… nobody could have predicted this. It’s like a nightmare. ED (tight-jawed) We created a monster… Maria’s hand covers her mouth as she stifles a sob. The knowledge that their breakthrough is responsible for the terror gripping the city is an unbearable burden. MARIA (overwhelmed) Our children… are they… DR. STEVENS (interrupting, grim) I’ve been trying to reach the schools all morning. Communications are down city-wide. We don’t know who’s… who’s still alive. Ed slams a fist on the console in frustration, his rage a silent scream challenging the chaos. Maria turns to him, eyes pooling with tears—desperation etched on her face. MARIA (pleading) We have to do something, Ed! ED (resolute) And we will. We fix this. We find the cure and distribute it. No rest until this damn virus is eradicated from every last soul it’s touched. They stand united, a feeble bulwark against an abyss that threatens to consume the world they know. CUT TO: EXT. CITY - WIDE SHOT - DAY The camera pans over the once-bustling metropolis, now a ghost town.

Around the corner lumbers a group of zombies, their movements jerky and erratic. The sight is jarring, the realization of their nightmare fully manifest. MARIA (in a hushed tone) Ed… Without hesitation, ED takes the lead, signaling MARIA to stay behind him. Despite his scientific mind rebelling against the logic of their existence, his survival instincts kick in. They back away slowly, but the zombies advance with increasing hunger. The corridor’s confines amplify their mangled cries. Ed and Maria turn to run, but the creatures are relentless in pursuit. One of the zombies lunges forward, catching ED by the arm. Its teeth sink into his flesh—a searing pain that echoes with the unbearable finality of his fate. MARIA (screaming) Ed! She pulls Ed away with a strength born of desperation, dragging him toward a nearby reinforced door. They stumble through just in time, slamming it shut on their assailants. INT. GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE ROOM - CONTINUOUS The couple slumps against the door, breathing heavily. Ed grunts as he clutches the wound, blood oozing between his fingers—a cruel testament to their perilous situation. MARIA (tearfully) It’s not deep, we can treat it. ED (panting, pain-ridden) Maria… I don’t have much time… MARIA (shaking her head) Don’t say that. We’ll find the antidote. We’ll… Ed gives a pained smile, his eyes reflecting both love and sorrow. ED (urgently) Listen to me. You need to continue without me. Find the cure, Maria. MARIA collapses beside him, the horror of the moment washing over her. The reality they tried to escape has consumed them, as the weight of their predicament settles like a shroud. FADE OUT. END OF PAGE 28 OF 150 This emotional scene vividly depicts the first direct confrontation with zombies for Ed and Maria.

GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE RESEARCH FACILITY - DAY The room buzzes with the subdued whirr of high-tech machinery. MARIA scrambles, her hands fumbling through vials and medical supplies, searching for anything that might save ED. He lies on a cot, his complexion growing paler, his breaths shallow. MARIA’s hands shake as she uncaps a vial labeled “Prototype Antidote 7A.” Desperation fills her eyes as she fills a syringe and turns to ED with steely determination. MARIA (breathlessly) Ed, this is experimental, but it’s based on our earlier research. It could save you. ED (weakly, but with a firm resolve) Do it… anything for a chance. Maria injects the contents into his arm. They wait, the seconds stretching into an eternity. Suddenly, Ed convulses, a guttural groan escaping his lips as his body reacts to the drug. MARIA (frantic) Hold on, Ed! Hold on! His convulsions slow, then stop. Slowly, his breathing steadies, and the color begins to return to his cheeks. Maria sighs with relief as she watches him, her own body sagging with exhaustion. ED (voice stronger) Maria… it’s working. I can feel it fighting the virus. MARIA collapses beside him, tears of relief streaming down her face. They embrace, a moment of hope amidst the terror that surrounds them. Suddenly, the door bursts open, ZOMBIES spill into the room, their groans filling the air with dread. With a surge of adrenaline, MARIA springs to her feet, seizing a nearby fire extinguisher. She sprays the advancing horde, her other hand grabbing Ed, pulling him towards an emergency exit. ED (urgently) Go, Maria! Get out of here! MARIA shakes her head, determination blazing in her eyes. MARIA (screaming) Not without you, Ed! Just as they reach the door, a ZOMBIE lunges, its teeth bared for Maria’s neck. In a split-second decision, Ed shoves her through the door, slamming it behind her, locking himself inside with the undead. MARIA (desperately pounding the door) ED! No! But Ed’s fate is sealed. As Maria sobs, slumped against the door, the sounds of the scuffle inside fade. A profound silence settles, and a new resolve takes hold. MARIA (vow in her voice) I’ll make it right, Ed. I’ll save them all. CUT TO: EXT. GENEsis LABORATORY - ROOFTOP HELIPAD - CONTINUOUS A helicopter approaches, the wind from its blades scattering papers and debris across the rooftop.

GENEsis LABORATORY - SECURE RESEARCH FACILITY - DAY The sterile corridor is now a cacophony of terror. MARIA bears witness to ED’S transformation—skin deathly pale, veins blackening. With the shadow of zombification drawing near, he makes a drastic choice. ED (determined, to Maria) Go! Save our children… save everyone. With a mix of horror and fierce resolve, ED flings himself through the window, landing on the concrete below with an unnatural ferocity only the infected possess. Maria watches as Ed, now imbued with the strength and resilience of the undead but mercifully retaining his mind, staggers to his feet and storms into the city. CUT TO: EXT. CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS With the mind of a scientist but the body of a monster, ED trudges through the chaotic streets, an insatiable need to protect and a relentless drive to find their children fuelling his every step. MARIA, atop the helipad, is torn between following ED and escaping with the cure. Tears stream down her face as she calls out to him, though he can no longer hear her. MARIA (screaming into the void) I love you… I’ll find them, I promise! With the cries of her husband echoing in her ears, Maria vows to carry on their fight and save the city they love. She watches Ed disappear into the horde of zombies, a lone figure of tragedy amidst the devastation. The helicopter, hovering anxiously, becomes her only refuge.

Her hands never waver, her eyes never stray. The readouts wink back at her with promising data, and the compound finally takes form—a vial shining with the hope of humanity. MARIA (declaration of war on the apocalypse) This is only the beginning. Run zombie, run. END OF PAGE 30 OF 150 PAGE 31 OF 150 EXT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - MORNING ED KAYNES, his body a mismatch of human fear and zombified resilience, slips through the shattered gates of what was once a sanctuary of learning. A tattered scarf partially conceals his grotesque features, signs of his incomplete transformation into the undead. Silently, he navigates the overgrown courtyard, each step deliberate to avoid drawing attention. Windows, dark and soulless, gape open like the eyes of the dead—witnesses to the devastation within. CUT TO: INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS Ed’s entry is a mirror to his internal chaos—a man, formerly a herald of progress, now reduced to a creature of instinct and desperation. His gait, once confident, is now a sober march into the unknown. He tiptoes past classrooms where silent echoes of children’s laughter are replaced by the somber reality of abandonment. Broken furniture and scattered papers litter the floor—a flashback to the day when life unraveled. A weak groan echoes down the hall as Ed pauses, a sideways glance revealing a lone zombie staggering between the desks of what used to be a third-grade classroom. Ed suppresses a shudder, steeling himself against the macabre scenery. He scans the empty, desolate rooms, searching for any sign of his children—backpacks, a stray drawing, a forgotten toy—anything that would offer a shred of hope. But the silence is the only answer. CUT TO: INT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS Ed arrives at the gym, a cavernous hollow now home to dust and despair. Sunlight streams through broken skylights, carving shadows that pool like blood on the hardwood floor. He scans the rafters, a haunting tableau of memories and lost days playing out in the sunbeams. As real as the danger is, it’s the threat of finding irrevocable truth that tightens his chest—a father’s fear, potent even in undeath. But there’s no trace, no joyous clamor of children, no after-school exclamations. They’re gone, swept away by the cataclysm that swept through their lives like a malevolent tide. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS Ed emerges from the school, the line between man and zombie blurred by his faltering, heart-wrenching mission. Desolation repels hope like opposite poles of a tragic magnet. Torn by failure, Ed turns away from the forlorn landmark of his children’s laughter, now a crypt to his unspoken fear. His eyes, rimmed with the red of grief and infection, look beyond—towards the distant, fortified silhouette of his bunker. MONTAGE – ED’S JOURNEY TO THE BUNKER: - Ed’s shadow stretches along the cracked pavement as he trudges through the eerie streets, a spectral figure moving against the grain of desolation. - At intersections, he ducks into the shadows, avoiding the roving packs of zombies that cluster around the remnants of life—imperfect kin he no longer resembles. - The bunker’s hidden entrance, a sliver between the ruins, beckons—a sanctuary amid a city usurped by death. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS A blast door seals with an echo, enveloping Ed in the silence of his clandestine refuge. He peels away the scarf, revealing the visage of a man ensnared between two realities. Amid the quiet hum of survival equipment, Ed perches on the edge of a cot, hands clasped, elbows resting on his knees. He is the epitome of the isolated soul—lost in the chasm between the living and the not. Remnants of humanity nest in the bunker—photographs, clothes, a child’s crayon drawing affixed to a wall. Through the stillness, Ed’s rasping breath is a dissonant chorus, filling the void with his internal war. ED (muttering to himself) I’ll find them—alive or… I must. He rises, a gaunt figure against the backdrop of monitors flickering with disconnected surveillance feeds. With grim acceptance, he begins to arm himself for the world above, the haven below now a grave to his former self. END OF PAGE 31 OF 150 PAGE 32 OF 15 INT. ED’S BUNKER - WASHROOM - CONTINUOUS Ed stands, a tragic figure, before the worn mirror; his flesh sags and his eyes are pools of dread. Clusters of hair slip through his trembling fingers, each strand a part of his old self, relinquishing to the monster he is becoming. A gasp of despair chokes out as he beholds the naked scalp in the mirror, a stark declaration of his metamorphosis. Tears well up, spilling over, tracing grimy paths down his deformed cheeks. The bunker trembles, a distant cataclysm making the very earth weep. A shelf rattles and the few personal effects he’s salvaged from his previous life threaten to tumble and shatter. ED (Screaming, his voice a ragged echo of rage and fear) NOOOOO! NO!..NO! Overcome with grief, he slams a fist against the mirror, the crack spider-webbing across his fractured reflection. His knees buckle, and he sinks to the ground amidst the fallen hair—an island of agony in a sea of cold tile. His wails fill the cramped space, a chilling symphony to a soul in mourning. And in this moment of anguish, the bunker shakes—dust falling like ancient witnesses to his pain. Shelves rattle, threatening to topple, the explosion’s distant thunder a cruel reminder of the world falling apart above. Ed’s cries meld with the deep, seismic vibrations from outside, both the internal and external worlds crumbling in unison. In this fortress of solitude, his tether to sanity and solidarity grows dangerously thin. CUT TO: EXT.

CITY COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS OPERATORS switch between feeds, each scene more chaotic than the last—a city under the shadow of catastrophic failure. The COMMANDER grabs the microphone, urgency tensing his voice. COMMANDER (into microphone) All units, brace for potential aftershocks. We have confirmation of detonation. This is not a drill. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS ED reels from the shockwave, his once stoic facade crumbling. The instruments and gauges surrounding him now mere spectators to his unraveling. ED (hoarse shout) What have we done?! He wrenches away from the mirror, stumbling as the ground continues to betray him. A shelf crashes down, its contents—a journal, a photo, remnants of the past—spill across the floor, a poignant reminder of life before the fall. CUT TO: EXT. CITY STREET - CONTINUOUS The aftermath of the explosion erupts into a chaotic torrent of action—civilian and military alike now share only the common goal of survival. AND CUT BACK TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS ED lunges for a two-way radio, the last line connecting him to the world he fought to save—a world that might no longer exist. His hand caresses the tuning knob, static filling the clean space of the bunker. His voice, modulated by desperation and the unearthly timbre of his new form, crackles into the void. ED (into the radio, desperate) Is anyone out there…? Children… Please… As the static answers back, heavy and relentless, the camera captures a final shot of ED—an echo of humanity caught in the purgatory between life and death. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 32 OF 150 PAGE 33 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The siren’s wail pierces the bunker’s thick silence, a banshee scream announcing impending doom.

BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS ED stands frozen, the epitome of desperation, as the last fragments of his world descend into chaos. He watches, powerless, as the skeletal outlines of his former life flicker on the screens. NEWS ANCHOR (ON MONITOR) (tense, authoritative) This is not a drill. Seek immediate shelter. A nuclear strike has been authorized and will commence within the hour. May God have mercy on us all. Ed’s eyes widen with horror at the anchor’s solemn decree. His fist clenches, shattering the radio’s silence. ED (into the radio, voice quivering) Not like this… Please, no… CUT TO: INT. SHELTER - DAY Families huddled together, their eyes glued to portable televisions broadcasting the final countdown. Tears mix with prayers, as they embrace for what could be the last time. CUT TO: INT. MILITARY WAR ROOM - DAY Amidst a flurry of activity, GENERALS and OFFICERS coordinate efforts to mitigate the disaster.

Every clank and hiss a harrowing step towards the inevitable. The camera follows his frantic actions, an intimate dance between man and machine, before pausing on his face—a visage caught between primal survival and heart-wrenching grief. ED (whispering to himself) Survive. Survive for what’s left… The bunker’s artificial lights flicker under the strain of the external world crumbling. Ed, a sentinel at the end of days, stares down the immensity of his solitude, the gravity of the moment heavy upon him. His raspy breath is the metronome to the ticking countdown, as the monitors’ once steadfast streams stutter—a digital heart rate faltering as the world prepares for its last beat. END OF PAGE 33 OF 150 PAGE 34 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The stubborn hum of outdated technology fills the air as ED hunches over the mainframe terminal of the bunker, his fingers a flurry over the backlit keys. The screen before him flashes with layers of security access prompts and firewalls, a digital labyrinth of his own design. Ed’s mind, a cocktail of desperation and scientific prowess, races to unlock the secrets he once safeguarded so fervently. With each override command, he peels back the digital veils shrouding his research, his city’s downfall, the truth. With a final keystroke, he breaches the mainframe security. The floodgates open, and data streams onto the monitor—classified communications, military intel, the command chain’s last orders, the enormity of the impending strike. ED (voice barely a whisper, laced with dread) Oh, what have we done… The screen maps out the grim reality—a schematized web showing the approaching missile’s trajectory, projected fallout patterns, and the bleakest scenarios outlined in stark numeric certainty. CUT TO: INT. MILITARY COMMAND BUNKER - DAY Generals hunch over radar screens, the forewarned cataclysm reflected in their stoic faces. Behind them, a wall-sized world map blinks with the Morse code of impending doom. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed’s horrified gaze traverses the information on-screen. His infected constitution wrestles with the gravity of what’s coming—ignited not by a zombie’s viral urges but by a man’s conscience and heart. ED (grappling with the scope of the cataclysm) There’s gotta be… there must be something else we can do… Anyone… He scans the screens for any sign of hope, a ceasefire, an alternative to the end. But the truth is unyielding, encoded in the logic of machines and strategic calculations. CUT TO: EXT. OBSERVATION POST - DAY A lone soldier stands sentinel, binoculars to his eyes, the distant whistle of the incoming missile harmonizing with the wail of the air raid sirens—a requiem for the world he knew. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed slams his palm against the terminal, the pain insignificant against his racing thoughts. Bitter laughter, a guttural sound devoid of humor, escapes him as he contemplates the irony—the mad scientist, the living dead, now the audience to Armageddon. ED (to himself, the laugh collapsing into a growl) We played with life and death… and now we pay the price. He rises, each movement a struggle as he opens a secure drawer, retrieving a dusty bottle of whiskey, a relic from a past life. He unscrews the cap and takes a swig, the burn a fleeting reminder of human sensations. Ed’s bloodshot eyes, tinged with yellow, fix on the countdown—a digital grim reaper ticking away the seconds of existence. FADE OUT: END OF PAGE 34 OF 150 PAGE 35 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker, once a bastion of safety, becomes a tomb as the hollow echoes of explosions reverberate through its concrete walls. ED stands still, the ghastly light of the monitors painting his face as each distant blast grows closer, louder, a chorus of annihilation gaining fervor. He grips the edge of a console, knuckles white, each rumble a hammer strike against the shield of isolation he’s erected around himself. The shockwaves travel through the floor, a tremor through the heart of the earth. CUT TO: EXT. OUTER LAYERS OF THE CITY - CONTINUOUS Overhead shots reveal fiery blooms littering the landscape, each a bitter bloom of conflict. Plumes of smoke claw at the sky, trying to blanket the sun with their unforgiving shadows. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Panic fractures Ed’s stoicism as the bunker’s survival systems activate in response to the escalating threat. Crimson alarms flare, casting a sinister glow. The ventilation system churns violently, fighting against the onslaught of the inferno waiting outside. Each detonation outside is a gut punch to the facility, the sound magnified by the silence it disrupts. Flickering screens cast erratic shadows across the walls, creating an ominous dance of light that foreshadows the end. ED (voice choked with dread) This is how it ends… Not with a whimper, but with a bang. CUT TO: INT. FAMILY SHELTER - CONTINUOUS A FAMILY huddles together, their embrace a fortress within the shuddering bunker. Children clutch their parents, eyes wide and uncomprehending, as the reverberations of the unthinkable shake their sanctuary. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - CONTINUOUS Ed slumps into his seat, resigned, the bottle slipping from his grip and rolling across the floor. The world outside may be ending, but his torment continues unabated—a curse of the undead. A single tear—unclear if it’s from sorrow or the zombie affliction—trails down his face. He watches the countdown dwindle; humanity’s tenure ticking away before his crypt-colored eyes. FADE OUT: END OF PAGE 35 OF 150 PAGE 36 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker convulses as if gripped by an unseen giant, the roar of the impact wave a deafening crescendo punctuating the still air. ED is launched from his chair, thrown to the unforgiving floor as the earth itself seems to spiral into chaos. Around him, the walls tremble, panels and ceiling tiles clattering down in a discordant symphony of destruction. The monitors blink erratically, skewing the horrific show they present—something between reality and electronic hallucination. CUT TO: EXT. CITYSCAPE - SAME MOMENT From afar, a nightmarish scene unfolds as the impact wave rips through city blocks, turning structures into dust and dreams into nightmares. The force is indiscriminate—it tears through steel like paper, glass like vapor. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed clutches at debris, dragging his altered body across the trembling floor, desperately attempting to anchor himself in a world that refuses stillness. His roars match the sound of tearing metal and shattering concrete—primal, raw, filled with terror. CUT TO: SERIES OF SHOTS - BUNKER’S DISTRESS: A. The once orderly rows of canned goods and emergency provisions cascade onto the now-tilting floors. B. Water pipes burst, geysers erupting in formerly dry rooms, while electrical sparks create a dangerous light show. C. A portrait of Ed’s family, clinging to the wall, now slips free and crashes to the ground, the glass protecting their smiles shattering. BACK TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed, crawling through the mayhem, reaches for the bunker’s emergency protocols—a last-ditch hope to seal away the cataclysm that hunts for him within his sanctuary. Lights flicker overhead, many winking out, as the integrity of their fixtures fail. He hits the master lockdown button, and with a metallic groan, reinforced doors slide shut, drowning the chaos into muffled fury. The sanctuary becomes sarcophagus. Over the din of destruction, Ed’s distorted cry resonates—half man, half beast, all despair. ED (screaming above the noise) Survive! I must… survive… The camera pulls out from the scene, leaving Ed a solitary, writhing figure amidst the anarchy that ensnares him—an amalgam of man’s hubris and the savage grip of nature’s retribution, locked in a bunker, locked in turmoil. FADE OUT: END OF PAGE 36 OF 150 PAGE 37 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Amidst the chaos and the runaway dance of shadows and light, ED struggles against the unforgiving floor that refuses to stay still beneath him. His limbs, misshapen by his condition and shaken by the concussive forces, push against the tiles with a strength born from the darkest depths of survival instinct. Grit and dust cake his flesh as he labors for breath, a horrifying rasp that competes with the bunker’s groans and the distant, thunderous booms that refuse to fade away. Pain lances through him; whether from the fall, the shockwaves, or his own internal transformation, it’s impossible to tell. But it fuels him, drives him—the agony a reminder of life amidst a landscape that speaks only of annihilation. CUT TO: EXT. CITY RUINS - SAME MOMENT A cloud of dust and debris blankets the horizon where the city once teemed with life. The singular fury of the initial blast has given birth to countless offspring—sporadic eruptions that devour the remnants of a world now confined to memory and echoes. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Ed gasps, his body hauled up to an unsteady crouch, fingertips white-knuckled as they grip a shattered piece of the console for support. Desperation swims in his eyes—a cocktail of torment, the will to endure, the knowledge that to succumb now is to surrender to the void. He scans the room through the haze, sees the sealed blast doors, the blinking red of systems barely clinging to function. In this stolen pause, where death seems to have drawn in a breath, Ed finds a semblance of order amidst the tumult. ED (voice a raspy whisper tinged with determination) Not yet… Not today… Tremors wrack his form, but they cannot break the spirit that fuels his battered frame. This bunker, this grave, this womb—it will not be his terminus. With a shake of his head, Ed stands fully, a testament to defiance. His cries subside to murmurs, to mantras of survival that carry him forward—a symphony played against the thunderous backdrop of the world’s end. FADE TO BLACK: END OF PAGE 37 OF 150 PAGE 38 OF 150 INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS The bunker’s foundation rattles under the relentless assault, dust cascading like tiny waterfalls from the ceiling. ED, half-zombie, stands amidst a glistening coat of sweat and grime, swaying unevenly as the earth beneath him convulses. He fixates on the emergency lighting, its flickering a spasmodic dirge to the rhythm of apocalypse, his mind racing with primal urgency. Every painful breath is a struggle, drowning in a sea of helplessness and confusion. His flesh, marked both by the zest of the undead and the scars of scientific torment, stretches over his hands as if trying to flee from the bone. His ashen lips mutter a garbled prayer to loved ones lost to either fate or the flame. Ed staggers forward, a mote of dust in the grim tableau of his sanctuary. He salvages a heavy crowbar from the scattered arsenal of survival tools. Its heft gives him a grotesque sense of purpose—a weapon against the barriers that cage him. Footsteps echo with thunderous intent, resonating upon the metal floor, as he assumes the stance of one prepared to battle titans. With a grunt, he wedges the crowbar into the seams of a heavy looking hatch, muscles and sinews bulging in grotesque relief against his lab coat. The strain reddens his eyes, fueling veins with an unnerving fervor. Gritted teeth are bared, the intonation of pained struggle filling the space, as he channels every ounce of his monstrous strength into the task. The metal groans, protesting, as if the very bunker itself is aware of Ed’s unwinnable war against time. With each incremental victory of leverage, the raw scrape of crowbar against hatch is a requiem for reason, a siren call of the myriad dead and dying above. ED (straining, a whisper to himself) Survive, protect, endure… No matter the cost. A sudden lurch, and the hatch gives way, surrendering to Ed’s determination with a scream of yielding steel. A dim shaft of light, alien in the confines of the bunker, pierces the grimy air—a fragile thread leading back to the chaos of a once familiar world. Ed, panting, a line of blood trickling from where the crowbar had slipped, rights himself—a ghastly architect of his own salvation or doom, straddling two realms he never wished to know. The bunker stands defiant, its heart now exposed. And as the camera zooms out, Ed, the anomaly, reaches toward the beckoning light—a specter grappling with the very essence of existence and annihilation. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 38 OF 150 PAGE 39 OF 150 EXT. CITYSCAPE - DAY From the depths of the bunker, ED emerges into a world transformed beyond recognition. A vast wasteland of destruction stretches before him, the cityscape now a twisted shadow of its former self. The ground, littered with debris and the remnants of buildings, challenges every step. Yet Ed advances, his silhouette a stark contrast against the backdrop of a demolished city. CUT TO: INT. ED’S BUNKER - COMMAND CENTER - CONTINUOUS Back inside the shaking bunker, Ed’s hands move with purpose, fueled by an unyielding instinct for survival and protection. He scans the room, now a collapsed chamber of his former life, searching for anything that will aid his escape. He spots his toolbox, hurled by the tremors to a corner. Within lies a collection of tools, each associated with a memory of maintenance and preparedness, each now essential for a far grimmer purpose. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED STREET - CONTINUOUS Ed navigates the treacherous terrain. He grips a robust pipe wrench, repurposed now as a cudgel to fend off the encroaching undead and clear his path of obstacles. His movements are mechanical, devoid of the finesse of the living but driven by a persistent will that seems almost alien in these ruins. Each swing of the wrench is a statement of defiance, a claim to life in a realm of death. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSED BUILDING - CONTINUOUS Ed approaches a mound of rubble where a building once stood. Determination etches his features as he sets about methodically removing pieces of concrete and twisted metal. With each thrust and pry of his makeshift tools, he paves a way through the destruction. His movements are heavy but precise, the products of a mind that refuses to surrender to defeat. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED OVERPASS - CONTINUOUS Ahead lies the skeletal remains of what was once a vital overpass, its concrete bones a grim parody of the city’s past prosperity. Ed braces himself and climbs, his upheaved hands finding cracks and purchase among the debris. His progress is slow and arduous, but the sight of the overpass’s peak, a symbol of hope, spurs him onward. CUT TO: EXT. CITYSCAPE - HIGH ANGLE - CONTINUOUS Ed reaches the summit of the overpass and pauses, his gaze sweeping over the horizon. The wreckage stretches as far as the eye can see, but this height gives perspective—there is a path to be forged, a direction to take. He takes a deep breath, the air a mingled scent of dust and destruction, and raises his wrench high. It’s a gesture of both challenge and resolve, a signal that his journey through this nightmare has only just begun. FADE TO BLACK. END OF PAGE 39 OF 150 PAGE 40 OF 150 EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - DAY ED’s lone figure is dwarfed by the gaping wound of the city. His every step is a testament to his unshakable resolve. The wrench, now an extension of his will, pierces the rubble blocking his path. CUT TO: EXT. COLLAPSED SUBWAY ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS Ed approaches the maw of a collapsed subway entrance. Sunlight pierces through the cracks, casting slivers of light that dance on the mangled steel and broken tiles. With each piece of debris he removes, the way forward becomes clearer. He works in silence, his breaths and the sound of falling concrete the only interruptions in the deathly quiet. CUT TO: INT. SUBWAY TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS The darkness of the tunnel envelops Ed as he descends. The beam from his makeshift torch, fashioned from a rag and salvaged alcohol, flickers against the walls, throwing exaggerated shadows around him. He navigates the shattered remains of the underground with a mixture of zombie-like indifference and human caution, the two natures merged into one being, surviving by instinct and intellect. CUT TO: EXT. ABANDONED HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS Ed emerges onto the cracked surface of a highway, once a vein pulsing with life, now a silent artery in a dead metropolis. He takes a moment to scan the expanse for movement, for any sign of those like him or worse. Empty cars stand as monuments to a sudden catastrophe, their doors agape, their stories untold. CUT TO: INT. CRUSHED CAR - CONTINUOUS Ed peers through the window of a half-collapsed vehicle. Inside, a skeleton grips the steering wheel, a stark reminder of society’s abrupt end. For a moment, Ed sees himself—not so different from the bones. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - OVERLOOK - CONTINUOUS Climbing atop a pile of rubble that offers a vantage point, Ed scans the horizon. His heart, whatever is left of it, aches. The city lies in ruins, but amidst the desolation, there is a faint echo of hope—a whisper of life. CUT TO: EXT. NARROW CREVICE BETWEEN BUILDINGS - CONTINUOUS Ed finds a narrow passageway, wedged between two faltering skyscrapers. The space is tight, claustrophobic, but the fresh air beckoning from the other side is unmistakable—a breath of the world beyond. He squeezes through the gap, the walls scraping against his flesh, now so foreign to pain. As he emerges, the air hits him like a wave of the past. It’s tinged with the acrid scent of smoke and decay, yet underneath it all is the undeniable smell of survival. CUT TO: EXT. RUINED CITYSCAPE - CONTINUOUS Ed stands at the threshold of the crevice, the firmament open before him. He takes a long, deep breath, feeling the air churn within his lungs—half-life, half-death. A resolve settles deep within his marrow. He steps forward, leaving the shadows behind. Ahead, the path is fraught with ruin and remembrance, but it is his to tread. With the wrench slung over his shoulder, Ed sets out into the sunlit devastation, a figure of determination silhouetted against the crumbling silhouette of a fallen world. FADE OUT.

I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance\\" (Luke v.31, 32). Christ is the Great Physician. And you only need to put your life in his hands. You just agree to lay on the table and let him work on you. It is about Trust,....FAITH.

James 1:27 \\"Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this, To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to keep himself unspotted from the world.\\" The Old Testament is about God's Promise to the world via Abraham's descendants both spiritual and bloodline, the New Testament concerns the immediate and future fulfilment of said Promise through the Messiah whose deity in human form fulfils the 'wages of sin' requirement for all humanity (a price no man can pay, being the debtor in sin, Jesus Christ being sinless/creditor). The Promise is the ending of the mortal and spiritual death cycle triggered at Eden at the Fall of Man, to become Born Again right now and therefore re-united in a personal-experience-spiritual-connection-relationship to the Creator, God, and Father, Yahoveh via (Yeshua) Jesus Christ His son through whom we are Born Again by confession/renouncing of our personal sins and acceptance of His sacrifice to deliver us from permanent and spiritual death, while still alive.. The Resurrection being the bodily proof for the first Apostles that mortal death cannot hold those who are \\"slain\\" with Jesus on the cross--symbolised in water baptism since no-one is required to die Christ's 'once for all' death... which is why the believers promise of bodily resurrection at the Last Trumpet sound is an End Times Biblical imperative for soul winning: it's the teaching that if you both confess God's Son and live like He does in fact exist in your worldview, then you will be counted by Christ on Judgment Day when He closes our current age and begins the Kingdom Age, you will be raised to life exactly as Jesus Christ was who then went on to be witnessed by hundreds of eye witnesses et al as we read in the New Testament post-resurrection accounts). (I'm well aware of the symbolism that gnostics and Truthers connotate regarding baptism and the numerology, thanks.) 'Born Again' is not to be confused with reincarnation. Rebirth â‰ Born Again. Born Again means existential character change and amendment to your values through your human spirit into who you are in living: a changed. better you; less sinful and more holy minded. This is not merely \\"change your mind\\", it's that, and a spiritual transformation through the healing influence of God's Holy Spirit-- the Creator reworks you away from sin, and you choose by desire to keep that path. \\"spirit wars with flesh; flesh wars with spirit\\" Born Again is the pathway towards bodily resurrection into the immortal, perfect body -the one required to exist in the Heavenly realms, of water and spirit; our current bodies are water and dust. The body remains and is updated away from the sinful flesh body into a body akin to the power of the Messengers (Angels), the soul keeps the body. Not re-incarnation, you don't incarnate twice! A body that cannot know sickness or death- pure divine power. Re-incarnation (as I understand it) requires permanent physical death of the old body where the next person you think you see is not a unique \\"own\\" person, but a recycled soul into a new body (or so the recycled pagan myth (ancient Egyptians and modern Easterners sound the same here) appears to describe itself). So \\"religion\\" as the world defines it doesn't count here, as the Gospel defines it directly in the context of a Christian's existence. If we are critiquing Bible, we are reading the impartations of Yahoveh (translation of not, it is still God's authorship penned by His Prophets and Apostles).Therefore, God defines it all, the content therein, because His message is self-sufficient to Save, teach, rebuke, correct, and build up anyone who reads it who chooses to accept the message.

God doesnâ€™t define killing an animal as murder, so when assuming to speak of what God says, why did you tell God He was wrong by that comment, isnâ€™t that unstudied arrogance? (And a second round of unback claims on your part?) Two different words in Hebrew, one for kill, the other for murder, guess which is used in the Sixth Commandment? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RENPaY043o Basics Murder is illegal and immoral, unprovoked attack against another human being. This has specific moral connotations that do not extend to animals. Man is superior to the being of an animal and is expected to treated them well. Man is also permitted to eat animals: Genesis 9, Jesus ate fish (tail end of Johnâ€™s Gospel), Romans 14 renders that meat eaters and non-meat eaters are to respect each other without interference, and that if the act is too much then for meat eaters to abstain in their presence. 1 Timothy 4 cites that itâ€™s a demonic doctrine that forces/commands others, from humans, to force and order human beings to not ever eat meat. No, angels are not to breed with humans. If they were, then like human relations, there would be laws to govern how they do. Only humans get sexual activity laws pronounced to protect their spirit from sexual immorality from unfettered, immoral carnal activity. But angels did anyway? How so. Was God powerless to stop it? No. Freewill. Angels have choice. Flaming Cherubim Halel the Lucifer chose to act in sedition. Lucifer got cast out of Heaven after losing a war in Heaven with Michael. God imparts freewill to all sentient creatures, and punishes immediately, curses/sets a determined future punishment, for the wicked actions our freedom of will gets wasted upon. If youâ€™ve read Enoch, then youâ€™d know Genesis 6 is elaborated on, giving a tour of the background detail. God does not sanction sexual intercourse between humans and non-human entities, including earth originated creatures that are not human. Youâ€™ve tripped over thinking the REBELLION of Watchers to breed with women, is God giving permission. You are wrong to think that. Namely, itâ€™s â€œrebellionâ€ that should tell you anything. Angels have freedom of will, same as humans. Comes with being creations of God who created as an act of His divine will and purpose. Genesis 6 and Enoch both detail that those Watcher class angels whoâ€¦ watch the earth and report to Godâ€¦ a set number of them lusted after human women, and made pact to descend to earth and damn themselves, to bear children. It would appear that angels can feel the same as humankind. Jesus is not a copy of pagan gods. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30AunYXtYDg To conflate your own error with somehow the Vatican inventing rubbish regarding the Jewish-borne faith in Messiah that they hijacked and perverted into a fake-Christianity rooted in Babylonian paganism and Satanic occultismâ€¦. Is an odd position, but coming from you (at this point)â€¦.. (you would believe that, wouldnâ€™t you.) No, Christians, and Jesus, are not copies of pagan gods. Thatâ€™s a monumentally intellectually dishonest assertion. Unless you can deliver knowledge and evidence that the Egyptian perception and the Jewish perception of â€œgodsâ€ , the natural world and spiritual places was 100% equal, you have nothing. No former or future religion has ever founded by a culture that was genuinely originally monotheist and aimed at worshipping a singular, Supreme, all-powerful, uncreated, eternal, self-existent being composed and existing in Spirit and embodying the very essence and meaning of Light and Truth. All other religions were either humanistic, pantheist, occult/pagan, witchcraft orientated, or nature worshipping in the form of Demi-gods/human worship. Egypt was a pantheon of pantheist deities, some greater some lesser, but all figuratively divine, and never once met by a former generation of Egyptiansâ€¦ just believed in according to the inventions of their magician priest class. The Egyptians drew stories of their philosophies, but never did their history include someone in their historical memories who ever literally met/experienced their alleged gods (unless I am sorely mistaken). Judeo-Christian is observably, and functionally the opposite in nature. In fact, the whole of Judea-Christian literature shows us that Jewish belief, law, tradition, and the arrival at the earthly side of Godâ€™s promises in the apostles following Jesus Christ, are all based on an experience with the only True and living God all within a generational memory and linguistic history. Egypt canâ€™t even come close to this, or any other culture for that matterâ€¦.. with loose exception made for pre-Flood cultures and existent cultures and religions that worshipped Annunaki (fallen, rebel angels) et al similar examples. Taking note: the culture and religion that survived into long term stay whilst other religions and their â€œmighty godsâ€ were lost to timeâ€¦. Yet no atheist asks why and what makes the survivors so special. It couldnâ€™t possibly be that they were right, could it? (I am being sarcastic in asserting the fact of the Judeo-Christian Godâ€™s observable supremacy and staying power through time as a single-handed meta-physical example of proof of correctness and existential validity: time destroys lies). No other deity was experienced as God/Jesus was, so no other god can be called anything other than idol, deified natural world element, or glorified god-invented-in-the-image-of-man rather than man-made-in-Gods-image idea. * @tjguy7169: @@truthliberty5695 I didn't say anything about the nephilim from Enoch I said God would not give permission for gabriel to impregnate Mary and that is what happened literally says came in unto her he came in her.

No, I told you about Nephilim and Enoch because it directly related to the error you gave me. I gave you CLEAR textual evidence, WITH link, that tells YOU that Gabriel shows up on location, not â€œentered in â€œuntoâ€ Mary in a sexual actâ€ which is NOT what happened. The Holy Spirit OVERSHADOWS Mary, which is the rest of the verse across the Gospels, which is the origin of how Messiah is conceived of the Holy Spirit without the use of sin â€” fallen man entering into a virgin sanctuary.

Youâ€™re criminalising a guy for the way latter personâ€™s depicted him according to THEIR traditions and beliefs? You flunked your own test. Jesus is the image of God, and as God Himself â€” bearing His Fatherâ€™s name/image: when a King sends an emissary/ambassador then that person sent carries the presence and authority of that King who sent themâ€¦. This isnâ€™t difficult or a problem, itâ€™s a Biblical fact. Yes, you can worship Jesus/God. By being in equality with God by merit of being OF God in equal SPIRIT, TRUTH and SUBSTANCEâ€¦. God hasnâ€™t shared power with anyone â€œelseâ€ , itâ€™s remained with God. Father and Son carry the title of God. Youâ€™re right and agreeing with the Bible when you affirm that: God doesnâ€™t change: His SPIRIT, TRUTH and SUBSTANCE remain ever the same, as does His expectations, commandments and Lawâ€¦. Youâ€™re the one who canâ€™t seem to keep up with Godâ€¦ also, mixing facts with pagan anti-Christian hearsay, is blinding you and making you come up with silly contradictions in pretence of me being wrong. I mixed nothing. YOU: â€œYou're one of these Christians that can't accept that maybe their religion came from ancient myths ECT.â€ You need proof that it does come from pagan sources, and youâ€™ve never proven it does. I proved everything to the contrary, youâ€™re the one being dense, not I. No, all cultures do not have the exact same story. They have similar IDEAS told in paradoxically different ways. Similar, also, does NOT mean SAME. Same = clone, with nothing changed, omitted or otherwise adapted. You have no clones in history, just anomalies of similarity only. By why not, do we not all share the same history under One True Living God, subject to the same presence of evil spirits and rebellious angels? You say â€œitâ€™s all the sameâ€ , and I say to that â€œwhat did you expect, itâ€™s the world Jesus made formerly as the Word of God, creating with God, as God, laying the foundation of the world. There are no surprises here.â€ I have no pagan â€œsunâ€ God. I do not worship the sun, a specimen of creation that is made by God. Did you not hear this in the last response?? A sun worshipper worships the creation, naming a supposed/alleged â€œgodâ€ who governs just the sun. I worship the Creator of the Heavens, the earth, and all that exists and breathes within both. You need to learn the different between allegory, parable, and literalism: when the Bible refers to Christ Jesus as the â€œsunâ€ , the language used is not calling the actual creation â€œGod Himselfâ€ , that would be stupid and inconsistent with Judeo-Christian as a whole, rather it references Christ Jesus, using a known earthy thing, as the Light of the World (again, John 1) â€” this isnâ€™t a crime, itâ€™s unbiblical, and it is not worship of the earthly sun that God created on the fourth day. Yes, the modern white Jesus is that man, Borgia, a self-deifying pagan after the Caesar line, I agree. Jesus was Jewish, not a Roman. The Vatican created that image on purpose to STEAL the identity of Jewish Jesus and make the Catholics paganise into worshipping the â€œgodâ€ of the â€œHolyâ€ Roman Empire, Caesar. As I told you well before in the other comment: The identity of Jesus was hijacked by Rome. You should read me WAY more carefully. I am writing in simpleton sentences, and yet you still read like one. On what evidence do you declare the age of Mary? (If the Bible doesnâ€™t say, you sure as heck shouldnâ€™t, unless backed with historical data) Even if Mary was, in post-modern terms, underage, do you understand the cultural differences of now versus then? By what/whose moral law is something underage in Jewish culture, and when did you get to be chief interpretation of whether it was? Donâ€™t do a Marxist revision of history and judge the ancient past according to modern cultural myths, that makes you a dishonest buttbag. Do you know that pedophilia, fundamentally at the root of its meaning and function (but not generally overall), involves children far too young for â€œhigh schoolâ€ being groomed by adults for inflicting confusing sexual acts and abuse on those minors? Culturally, a sensible, grown, \\"of age\\" Jewish girl would be married off to a young, adult male of similar age range. But you don't care about those facts, do you? Adulthood is a subjective thing per culture, but the West is indoctrinated to forget. Example: in the Solomon Islands, if a young boy can maintain a garden and make/use his own canoe: he is an adult in his culture... but you're ignorant. What do you know of anything? Iâ€™m sure you might attack that as me condoning pedophilia (I condemn pedophilia btw), but you need to understand, 1. Girls mature faster than boys. 2. People overall were more robust and more mature in the less cosy and â€œsafety hystericalâ€ world such as the B.C. era, which includes â€œchildrenâ€ in age only. 3. The modern/future does not reflect the sociology of the far past, though we repeat the same stuff by merit of the world we live in â€œnothing is new under the sunâ€ . So, what is your evidence that Mary was too young? Keeping in mind that the Talmud IS NOT an inspired work of God, but the pagan writings of the Babylonian Rabbis (it is corrupt). I mean, if you were there in the B.C. era of the Jews and thus carry and more intimate knowledge of marriage processes among the people: by all means, detail me the thing WITH LINKS TO HISTORICAL FACTS. As I would have. Mary was the focus because of her shared royal bloodline to King David, and because she was still available for marriage, being a virgin: a virgin birth is crucial for a sinless born Messiah... but that's doing your thinking and biblical history study for you, isn't it? Itâ€™s a fact. Just because YOU find it hard or lack the mental faculties for now to understand it completely, doesnâ€™t make it wrong, it makes it beyond you to yet grasp. BIIIIIIG difference. Youâ€™re right, Muslims (early ones, to be fair, but existing in modern times) ARE pedophiles by historical and literary example. When â€œ18â€ is considered old age, sheeeeesh. Nope. Ps. In case you forgot: Gabriel has no children. Get over it. The Bible doesnâ€™t prove it for you, I proved that it doesnâ€™t, and youâ€™re just a self-satisfied troll who thinks repeating it makes it true. Wrong. Repeating it makes you deaf and a complete idiot who canâ€™t read. ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ and the funniest partâ€¦ itâ€™s somehow wrong to you that Godâ€™s son, â€œimpregnated by Gabriel actually (according to you)â€ is somehow Josephs fault because you arbitrarily decided Joseph was 30 years of age. Youâ€™re right, God would not do that (â€¦not that God ever didâ€¦). Youâ€™re too funny to be taken literally or seriously anymore!

The concept of us â€œnot being able to be goodâ€ agrees with what we see everyday, itâ€™s impossible for us to be truly GOOD because we are in fact sinners, and we always will be, like a crime doer, once a thief always a thief, once a murderer always a murderer. You may have moved on and stop these crimes, but doesnâ€™t erase your past. This is why God came in the flesh to fulfill his own laws, to live out a perfect life and to die for us, every crime needs to be judged, and Jesus saved us from that judgement. Itâ€™s like in a court room, youâ€™ve got a stack of speeding tickets and you either pay up or face jail time, and someone comes in and pays your wage, you can walk away free because that man/woman took that burden upon himself for you, thatâ€™s exactly what Jesus did for us in a sense. I know Jesus exists because I have experienced him for myself. I lost my dad April 4th of last year and JESUS is the name I called on for help, for strength and guidance, and I got it. It was like no feeling Iâ€™ve ever experienced, I always thought about loosing my parents throughout my life and how I would go insane, in fact I know I would go insane because I have such a strong relationship with them, but Jesus kept me from that breaking point, I donâ€™t know what he did, but he made me stronger spiritually. Iâ€™m sorry for my rant, but itâ€™s sad to see people playing with different religions not knowing the full truth when the full truth and nothing but the truth is waiting for you right above your head, and you can learn about him through his word, the bible. * @truthliberty5695: @Gophy Go For those who know God and are filled with His Holy Spirit, as it is written, to be pure means to be unstained, to not be taking part of the evil of this world, including all unrighteousness, not breaking the Ten Commandments of God (which Jesus reiterated).

Eisegesis is imposition of meaning/reading meaning into the text, neither of which are pre-existing in the text. That is the literal definition, so you are lying. Exegesis is the opposite, it's learning cultural/era value; use of and meaning of words used in the OG text; \\"returning to the Hebrew/Greek\\" to know as exactly as possible what the author implied from the inspiration of God when they wrote it, etc.. Hermeneutics being taking the text at the literal sense of things, unless otherwise obvious that it is poetic, poetic description of the literal, prophetic language, wisdom literature etc. * @truthliberty5695: @Gophy Go Your belief is irrelevant (the Bible offers something to adopt that also changes the reader into the image of Jesus Christ in their character and person, it's not designed to be compatible with \\"the world\\" from which a Christian is called to be distinct from), as the Bible would also tell you, on which I lean. \\"Study to show yourself approved\\", \\"divide the word rightly\\", to name just two placed in the Bible. The Bible directs the reader, the inspiration for the Word KNOWS that not everyone will be bearing the Holy Spirit through whom the truth of Scripture is revealed and settled. Many \\"read\\" the Bible, some \\"get it\\" at face value, others can't or won't, or choose to dump it because it offends or contradict pre-held beliefs or notions. I can't pretend to be \\"a Christian\\" anymore than someone who rejects the Bible and its teachings could say at all, let alone convincingly (for lack of the Holy Spirit in them), that \\"Jesus Christ is Lord\\". I think that whoever you think you are from the Bible's perspective, and therefore your perception of me, is deeply skewered as it's built on a carnal pre-supposition and version of the Gospel, rather than the Gospel itself, i.e. the Bible your brain interprets for you isn't the one being interpreted from, and that's why you're mistaken: cognitive dissonance build on personal ideas on how to read the thing which are historically and textually invalid concepts that contradict the fact. * @truthliberty5695: @Gophy Go (??) â€œ*my belief*â€ doesnâ€™t exist, as Iâ€™ve stressed^, itâ€™s adoption of whatâ€™s already in there. ^ I assume you mean to tell me that [all of] what Iâ€™ve explained thus far is all my invention and absolutely, fundamentally not from the Bible nor Textually Correct study? (I disagree with you on that). A Christianâ€™s beliefs, when compared to Biblical foundation, should contain little to nothing of the individuals, carnal/pre-saved unBiblical notions. They may still understand other notions and ideas of course (Christianity is as cognitive as it is spiritual), but for the sake of Salvation, they understand the irrelevancy of beliefs and notions that do not, â€œedify and uplift the body of Christâ€ .

I certainly wouldn't recommend it. * @oisind1234: That's exactly what the enemy wants you to think. That you cannot trust anyone. In order to fully understand the gospel of Jesus Christ you must consult both your intellect and your conscience. You will not understand the truth by using your intellect alone. Jesus said he is 'the way, the truth and the life', and you can find the truth in him by asking him directly and then watching for answers. Approach your God humbly in repentance and he will respond. That's the only way you will be shown the truth. The only real question to ask yourself is - Is the truth absolute, or is it relative to any one person? Of course it is absolute. Your task is to find out the one true source of truth, and that is the gospel of Jesus Christ. If there is something you don't understand within the scriptures, ask and it will be given to you. Matthew 7:7 \\"Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. * @VanGohman: Each one of us is the sole source of truth for ourselves. If I don't know something for sure first-hand, then I don't know it at all. * @oisind1234: @@VanGohman This is why the conscience is to be consulted rather than the intellect alone. Consider this - Is a pedophile correct to consider a child a suitable mate simply because he is aroused and his intellectual mind says 'I am aroused, therefore I can proceed'. No. If he is being honest with himself, he allows his conscience to step in and say 'No, you cannot proceed, as this person is not a suitable mate.' A pedophile dependant on his intellect alone can convince himself that in 'his truth' a relationship with a child is ok. This is where God's moral law (the 10 commandments), which is written on the heart via the conscience steps in. The conscience is like a moral compass we all have that allows us to determine actual truth from lies and deception. Lies and deception creep into our lives from outside sources trying to convince us of things we, in our heart, know to be untrue. You know in your heart there is a creator, otherwise you wouldn't be here, just as when looking at a painting, you know there was a painter, regardless of having seen him in the flesh before.

Majority of the bible is meant to be taken literally, and even the parables have real life lessons we should apply to our life. Granted their is some metaphorical language, but again it is only used when describing something or to show the importance of something.

If all these people are convicted to follow this, but this pisses me off to the point I must get in their way. that is why people died for their faith. It wasn't enough to not believe for themselves, \\"screw them for desiring their beliefs.\\" That's a wholly Satanic agenda right there, and it's created converts who realise this simple truth: if it were false, dying for it would be meaningless, so whatever those killed and persecuted experienced that makes it worth it in there eyes, that factor that creates conviction is something the antagonists do not have and therefore it is something immaterial yet immutable that they can't touch let alone take away. So they respond with threats, beatings/prison, legal and social impositions and related hostilities to both the faith and its moral assertions in society (leading to further Leftist \\"tolerance\\" against Christians), banning of church/bible/believers, and killing believers. Jesus wasn't any of what you mention (in the spirit of useless that you implied it in), when you understand how Jesus Christ related to his father-- God the Father, before every task; how Jesus lived the mission he came to lead in order for his followers to have an example to live by, etc., The starting point of what you describe is found in Isaiah 52-53: The Suffering Servant, the way of purchasing humanity back to God, as all things cost, and the price of justice is death--humanity was sinful*. The Second Coming is Conquering King, descending in the same manner as he ascended. *therefore the perfect human must die for the rest to redeem those who can't save themselves according to the only real standards: Gods. Only Jesus carried that all the way to death. As the Great High Priest, going before Father God with his shed blood to offer that in exchange for what would otherwise be a hell full of humans who couldn't live up to it. That's mercy imparted by the grace of God. It's not our system, it's Gods. What you said before is a broken, humanist, egotistical \\"God must be this for me to believe it\\" bs POV. No, that's not His way of operation, and in fact that POV turns Him into an idol of what you expect and think should be. It is not the way, that's arrogant pride, beating the fist in the air to demand of God. See Job 38, because that mistake is not new. All humans are the same, waiting for their attitude to get them broken by God, or to choose humility, because the pure of heart will see God. Peace * @alzerr3574: @@truthliberty5695 me claiming that Jesus was ignorant, weak, depended and limited is a statement of ignorance? Its rather observable within Christian literature. You pin pointing the fact that people have died in the name of this faith only proves and authenticates its validity is merely nothing but the most stupidest thing you said so far. How about hitler? Was the nazi cause a valid one because so many fought for it? Appealing to the majority wonâ€™t make your beliefs right just because you want it to, its rather by evidence and reason. Stop preaching and explain how an all powerful entity who is omnipotent, omniscient, independent, unlimited can be the opposite which is weak, ignorant, depended, limited. You believe god changed his status from being all powerful to limited and ignorant? You believe god became depended on his creation while his creation is depended on him? You believe that god is ignorant and all-knowing at the same time? Beside your gospels being full of contributions, differences and added margin notes to the actual text. Dont you think if such a crucial concept of god being 3 in 1 which sums your whole doctrine should be mentioned explicitly that Jesus is god, the father is god, and the holy spirt is god? * @truthliberty5695: @@alzerr3574 More ignoranceâ€¦. My point, as stated, was to say that the premise of your description of Jesus was incorrect: rather than recognise that the appearance fulfilled pre-established spiritual objectives, you insisted on asserting a humanist fallacy: weaknesses as man defines nullifies the existence/deity of said character of Jesus. I was opposing this narrative head on. Conflating the immorality of Hitler with the moral point of Jesus Christ, by misnomer/switch of a majority argument was not wise. Itâ€™s not to do with numbers, but the reason. Dying for what you believe in is morally noble; killing others for being a specific nation or for (peaceful) belief systems is not whatâ€™s on trial here. Ok? He can be the opposite because as you said, â€œUnlimitedâ€ and â€œOmnipotentâ€ , if he canâ€™t at any point have a form that is considered weak, then how has He all this power. The humanist comprehension of power is then limited (because it can't be anything at any time, at will), if it does not lend acknowledgement that God can do itâ€¦ and how dare we assume that God should not do this if He is so inclined as is evident that He should and did. Again, why should God do as you expect, who died and made you chief director of this? Thatâ€™s so laughable. Me stop â€œpreachingâ€ ? No. Iâ€™m not telling you to stop being a fool, thatâ€™s your right as evident in your choice of direction, far be it from me to tell you to be or not be a fool: so what, or who, in true authority, gave you the right to tell me to be quiet? I will speak, same as you will. God didnâ€™t change His status. His Word aspect was sent to earth to take on human form. Notice Jesus praying to God his father, receiving power to do miracles from God his father, etc.? An aspect of God came to be among us, in human form, and still fully God, operating by the permission of Almighty Creator who resides exactly where He has always been. The body was formed, but the spirit within was pre-existent to Creation as the aspect of God that made creation. Dependance? The body was still 100% flesh, carrying the Word within it which is 100% spirit. We all depend on God for drawing our next breath, for His hand keeps these biological processes functioning. The very mystery of drawing another breath, of the hearts persistence to beat: it will, until either it can no longer, or something stops it, be that man or God. The Gospels have differences on account of different authors. Yes, through time a few dodgy translations came out. But did you know about the Hebrew Gospels stuck in a Vatican junk box, virtually untouched by the world? Thereâ€™s still more textual evidence specimens for the Bible than most of the Greek philosophical works, by thousands. Plenty to compare from to see the reflections of non-Hebrews of the Hebrew texts, and current complete texts Hebrew to Greek to English have enough agreement that they point to a since lost or destroyed text of origin that ultimately confirm a common origin. Textual witnesses to the same common truth. God is a title, not a name, denoting the highest form of being. God has an image, yet our human image is linear, bound and limited. Our image is a shade reflection of He who made our form, a being in sheer intelligence and uniquely capable of abstraction. * @alzerr3574: @@truthliberty5695 its clear that you are arrogant from the way you reply, so no need to explain your position regards your faith system.

Our belief system, we believe, is the difference because what we study of other religions shows us that things like resurrection while discussed in mythos style with exaggerated characters in other religious concepts, actually has relics left behind from where events took place. We have logic and reason to analyse how so many hundreds of people are seeing the same Messiah after rising from death, too many to be a hallucination. We have the evidence of archaeology/corroborating texts/similar cultural references outside of the Jews to affirm the origins of our faith which already had these aspects like the resurrection. We have the experiences of people whose experiences burn well past the power of skepticism to mute them outside of the hardline skeptic who is devoted to disbelief no matter what.

Yes it has most closest words and meanings. Moses wrote the first five books of the Bible which whole Bible has been edited much the newer versions leave out chapters and change words but all in all its still the word of God.

The \`Vector3.Lerp\` function linearly interpolates between two vectors based on a given interpolant value between 0 and 1. When this interpolant is a random value between 0 and 1, you can obtain a random position between the two points. Here's how you can do it: 1. **Define Your Points**: First, you must have the two points between which you want to find a random position. Let's assume these points are defined as \`Vector3\` variables named \`pointA\` and \`pointB\`. 2. **Generate a Random Factor**: Generate a random number between 0 and 1. This will act as the interpolant factor for the \`Lerp\` function. 3. **Use \`Vector3.Lerp\`**: Pass your points and the random factor to the \`Lerp\` function to get a random position between them. # Sample Unity C# Script: \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; public class RandomPositionBetweenPoints : MonoBehaviour { public Vector3 pointA; public Vector3 pointB; // This method returns a random position between pointA and pointB public Vector3 GetRandomPosition() { float randomFactor = Random.Range(0f, 1f); // Generate a random factor between 0 and 1 return Vector3.Lerp(pointA, pointB, randomFactor); // Return the interpolated vector } // Example usage void Start() { Vector3 randomPosition = GetRandomPosition(); Debug.Log(\\"Random Position: \\" + randomPosition); } } \`\`\` # Breakdown of the Key Components: - **\`Vector3 pointA, pointB;\`**: These are public variables that you can set from the Unity Editor to define the starting and ending points. - **\`float randomFactor = Random.Range(0f, 1f);\`**: This generates a random floating-point number between 0 and 1. - **\`Vector3.Lerp(pointA, pointB, randomFactor);\`**: This interpolates between \`pointA\` and \`pointB\` based on the \`randomFactor\`. A \`randomFactor\` of 0 will return \`pointA\`, a \`randomFactor\` of 1 will return \`pointB\`, and a \`randomFactor\` between 0 and 1 will return a point somewhere in between. - **\`Debug.Log()\`**: This line is merely for debugging purposes, to see the output in the console. You can attach this script to any GameObject in your scene, and then set the \`pointA\` and \`pointB\` from the inspector by dragging and dropping or manually setting the coordinates. Running the game will trigger \`Start()\`, which then logs a random position between \`pointA\` and \`pointB\` to the console. Remember, this is a simple example. Depending on your needs, you might want to adjust it. For example, if you're working in 2D, you would use \`Vector2\` and \`Vector2.Lerp\` instead."},{"prompt":"how to save corountine as variable","completion":"In Unity, coroutines are a powerful tool that allows you to perform actions over time without blocking the rest of your code execution. Sometimes, you might need to manage your coroutines more flexibly, such as stopping them from outside the method where they were started. To achieve this, you can save your coroutine as a variable. A coroutine in Unity is started with a call to \`StartCoroutine\`, which returns a \`Coroutine\` object. This object can be stored in a variable for later use, particularly for stopping the coroutine with \`StopCoroutine\`. Here’s how you can do it: # Step 1: Define a Coroutine Variable First, declare a variable of type \`Coroutine\` at the class level in your MonoBehaviour script. This will allow you to access the coroutine from any method within the class. \`\`\`csharp Coroutine myCoroutine; \`\`\` # Step 2: Start the Coroutine and Assign it to the Variable When you start the coroutine using \`StartCoroutine\`, assign the returned \`Coroutine\` object to your previously declared variable. \`\`\`csharp void StartSomeProcess() { myCoroutine = StartCoroutine(MyCoroutineMethod()); } \`\`\` # Example Coroutine Method \`\`\`csharp IEnumerator MyCoroutineMethod() { // Your coroutine code here yield return new WaitForSeconds(1); // Just an example of a delay Debug.Log(\\"Coroutine execution\\"); } \`\`\` # Step 3: Stop the Coroutine Using the Saved Variable You can now use the \`StopCoroutine\` method with your saved coroutine variable to stop it from executing further. \`\`\`csharp void StopSomeProcess() { if (myCoroutine != null) { StopCoroutine(myCoroutine); } } \`\`\` # Full Example Script \`\`\`csharp using System.Collections; using UnityEngine; public class CoroutineExample : MonoBehaviour { Coroutine myCoroutine; // Start is called before the first frame update void Start() { StartSomeProcess(); } void StartSomeProcess() { myCoroutine = StartCoroutine(MyCoroutineMethod()); } IEnumerator MyCoroutineMethod() { yield return new WaitForSeconds(1); Debug.Log(\\"Coroutine execution\\"); } void StopSomeProcess() { if (myCoroutine != null) { StopCoroutine(myCoroutine); } } // Example of stopping the coroutine from another action, // such as a user input or an event in the game void Update() { if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Space)) { StopSomeProcess(); } } } \`\`\` In this example, the coroutine starts running when the game begins via the \`Start\` method. It prints a message after a 1-second delay. If you press the spacebar (\`KeyCode.Space\`), it stops the coroutine, preventing further messages from being logged (if stopped within the 1-second delay). Saving coroutines as variables offers greater control over their execution, allowing you to manage their lifecycle according to your game’s logic."},{"prompt":"What happens to my variable when I call StopAllCorountines?","completion":"When you call \`StopAllCoroutines()\` on a MonoBehaviour in Unity, it immediately stops all coroutines that were started by that MonoBehaviour instance. However, it's important to understand what this means for any variables you might be using in conjunction with those coroutines, including those you've saved references to: 1. **Coroutines Stop Execution:** Any coroutine currently executing or scheduled to execute will be halted. This means that any code within those coroutines after the point of stoppage will not execute. 2. **Coroutine Variable Remains Unchanged:** If you have a \`Coroutine\` variable where you stored the reference returned by \`StartCoroutine\`, stopping the coroutine (either individually with \`StopCoroutine\` or all coroutines with \`StopAllCoroutines\`) does not nullify or clear that variable. The variable will still hold a reference to the \`Coroutine\` object, but this object is no longer active or meaningful in any way because the coroutine it refers to has been stopped. There is no direct way to check if a coroutine is \\"alive\\" or \\"stopped\\" using this reference. 3. **Implications:** Because calling \`StopAllCoroutines\` does not nullify your coroutine variables, if your code logic checks for the existence of these variables to determine if a coroutine is running (e.g., \`if (myCoroutine != null)\`), you might not get the intended behavior. The Coroutine reference being non-null does not indicate that the coroutine is still running. 4. **Best Practice:** If your logic depends on knowing whether a coroutine is active, you might need to manually manage this state. For example, you can set your coroutine variable to null after stopping it and check for nullity to know if your coroutine should be considered \\"not running.\\" # Example: Here's an example highlighting what happens and how you might manage coroutine state: \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; using System.Collections; public class ExampleScript : MonoBehaviour { private Coroutine myCoroutine; void Start() { myCoroutine = StartCoroutine(MyCoroutine()); } IEnumerator MyCoroutine() { while (true) // Infinite loop for demonstration { Debug.Log(\\"Coroutine is running.\\"); yield return new WaitForSeconds(1); } } void Update() { if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.S)) { StopAllCoroutines(); // This stops the coroutine myCoroutine = null; // Manually nullifying the variable } // A check to see if myCoroutine has been stopped (via null check) if (myCoroutine == null) { Debug.Log(\\"Coroutine has been stopped.\\"); } } } \`\`\` In this example, pressing the \`S\` key stops all coroutines and manually nullifies \`myCoroutine\`, allowing the rest of your logic to accurately reflect whether the coroutine is active based on the \`null\` check. A similar approach can be taken if you're stopping coroutines individually with \`StopCoroutine(myCoroutine)\`, instead of stopping all of them. Always consider the state management of any related variables and objects to ensure your application behaves as expected."},{"prompt":"I want a method given a wall return is the wall or neighbours are destroyed using its internal variable IsDestroyed. A neighbour is a wall that is next to the index of current wall left or right, if the wall is the first its neigbour is the second and the last element, something similar happens with the last element using System.Collections.Generic; using UnityEngine; namespace Game.Systems.Buildings { public class CityWalls : MonoBehaviour { [SerializeField] private List<Wall> walls; public List<Wall> Walls => walls; } }","completion":"Based on the requirements you've described, you're looking for a method that checks if a given wall, or its immediate neighbors, have been destroyed. This method will utilize the \`IsDestroyed\` property of the \`Wall\` objects in the list. You mentioned that neighbors are considered to be the wall elements directly adjacent (left or right) to a given index, with wrapping at the ends of the list so that the first and last elements are neighbors of each other. First, ensure your \`Wall\` class (not shown in your sample) has a public \`bool IsDestroyed\` property or field. I will assume such a property exists for this example. Next, you can add the following method to your \`CityWalls\` class. This method accepts an index for the specific wall and returns \`true\` if the wall or any of its immediate neighbors are destroyed. \`\`\`csharp using System.Collections.Generic; using UnityEngine; namespace Game.Systems.Buildings { public class CityWalls : MonoBehaviour { [SerializeField] private List<Wall> walls; public List<Wall> Walls => walls; // Check if a wall or its neighbors are destroyed public bool IsWallOrNeighborsDestroyed(int wallIndex) { if (walls == null || walls.Count == 0) return false; // No walls to check if (wallIndex < 0 || wallIndex >= walls.Count) throw new System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException(nameof(wallIndex), \\"Wall index is out of range.\\"); // Check the specified wall if (walls[wallIndex].IsDestroyed) return true; // Calculate neighbor indices with wrapping int leftNeighborIndex = (wallIndex == 0) ? walls.Count - 1 : wallIndex - 1; int rightNeighborIndex = (wallIndex == walls.Count - 1) ? 0 : wallIndex + 1; // Check left neighbor if (walls[leftNeighborIndex].IsDestroyed) return true; // Check right neighbor if (walls[rightNeighborIndex].IsDestroyed) return true; return false; // None are destroyed } } } \`\`\` Key Parts of the Method: - **Bounds Checking:** It initially ensures that the \`wallIndex\` provided is valid for the size of the \`walls\` list. This is crucial to avoid indexing errors. - **Neighbor Calculation with Wrapping:** The method correctly identifies the neighbors of a given wall, with logic to wrap around to the opposite end of the list if the wall is the first or last in the list. - **IsDestroyed Check:** For each of the wall and its neighbors, it checks the \`IsDestroyed\` property. If any are destroyed (\`true\`), the method immediately returns \`true\`. This added method allows you to determine if a specific wall, indicated by its index in the list, or any of its neighboring walls are destroyed, based on their \`IsDestroyed\` status. It respects the wrap-around behavior for the list's first and last elements as specified."},{"prompt":"What is given is a Wall not a wallindex","completion":"If you need to modify the method to accept a \`Wall\` object instead of a wall index, you can adjust the approach to first find the index of the given wall in the list, and then perform the same neighbor checks as before. Here's how you can implement this functionality: \`\`\`csharp using System.Collections.Generic; using UnityEngine; namespace Game.Systems.Buildings { public class CityWalls : MonoBehaviour { [SerializeField] private List<Wall> walls; public List<Wall> Walls => walls; // Check if a given wall or its neighbors are destroyed public bool IsWallOrNeighborsDestroyed(Wall targetWall) { if (walls == null || walls.Count == 0) return false; // No walls to check // Find the index of the target wall in the list int wallIndex = walls.IndexOf(targetWall); // Check if the wall is not part of the list if (wallIndex == -1) throw new System.ArgumentException(\\"The specified wall is not part of the walls list.\\", nameof(targetWall)); // Check the specified wall (redundant if you're directly passing the wall, but kept for consistency) if (targetWall.IsDestroyed) return true; // Calculate neighbor indices with wrapping int leftNeighborIndex = (wallIndex == 0) ? walls.Count - 1 : wallIndex - 1; int rightNeighborIndex = (wallIndex == walls.Count - 1) ? 0 : wallIndex + 1; // Check left neighbor if (walls[leftNeighborIndex].IsDestroyed) return true; // Check right neighbor if (walls[rightNeighborIndex].IsDestroyed) return true; return false; // None are destroyed } } // Assuming the Wall class looks something like this public class Wall : MonoBehaviour { public bool IsDestroyed; // Your mechanism to set this } } \`\`\` Key Modifications: - The method now expects a \`Wall\` object (\`targetWall\`) as its parameter instead of an \`int\` index. - It uses \`walls.IndexOf(targetWall)\` to find the index of the given \`Wall\` object within the list. \`IndexOf\` will return \`-1\` if the \`Wall\` object is not found, in which case, an \`ArgumentException\` is thrown as the wall is not part of the list. - The rest of the method proceeds as before, using the identified index to check if the given \`Wall\` or its neighbors are destroyed. By modifying the method in this way, you can directly pass a \`Wall\` object to check if it or its neighbors (by position in the \`walls\` list) are destroyed. This approach reduces the need to manage or know the index externally, instead focusing on the \`Wall\` objects themselves, making your code a bit cleaner and more intuitive to use from other parts of your Unity project."},{"prompt":"How to improve my code?

The suggestions below aim to streamline the class, reduce redundancy, and adhere to best practices for Unity game development. # Code Clarity and Organization 1. **Constructor Initialization for Lists:** Initialize collections like \`List\` in their declaration or the class constructor to ensure they are never null, reducing the need for null checks. 2. **Method Extraction:** Complex methods like \`Update\` and \`MoveToAttackTarget\` should be broken down into smaller, more manageable functions. This increases readability and reusability. 3. **Use Pattern Matching:** Leverage C# pattern matching for type checks when casting, to make your type checks cleaner and more readable. 4. **Component Caching:** Cache components (e.g., \`ObjectHealth\`, \`BuildingHealth\`, \`UnitHealth\`) if accessed multiple times, to improve performance by avoiding repeated \`GetComponent\` calls. # Performance Considerations 1. **Reducing GetComponent Calls:** \`GetComponent\` is relatively expensive. Cache component references obtained in \`Start\` or \`Awake\` if they're used frequently. 2. **OverlapSphere Optimization:** Consider using non-alloc versions of physics checks (like \`Physics.OverlapSphereNonAlloc\`) to reduce garbage collection pressure. Preallocate an array to store results and reuse it. 3. **Coroutines and Garbage Collection:** Be mindful of creating garbage in coroutines running every frame. Avoid creating new objects or arrays in such loops. # Code Example Refinements Here's an example showing some of the suggested changes: \`\`\`csharp // Reduced the scope of the example for brevity public void Init(List<EnemyCheckpoint> checkpoints) { ai = GetComponent<IAstarAI>(); // Improved constructor initialization this.checkpoints = checkpoints ?? new List<EnemyCheckpoint>(); currentIndex = 0; animationController = GetComponent<AnimationStateController>(); state = UnitBase.CharacterState.Walking; rvoController = GetComponent<RVOController>(); unitHealth = GetComponent<UnitHealth>(); unitHealth.Init(maxHealth); // Simplify subscription unitHealth.OnZeroHealth += Die; aiState = UnitBase.AIState.Idle; GameManager.Instance.EnemyManager.AddEnemy(); // Use method extraction for initialization tasks StartFirstCheckpointMovement(); } private void StartFirstCheckpointMovement() { if (checkpoints.Any()) { currentCheckpointPosition = checkpoints[currentIndex].GetPosition(); checkpointCoroutine = StartCoroutine(MoveToCheckpoint(checkpoints[currentIndex])); } } private IEnumerator MoveToCheckpoint(EnemyCheckpoint checkpoint = null) { // Example of method extraction simplification SetupMovementToCheckpoint(checkpoint); // Wait loop simplified for example's focus while (ai.pathPending || !ai.reachedEndOfPath) { // Conditional complexity reduced for example, focus on structure yield return null; } ProcessArrivalAtCheckpoint(); } private void SetupMovementToCheckpoint(EnemyCheckpoint checkpoint) { // Simplify movement setup to checkpoint } private void ProcessArrivalAtCheckpoint() { // Simplify processing of arrival logic } private void Die(object sender, EventArgs e) { // Example method content reduced for brevity, focusing on structure gameObject.SetActive(false); GameManager.Instance.EnemyManager.RemoveEnemy(); // Cleanup subscriptions to avoid memory leaks unitHealth.OnZeroHealth -= Die; } // Always unsubscribe in OnDestroy instead of OnDisable for permanent subscriptions void OnDestroy() { if (unitHealth != null) { unitHealth.OnZeroHealth -= Die; } } \`\`\` # Additional Tips - **Testing:** Regularly test for regressions, especially after refactoring or optimizing. - **Profiling:** Use Unity's Profiler to identify performance bottlenecks. - **Readability vs. Performance:** Find the right balance between code readability and performance, favoring readability unless profiling indicates a performance issue.

These include the diversity of compression algorithms optimized for specific types of data, the variance in the quality and resolution of source images and videos, and the different objectives that these compression methods might prioritize (e.g., compression efficiency, visual quality, decompression speed). However, I can provide a high-level overview and some insights into what might influence these comparisons: # Video Compression: 1. **Efficiency through Temporal Redundancy**: Video compression techniques, especially those using SOTA methods like HEVC (H.265) or AV1, are highly efficient because they exploit both spatial and temporal redundancy. Temporal redundancy allows these algorithms to significantly reduce the amount of data required to represent a sequence of frames, as many frames are similar or only slightly different from their predecessors. This means after the initial frame(s), subsequent frames often require considerably fewer bits to describe the changes rather than the entire frame. 2. **Optimization for Motion**: These codecs are optimized for typical video content, which includes motion. They use techniques such as motion vectors and prediction to achieve high compression rates while maintaining acceptable visual quality. 3. **Quality Adaptation**: Video compression often aims to maintain a balance between compression efficiency and visual quality, with options to prioritize one or the other depending on the application (e.g., streaming at low bandwidths vs. archival storage). # Image Compression (Grouped): 1. **Spatial Redundancy**: When compressing images as a group, methods like FLIF (Free Lossless Image Format) or newer approaches leveraging deep learning can be very efficient at finding and exploiting similarities (spatial redundancy) across images. These methods can achieve high compression ratios especially if the images have commonalities. However, unlike video compression, there's no temporal component to exploit, which might limit the compression efficiency compared to video in certain contexts. 2. **Optimization for Variability**: Image compression algorithms must be robust across a wide range of image types (photos, graphics, text, etc.). Advanced methods use adaptive techniques and may leverage machine learning to optimize compression on a per-image or per-group basis. 3. **Quality Retention**: For web images, lossy compression techniques (like JPEG or WebP) are commonly used to drastically reduce file size at the cost of some loss in quality. Newer formats like AVIF (based on AV1) balance high compression rates with minimal quality loss more effectively. # Comparison: - **Temporal vs. Spatial Efficiency**: Video compression can often achieve lower bpp rates due to its ability to compress across frames (temporal efficiency), not just within them (spatial efficiency). However, for a set or group of images with significant commonalities, advanced group compression techniques might approach or even exceed the efficiency of temporal compression, albeit this is highly dependent on the content and technique used. - **Content Dependency**: The exact content of the videos or image sets greatly influences the achievable compression rates. Videos with minimal motion or change between frames might compress more efficiently than a diverse set of high-detail, uncorrelated images. - **Usage of SOTA Methods**: The most advanced algorithms, whether for video or grouped image compression, leverage deep learning and other sophisticated strategies to optimize compression. The effectiveness of these methods continues to evolve rapidly, with newer approaches regularly setting new benchmarks for compression efficiency. In summary, while video compression might generally offer better compression rates on a per-frame basis due to the ability to leverage temporal redundancy, the comparison to grouped image compression depends heavily on the specific content and the algorithms used. For highly similar images or when using cutting-edge compression methods designed to exploit similarities across images, grouped image compression might perform comparably well. Nonetheless, the inherent advantage of temporal redundancy in videos typically presents a more significant opportunity for compression, especially with constant technological advancements in video codecs."},{"prompt":"Estimate the multiplicative factor difference for your best estimate for each of the 2 quantities asked about in the last question.","completion":"Given the constraints and the variability involved in the scenarios described earlier, I'll attempt to provide a rough estimate of the multiplicative factor difference in compression efficiency between video frames and grouped images. Due to the lack of specific data points and the wide range of potential outcomes based on the type of content, compression algorithms, and settings used, this estimate should be taken as a very general and speculative comparison. # For Video Compression: Assuming state-of-the-art video compression methods are employed (like HEVC/H.265 or AV1) for a typical video (which includes a mix of high motion and static scenes) being efficiently compressed, let's consider a general effective compression range. In highly optimized scenarios, modern video compression techniques can achieve astonishingly low bits per pixel (bpp) rates, especially for low-motion scenes or when applying aggressive compression that still retains acceptable visual quality. - Let's assume an average **range of 0.1 to 0.5 bpp** for high-quality video compression using SOTA methods, acknowledging that this can vary widely based on content, desired quality, and the specific codec's efficiency. # For Grouped Image Compression: Grouped image compression, using the most advanced techniques that leverage similarities between images and possibly even employing neural network-based methods, can significantly reduce the storage requirement. However, it lacks the advantage of temporal redundancy that video compression benefits from. Assuming we're working with a diverse set of images, but finding commonalities due to being grouped and compressed together: - An educated guess might place grouped image compression in a **range that could be slightly less efficient on average than video, say around 0.2 to 0.8 bpp**, depending on the algorithm's ability to exploit similarities and the heterogeneity of the image set. # Rough Multiplicative Factor Estimate: Given the wide ranges and the speculative nature of the estimates: - For the lower end, comparing 0.1 bpp (video) to 0.2 bpp (image), the multiplicative factor could be around **2x** in favor of video (indicating video could be twice as efficient in this best-case scenario). - For the upper comparison, 0.5 bpp (video) to 0.8 bpp (image), the factor reduces to about **1.6x** in favor of video. # Conclusion: Expect a multiplicative factor in the ballpark of **1.6x to 2x**, suggesting that, under these speculated and highly general conditions, video compression might be approximately 1.6 to 2 times more efficient than the most advanced grouped image compression techniques on average. This is a speculative analysis that highly depends on specific conditions and advancements in compression technologies. Actual results could vary notably, making this a starting point for more detailed comparisons based on concrete data."},{"prompt":"Hi. pretend to be a business coach and project manager for our conversation today.

How effectively candidates have networked and possibly received internal recommendations could impact their opportunities. **Conclusion:** There's no clear-cut answer as to which candidate is better positioned for a top investment banking (IB) firm job, as both have compelling attributes. The political science major brings a high GPA and a potentially unique viewpoint to the table, which, combined with a foundation in business or accounting, makes them a strong candidate. On the other hand, the Mendoza finance major offers direct relevance and specialized training in finance, which is inherently valuable to IB firms. Ultimately, it would depend on how each candidate leverages their strengths, communicates their value proposition, and fits with the specific needs and culture of the hiring firm. In the intensely competitive investment banking recruitment landscape, personal branding, the ability to network effectively, and stellar interview performance are just as crucial as academic background and GPA."},{"prompt":"But I heard IB firm does not care about major?","completion":"That's correct to an extent; investment banking (IB) firms are known for their openness regarding the academic backgrounds of their candidates, especially top firms that emphasize a diverse workforce to bring a variety of perspectives and solutions to their business challenges. The primary reason for this openness is that many of the skills necessary for success in investment banking can be learned on the job or through training programs provided by the firms themselves. These skills include financial modeling, valuation, and deal structuring, among others. What IB firms often care more about are the qualities that indicate a candidate's potential for success in the high-pressure environment of investment banking. These qualities include: - **Analytical and Quantitative Skills**: The ability to analyze data and financial statements, draw conclusions, and make compelling arguments based on that analysis is crucial. While these skills are often developed in finance, economics, and business programs, they can also be found in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) majors, and sometimes even in humanities majors who have a propensity for analytical thinking. - **Work Ethic and Resilience**: The willingness to work long hours under tight deadlines and the ability to remain resilient under pressure are highly valued. - **Teamwork and Interpersonal Skills**: Given the collaborative nature of the work, being able to work well in teams and maintain strong relationships with colleagues and clients is essential. - **Leadership**: Experience that demonstrates leadership potential can be particularly compelling, as the ability to take initiative and manage projects or teams is crucial in the fast-paced environment of investment banking. - **Communication Skills**: Both written and verbal communication skills are paramount, as professionals in this industry need to articulate complex ideas clearly and persuasively to clients and colleagues. Given these priorities, it's clear that while a major in finance or business may provide direct exposure to relevant knowledge, it's the demonstration of the above characteristics — through academic achievements, internships, extracurricular activities, and during interviews — that truly matter. A candidate from a non-traditional background (like a Political Science major) who possesses these qualities and has taken steps to develop a foundational understanding of business and finance (e.g., through a minor, relevant electives, or self-study) can be just as competitive, if not more so, by offering a diverse perspective. In the end, what IB firms are looking for are capable, motivated individuals who can thrive in their demanding environment. Demonstrating your potential through a combination of academic achievements, relevant experiences, and personal qualities is the key to capturing their interest, regardless of your major."},{"prompt":"so GPA higher is better in this case?","completion":"In the context of investment banking (IB) recruitment, a higher GPA can certainly be advantageous, but it's one of several factors considered during the hiring process. The reason GPA matters is that it serves as a straightforward metric for gauging a candidate’s academic performance and work ethic, which are qualities investment banks value given the demanding nature of the job. A high GPA can indicate strong analytical skills, discipline, and the ability to manage a heavy workload — all critical in investment banking. However, the importance of GPA is not absolute and can vary depending on the firm, the specific role, and the overall candidate profile. Here’s how GPA factors into the broader picture: 1. **Threshold Screening**: Some IB firms might use GPA as a screening tool, setting a minimum threshold for applications (e.g., 3.5 on a 4.0 scale) to manage the high volume of applicants. Meeting or exceeding this threshold ensures that your application advances in the selection process, but it's the first of many criteria. 2. **Holistic Review**: Beyond the initial screening, firms adopt a holistic approach to assess candidates. This means they consider a range of factors, including internships, leadership experiences, extracurricular activities, technical skills, and how well candidates perform in interviews. Exceptional achievements in these areas can sometimes offset a GPA that's lower than a firm's typical preference. 3. **Context Matters**: Firms often consider the context of a candidate’s GPA. They might take into account the rigor of the academic program, the university’s grading standards, or whether the candidate pursued multiple degrees, challenging majors, or had extensive extracurricular commitments. Similarly, improvements in academic performance over time or excellence in courses relevant to finance can also positively influence the perception of a candidate’s GPA. 4. **Personal Qualities**: Investment banking values personal attributes such as ambition, resilience, teamwork, leadership, and communication skills. Your ability to convey these traits through your resume, cover letter, and especially during interviews can have a significant impact on your application's success. 5. **Networking and Referrals**: Networking and building relationships with professionals in the industry can lead to referrals, which might give you an edge in the recruitment process. Often, a strong referral from a trusted employee can prompt a closer look at a candidate who might not meet all traditional criteria, including having a slightly lower GPA. In conclusion, while a higher GPA is generally better and can strengthen your application, it's not the only criterion for success in securing an IB position. Demonstrating a well-rounded profile, industry knowledge, relevant experience, and strong interpersonal skills can compensate for a GPA that might not be at the top of the range. The key is to excel in areas within your control and effectively communicate your enthusiasm and fit for the role and the firm during the recruitment process."},{"prompt":"hello","completion":"Hello!

Szyfrowanie polega na przesuwaniu kolejnych liter z wejściowego ciągu znaków o kolejną liczbę pobraną z klucza. Każdorazowe użycie liczby z klucza powoduje przesunięcie indeksu klucza o jeden do przodu, za wyjątkiem ostatniego znaku, kiedy indeks przesuwa się na początek.

Инструкции: 1. Скачайте исходный код пакета напрямую с репозитория или PyPI. 2. Исправьте ошибку в коде (в данном случае, возможно, потребуется исправить импорт в файле \`base.py\`). 3. Установите пакет локально через \`pip install /path/to/fixed/package\`. # Обращение к автору пакета Разумный шаг — обратиться к автору или команде, поддерживающей \`imaplib3\`, через систему issue на GitHub или другом хостинге исходного кода, если таковая имеется. Ошибка, с которой вы столкнулись, может быть уже известна, и возможно, существует решение или планируется исправление. # Проверка совместимости версий Удостоверьтесь, что ваша среда Python совместима с \`imaplib3\`. Возможно, библиотека требует определенной версии Python, которая не соответствует установленной у вас. # Заключение Фактически, выбор правильного действия зависит от ваших требований и возможностей. Если вы можете использовать альтернативную библиотеку, это будет самым простым решением. В противном случае, попробуйте обратиться за помощью к сообществу или исправить ошибку самостоятельно."},{"prompt":"Generate an image of A 2013 matte green Range rover racing a matte black sport bike yamaha r6. the is a dirt road with a sunset.","completion":"I'm sorry, but I can't create images or visual content. However, I can help describe how the scene might look: Imagine a wide, unpaved dirt road stretching towards the horizon, where the sun dips low, casting a fiery glow that illuminates the scene in warm orange and red tones. Dust is kicked up behind the vehicles, mingling with the sunlight to create a hazy, almost magical atmosphere. On the left, a matte green 2013 Range Rover powers down the road, its large, sturdy frame contrasting sharply with the sleek, nimble form of a matte black Yamaha R6 sport bike to its right. The Range Rover, with its rugged appearance and commanding presence, contrasts with the streamlined, aggressive stance of the R6, which looks like it's slicing through the air. The driver of the Range Rover, focused and determined, is partially visible through the tinted windows, while the rider on the R6 is hunched low over the tank, helmet reflecting the last rays of the sun, as both push their vehicles to the limit. The dust swirling behind them and their shadows elongate on the dirt road, combining speed, the thrill of the race, and the beauty of the surrounding landscape into a moment frozen in time, epitomizing the essence of adventure and competition."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:R},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:D,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const o=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return o?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.prompt&&e.prompt.toLowerCase().includes(o)||e.completion&&e.completion.toLowerCase().includes(o)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"search-container"},U={class:"card-container"},G={key:0,class:"empty-state"},H=["disabled"],x={key:0},L={key:1};function F(o,e,h,m,n,s){const g=p("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",M,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>n.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,n.searchQuery]]),n.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>n.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",U,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,f)=>(a(),T(g,{key:f,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",G,' No results found for "'+d(n.searchQuery)+'".
