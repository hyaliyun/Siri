We need to prove that tan(alpha/2) is rational if and only if cos(alpha) and sin(alpha) are rational. 1. First, we define ( t = tan(alpha/2) ). 2. Using the half-angle formulas for sine and cosine, we get: [ cos(alpha) = frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2} ] and [ sin(alpha) = frac{2t}{1+t^2} ] 3. **(⇒ Direction)**: - Assume ( t = tan(alpha/2) ) is rational. - Substituting ( t ) into the half-angle formulas: [ cos(alpha) = frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2} ] and [ sin(alpha) = frac{2t}{1+t^2} ] - Since ( t ) is rational, it follows that ( t^2 ) is also rational. Thus, the expressions ( 1-t^2 ) and ( 1+t^2 ) are rational. - Therefore, since both the numerator and denominator are rational, ( cos(alpha) ) and ( sin(alpha) ) are both rational. 4. **(⇐ Direction)**: - Assume ( cos(alpha) ) and ( sin(alpha) ) are rational. - Denote ( cos(alpha) = k ) and ( sin(alpha) = m ), where ( k ) and ( m ) are rational numbers. - Recall the identity ( k^2 + m^2 = 1 ). Since ( k ) and ( m ) are rational, ( k^2 + m^2 ) must also be rational. Hence, it is equal to 1. - From the identity ( sin(2theta) = 2sin(theta)cos(theta) ) and ( cos(2theta) = cos^2(theta) - sin^2(theta) ), we write: [ cos(alpha) = cos^2(alpha/2) - sin^2(alpha/2) ] [ sin(alpha) = 2 sin(alpha/2) cos(alpha/2) ] - Using the substitution ( t = tan(alpha/2) ): [ t = frac{sin(alpha/2)}{cos(alpha/2)} ] - The expression ( cos(alpha) = frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2} ) implies replacing ( k ) with ( frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2} ). Rearranging for ( t^2 ): [ k = cos(alpha) = frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2} ] [ k(1+t^2) = 1-t^2 ] [ k + kt^2 = 1 - t^2 ] [ kt^2 + t^2 = 1 - k ] [ t^2(1 + k) = 1 - k ] [ t^2 = frac{1 - k}{1 + k} ] - Since ( k = cos(alpha) ) is rational and ( k neq -1 ) (as (alpha) is not an odd multiple of pi), ( frac{1 - k}{1 + k} ) is a rational number implying ( t^2 ) is rational. 5.

Based on the given conditions of the previous question, if the golden rod changes uniformly from thick to thin, estimate the total weight of this golden rod to be approximately ____ catties.","completion":"To solve this problem, we first understand that the weights of each section of the golden rod form an arithmetic progression (AP) because the rod changes uniformly from thick to thin. Given that when one foot is cut from the end, it weighs 2 catties, we can consider this as the first term of our AP, which we denote as a_1 = 2 catties. Similarly, when one foot is cut from the base, it weighs 4 catties. Since the rod is 5 feet long, this measurement corresponds to the fifth term in our AP, which we denote as a_5 = 4 catties. The formula for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic progression is given by S_n = frac{n}{2} times (a_1 + a_n), where a_1 is the first term, a_n is the nth term, and n is the number of terms. In this case, we want to find the total weight of the golden rod, which is the sum of the weights of all 5 sections. Therefore, we have n = 5, a_1 = 2, and a_5 = 4.

We can use the information about the time it takes to pass the platform to find this. When the train passes the platform, it covers a distance equal to its own length plus the length of the platform. So the total distance covered when passing the platform is: Distance = Length of train + Length of platform Distance = 1200 m + 700 m Distance = 1900 m We are given that it takes 190 seconds to pass the platform. Therefore, we can calculate the speed of the train (Speed = Distance / Time): Speed = 1900 m / 190 s Speed = 10 m/s Now that we have the speed of the train, we can calculate the time it takes to cross the tree. When crossing the tree, the train only needs to cover its own length, which is 1200 m.

The area of rectangle BDEF is then computed as [(2+sqrt{5})(4+2sqrt{5}) = 8 + 4sqrt{5} + 4sqrt{5} + 10 = 18 + 8sqrt{5}.] Finally, area of the octagon: [18 + 8sqrt{5} - 4 = boxed{14 + 8sqrt{5}}.]"},{"prompt":"A rhombus has diagonals of 13 cm and 20 cm, and the angle between the diagonals is θ degrees.

This means that each diagonal is divided into two equal segments at the point where they intersect. Let's denote the length of one half of the first diagonal (13 cm) as d1/2 and the length of one half of the second diagonal (20 cm) as d2/2. So we have: d1/2 = 13 cm / 2 = 6.5 cm d2/2 = 20 cm / 2 = 10 cm Each side of the rhombus can be found by applying the Pythagorean theorem to one of the right-angled triangles formed by the diagonals. The sides of the rhombus are the hypotenuses of these triangles. The length of a side (s) of the rhombus is given by: s = √((d1/2)² + (d2/2)²) s = √((6.5 cm)² + (10 cm)²) s = √(42.25 cm² + 100 cm²) s = √(142.25 cm²) s = 11.93 cm (approximately) Now, to find the area (A) of the rhombus, we can use the formula that involves the lengths of the diagonals: A = (d1 * d2) / 2 A = (13 cm * 20 cm) / 2 A = (260 cm²) / 2 A = 130 cm² So, the side lengths of the rhombus are approximately 11.93 cm, and the area of the rhombus is boxed{130} cm²."},{"prompt":"Given three distinct real numbers a , b , and c , show that at least two of the three following equations [(xa)(xb)=xc] [(xc)(xb)=xa] [(xc)(xa)=xb] have real solutions.","completion":"1. We start by assuming, for the sake of contradiction, that at most one of the given equations has real solutions. Without loss of generality, assume that the first two equations have no real roots. This means that their discriminants must be non-positive. 2. Consider the first equation: [ (x-a)(x-b) = x-c ] Expanding and rearranging terms, we get: [ x^2 - (a+b)x + ab = x - c implies x^2 - (a+b+1)x + (ab+c) = 0 ] The discriminant of this quadratic equation is: [ Delta_1 = (a+b+1)^2 - 4(ab+c) ] Since we assumed this equation has no real roots, we have: [ (a+b+1)^2 - 4(ab+c) leq 0 ] 3. Now consider the second equation: [ (x-c)(x-b) = x-a ] Expanding and rearranging terms, we get: [ x^2 - (b+c)x + bc = x - a implies x^2 - (b+c+1)x + (bc+a) = 0 ] The discriminant of this quadratic equation is: [ Delta_2 = (b+c+1)^2 - 4(bc+a) ] Since we assumed this equation also has no real roots, we have: [ (b+c+1)^2 - 4(bc+a) leq 0 ] 4. Adding the two inequalities: [ (a+b+1)^2 - 4(ab+c) + (b+c+1)^2 - 4(bc+a) leq 0 ] Simplifying the left-hand side: [ (a+b+1)^2 + (b+c+1)^2 - 4(ab+c) - 4(bc+a) ] Expanding the squares: [ (a^2 + 2ab + b^2 + 2a + 2b + 1) + (b^2 + 2bc + c^2 + 2b + 2c + 1) - 4ab - 4c - 4bc - 4a ] Combining like terms: [ a^2 + 2b^2 + c^2 + 2a + 4b + 2c + 2 - 4ab - 4bc - 4a - 4c ] Simplifying further: [ a^2 + 2b^2 + c^2 - 4ab - 4bc + 2b - 2a - 2c + 2 ] Grouping terms: [ (a - b - 1)^2 + (c - b - 1)^2 leq 0 ] 5.

To factorize, we consider the given form and realize it must match the quadratic form (x - alpha)(x - beta) < 0. Comparing this with the given inequality, we identify alpha = a and beta = 1 based on the standard (x - root1)(x - root2) format of factorizing quadratics. 2. Thus, we rewrite the inequality as left(x-aright)left(x-1right) lt 0. 3. Given the solution set is b < x < 2, the roots of the corresponding equation left(x-aright)left(x-1right) = 0 must be x = b and x = 2. 4. Therefore, by setting the roots equal to the respective values, we find a = 2 and b = 1.

Substituting the found values of a and b into the equation, we get frac{2}{x}+frac{1}{y}=1. 2. We seek the minimum value of x+2y under these conditions, knowing that it should satisfy x+2y≥sqrt{k}-frac{9}{sqrt{k}}. 3. Multiplying both sides of the equation frac{2}{x}+frac{1}{y}=1 by (x+2y), we get (x+2y)(frac{2}{x}+frac{1}{y}) = 2 + frac{x}{y} + frac{4y}{x} + 2. 4. By the AM-GM inequality, frac{x}{y} + frac{4y}{x} geq 2sqrt{frac{x}{y} cdot frac{4y}{x}} = 4. 5. Thus, (x+2y)(frac{2}{x}+frac{1}{y}) geq 8, indicating that the minimum possible value for (x+2y) is 8. 6. For 8 to be the minimum, it must satisfy 8≥sqrt{k}-frac{9}{sqrt{k}}. Rearranging and solving the quadratic inequality k-8sqrt{k}-9 leq 0 with the condition k>0, we find the permissible range for k. 7. Solving the quadratic inequality, we find that 0 < k leq 81.

Since each large plank needs 14 nails and John is using 12 large planks, the total number of nails for the large planks is: 12 large planks * 14 nails per large plank = 168 nails Now, we know that John needs 29 planks in total for the house wall. Since he is using 12 large planks, the remaining number of planks must be small planks. So, the number of small planks is: 29 total planks - 12 large planks = 17 small planks We are not given the total number of nails needed for the small planks, but we can assume that the total number of nails for the small planks is the same as the total number of nails for the large planks, which is 168 nails. Therefore, if we divide the total number of nails for the small planks by the number of small planks, we can find out how many nails each small plank needs: 168 nails / 17 small planks = 9.88 nails per small plank Since we can't have a fraction of a nail, we can round this number to the nearest whole number.

The caregivers distinguish between children but do not distinguish between the trees: two such divisions into round dances are considered the same if one can be obtained from the other by swapping the trees (along with the corresponding round dances) and rotating each of the round dances around its tree.

Each child can either go around Tree 1 or Tree 2. - Calculating these combinations means calculating the non-trivial partitions where neither group is empty. The number of non-empty partitions of 5 children into 2 groups is given by ( 2^5 - 2 ).

Essentially, every configuration is counted twice.

A group with ( k ) members if set in a circle is invariant under ( k ) rotations. Therefore, for each group configuration, we need to divide by the number of children in that group to discount these repeated counts. - For example, denote the number of children in one group by ( k ) and the other group by ( 5 - k ). - These groups can respectively be rotated in ( k ) and ( 5 - k ) ways.

This means the discriminant must be negative: [ Delta = [alpha(a+b) + beta(c+d)]^2 - 4(alpha + beta)(alpha ab + beta cd) < 0 ] 6. **Simplify the discriminant condition:** Let alpha = 1 (without loss of generality, since the equation is homogeneous in alpha and beta). Then we need: [ [(a+b) + beta(c+d)]^2 < 4(1 + beta)(ab + beta cd) ] Expanding and simplifying, we get: [ (a+b)^2 + 2beta(a+b)(c+d) + beta^2(c+d)^2 < 4(ab + beta cd + beta ab + beta^2 cd) ] [ (a+b)^2 + 2beta(a+b)(c+d) + beta^2(c+d)^2 < 4ab + 4beta cd + 4beta ab + 4beta^2 cd ] 7. **Analyze the inequality:** Notice that the leading coefficient of beta^2 is (c+d)^2 - 4cd, which is negative since (c-d)^2 geq 0. The constant term is (a+b)^2 - 4ab = (a-b)^2, which is also non-negative.

Every move Kolya makes henceforth will be reflected symmetrically with respect to ( O ). That is, if Kolya marks point ( A ), Vitya will mark point ( A' ) such that ( O ) is the midpoint of the line segment ( AA' ). # Detailed Analysis: - Vitya's strategy ensures that every time a new node is marked, all marked nodes remain vertices of a convex polygon. This is because the reflection of any point across a fixed center maintains the convexity property. - After Kolya and Vitya each make three moves, they will have collectively marked six nodes in total. With this strategy, these six nodes will form a centrally symmetric hexagon. - The central symmetry of the hexagon means future player moves are constrained to lie within the triangular sectors formed by the sides of the hexagon and their extensions. # Final Steps: 4. As a result of this symmetry and consecutive reflections, Kolya will eventually run out of legal moves (nodes that can be marked while maintaining the convexity condition) before Vitya does. 5. The constraints placed by the centrally symmetric strategy result in a finite set of possible moves for Kolya, meaning Kolya will be the first to encounter a situation where no further legal move is possible. # Conclusion: Vitya is guaranteed to win the game if both players follow optimal play strategies.

Then (B geq A). If (s = t), this forces the two representations to be exactly the same, which is a contradiction. If (s < t), this implies (b_i = 0) for all (i in {s+1, s+2, ldots, t}), since we must have (A = B). This is also a contradiction, since we assumed both representations to be free of trailing zeroes. - Therefore, the set ({i in mathbb{N}, i leq s : a_i neq b_i}) is non-empty, and we can take its minimum to be (q). We observe that: [ A - B = left(frac{a_q}{q!} + frac{a_{q+1}}{(q+1)!} + cdots + frac{a_s}{s!}right) - left(frac{b_q}{q!} + frac{b_{q+1}}{(q+1)!} + cdots + frac{b_t}{t!}right) ] [ left|frac{a_q}{q!} - frac{b_q}{q!}right| geq frac{1}{q!} ] and [ sum_{j=1}^{infty} left|frac{a_{q+j}}{(q+j)!} - frac{b_{q+j}}{(q+j)!}right| leq sum_{j=1}^{infty} frac{(q+j-1)}{(q+j)!} = sum_{j=1}^{infty} frac{1}{(q+j-1)!} - sum_{j=1}^{infty} frac{1}{(q+j)!} = frac{1}{q!} ] (Define (a_j = 0) if (j > s) and (b_j = 0) if (j > t)). - So for (A - B) to be (0), we must have equalities in both the inequalities, and the latter equality would force one of (s) and (t) to be infinite, which is a contradiction. - Thus, a rational number can have at most one such representation. 2. **Existence of such a representation**: - We will prove it for rational numbers in ((0,1)), from which the result would follow for any rational number (r) by taking (a_1 = lfloor r rfloor) and keeping the rest of the (a_i)s the same as that in the representation of ({r}). - To show that the proper fraction (frac{m}{n}) (in reduced form) has such a representation, we write: [ frac{m}{n} = frac{m(n-1)!}{n!} ] - Now we observe that the expression (a_1 + frac{a_2}{2!} + frac{a_3}{3!} + cdots + frac{a_n}{n!}) can take exactly ((n! - 1)) distinct values when (a_1 = 0) and (a_2) to (a_n) vary within their specified bounds. This holds because (a_i) can take (i) values for each (i = 2, 3, ldots, n), and the uniqueness of this representation guarantees (2 times 3 times cdots times n = n!) distinct values for the expression, including (0). - So, this expression can take ((n! - 1)) distinct positive rational values, from (frac{1}{n!}) to (frac{(n! - 1)}{n!}). This proves that (frac{m(n-1)!}{n!}) can be achieved by taking (a_1 = 0) and a suitable combination of (a_2) to (a_n). - Finally, note that (1) has such a representation given by (a_1 = 1).

Notice that: [ -1 = e^{ipi + 2kpi i} quad text{for} quad k = 0, 1, 2, ldots, 6 ] Thus, the roots can be expressed as: [ e^{i(pi/7 + 2kpi/7)} quad text{for} quad k = 0, 1, 2, ldots, 6 ] Specifically, the roots are (e^{ipi/7}, e^{i3pi/7}, e^{i5pi/7}, e^{i9pi/7}, e^{i11pi/7}, e^{i13pi/7}). 2. **Sum of the roots**: By Vieta's formulas, the sum of the roots of (x^7 + 1 = 0) must be zero, since there is no (x^6) term: [ e^{ipi/7} + e^{i3pi/7} + e^{i5pi/7} + e^{i9pi/7} + e^{i11pi/7} + e^{i13pi/7} = -1 ] Since (cos(theta) = Re(e^{itheta})) and (sin(theta) = Im(e^{itheta})), only the real parts need to be considered for cosine summation. 3. **Pairing the cosines**: Notice that the roots can be paired due to the symmetry of the cosine function: [ cos frac{7pi}{7} = -1 ] [ cos frac{pi}{7} + cos frac{13pi}{7} = cos frac{pi}{7} + cos left(2pi - frac{pi}{7} right) = cos frac{pi}{7} + cos frac{pi}{7} = 2cos frac{pi}{7} ] [ cos frac{3pi}{7} + cos frac{11pi}{7} = cos frac{3pi}{7} + cos left(2pi - frac{3pi}{7}right) = cos frac{3pi}{7} + cos frac{3pi}{7} = 2cos frac{3pi}{7} ] [ cos frac{5pi}{7} + cos frac{9pi}{7} = cos frac{5pi}{7} + cos left(2pi - frac{5pi}{7} right) = cos frac{5pi}{7} + cos frac{5pi}{7} = 2cos frac{5pi}{7} ] We have: [ cos frac{pi}{7} + cos frac{3pi}{7} + cos frac{5pi}{7} = -frac{1}{2} ] 4. **Adjusting signs within cosine pairs**: Given that (cos (pi - x) = -cos (x)), adjust the equation as follows: [ cos frac{5pi}{7} = -cos frac{2pi}{7} ] Substituting in, we find: [ cos frac{pi}{7} - cos frac{2pi}{7} + cos frac{3pi}{7} = frac{1}{2} ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{cos frac{pi}{7} - cos frac{2pi}{7} + cos frac{3pi}{7} = frac{1}{2}} ]"},{"prompt":"f y<0, find the range of all possible values of y such that lceil{y}rceilcdotlfloor{y}rfloor=110.

This is because lceil{y}rceil is the smallest integer greater than y, and lfloor{y}rfloor is the largest integer less than or equal to y. For non-integer values of y, these two are consecutive integers. 2. **Substitute and Formulate the Equation:** Substituting these expressions into the given equation, we get: [ x(x-1) = 110 ] Simplifying this equation, we find: [ x^2 - x = 110 Rightarrow x^2 - x - 110 = 0 ] This is a quadratic equation in standard form. 3. **Solve the Quadratic Equation:** Solving the quadratic equation (x-11)(x+10) = 0, we find the roots x = 11 and x = -10. 4. **Apply the Given Condition (y<0):** Since y is less than 0, lceil{y}rceil (which we've denoted as x) cannot be positive. Therefore, we discard x = 11 and keep x = -10. 5. **Determine the Range of y:** Given x = lceil{y}rceil = -10 and x-1 = lfloor{y}rfloor = -11, y must lie between -11 and -10. This is because y cannot reach -10 (as it would then be rounded up to -10), nor can it be less than -11 (as it would then be rounded down to -11). 6. **Express the Answer in Interval Notation:** Therefore, the range of all possible values of y is -11 < y < -10.

Simplifying this, we get the trajectory equation of C: boxed{frac{x^2}{4} + y^2 = 1}. (II) Let M(x_1, y_1) and N(x_2, y_2). Solving the system of equations begin{cases} y = kx + m frac{x^2}{4} + y^2 = 1, end{cases} we obtain (4k^2 + 1)x^2 + 8kmx + 4m^2 - 4 = 0. Its discriminant Delta must be positive for real solutions: Delta = (8km)^2 - 4(4k^2+1)(4m^2-4) > 0. Simplifying, we get m^2 < 4k^2 + 1. Now, we know that x_1 + x_2 = -frac{8km}{4k^2 + 1}, quad x_1x_2 = frac{4m^2 - 4}{4k^2 + 1}. Since y_1y_2 = k^2x_1x_2 + km(x_1 + x_2) + m^2, the condition vec{k_{OM}} cdot vec{k_{ON}} = frac{5}{4} implies that frac{y_1y_2}{x_1x_2} = frac{5}{4}, quad text{i.e.,} quad 4y_1y_2 = 5x_1x_2. Thus, 4k^2x_1x_2 + 4km(x_1 + x_2) + 4m^2 = 5x_1x_2, which simplifies to m^2 + k^2 = frac{5}{4}. Given 0 leq m^2 < 4k^2 + 1 and m^2 + k^2 = frac{5}{4}, we have 0 leq m^2 < frac{6}{5} and frac{1}{20} < k^2 leq frac{5}{4}. The distance d from the origin O to line l is given by d = frac{|m|}{sqrt{1 + k^2}}. Thus, d^2 = frac{m^2}{1 + k^2} = frac{frac{5}{4} - k^2}{1 + k^2} = -1 + frac{9}{4(1 + k^2)}. Since frac{1}{20} < k^2 leq frac{5}{4}, we have 0 leq d^2 < frac{8}{7}, which leads to the range of distance d: boxed{d in left[0, frac{2sqrt{14}}{7}right)}."},{"prompt":"an election for class president, 61 votes are cast by students who are voting to choose one of four candidates.

Indeed, such paths have: - (n-4) right steps (since (n-2-2 = n-4)) - 2 up steps The total number of these paths is given by the binomial coefficient: [ binom{(n-4) + 2}{2} = binom{n-2}{2} ] 5. **Exclusion principle**: However, we need to exclude those paths that touch either of the forbidden lines (y = x) or (y = x - n + 2). Precisely, the problematic paths are: - A path passing through point ((2,2)) - A path passing through point ((n-2,0)) Thus, there are exactly 2 invalid paths to consider. 6. **Valid paths**: By excluding the invalid paths from the total paths, we get: [ text{Valid paths} = binom{n-2}{2} - 2 ] 7. **Simplifying the binomial expression**: Utilizing the binomial coefficient formula, we can simplify further: [ binom{n-2}{2} = frac{(n-2)(n-3)}{2} ] Thus: [ text{Valid paths} = frac{1}{2}(n-2)(n-3) - 2 ] 8. **Final simplification**: Continuing to simplify, we get: [ frac{1}{2}(n-2)(n-3) - 2 = frac{1}{2}(n^2 - 5n + 6) - 2 ] Combining like terms, we obtain: [ frac{1}{2}(n^2 - 5n + 6 - 4) = frac{1}{2}(n^2 - 5n + 2) ] # Conclusion: Hence, the number of ways to walk from ((0,0)) to ((n,2)) without violating the conditions is: [ boxed{frac{1}{2}left(n^2 - 5n + 2right)} ]"},{"prompt":"f all the abscissas of the points on the graph of the function y=cos x are halved (while the ordinates remain unchanged), and then the graph is shifted to the left by frac{π}{4} units, the corresponding function expression of the resulting graph is: A: y=cos (frac{x}{2}+frac{π}{4}) B: y=cos (2x+frac{π}{4}) C: y=cos (frac{x}{2}+frac{π}{8}) D: y=cos (2x+frac{π}{2})","completion":"To solve this problem, we'll take it step by step, focusing on the transformations applied to the function y=cos x. **Step 1: Halving the Abscissas** When the abscissas (x-coordinates) of all points on the graph of y=cos x are halved, the effect is to stretch the graph horizontally by a factor of 2. Mathematically, this is represented by replacing x with 2x in the function. This gives us the new function: [y = cos(2x)] **Step 2: Shifting Left by frac{pi}{4} Units** Shifting a graph to the left involves adding to the x-coordinate inside the function.

Note that (z_0) lies on the unit circle because (|z_0| = 1). - Consider the complex plane representation where (Z) corresponds to (z) and (Z_0) corresponds to (z_0). - Since (omega) maps inside the unit circle, the angle (angle OZ_0W < 90^circ), implying (angle ZZ_0W > 90^circ). Thus, we have: [ |ZW| > |Z_0W| implies left|z - omegaright| > left|z_0 - omegaright| ] The lemma is proven. 2. **Returning to the Original Problem Statement:** We now apply this lemma to the function (f(z)). - We first show that the roots of (f(z)) lie within the unit circle. The function (f(z) = z^2 - z + a) is a quadratic equation. We analyze roots based on the value of (a): 3. **Discussing the Roots:** (i) **For (0 < a leq frac{1}{4}):** [ Delta = 1 - 4a geq 0 ] - The roots (z_1) and (z_2) are real numbers: [ z_{1,2} = frac{1 pm sqrt{1 - 4a}}{2} ] - We observe that: [ max left{ |z_1|, |z_2| right} = frac{1 + sqrt{1 - 4a}}{2} < 1 ] Thus, both roots lie within the unit circle. (ii) **For (frac{1}{4} < a < 1):** [ Delta = 1 - 4a < 0 ] - In this case, the roots are a pair of complex conjugates: [ z_{1,2} = frac{1 pm i sqrt{4a - 1}}{2} ] - We find the magnitudes: [ |z_{1,2}| = sqrt{a} in (0, 1) ] Again, these roots lie within the unit circle. Combining both cases, we establish that the roots of (f(z)) indeed lie within the unit circle. 4. **Considering the Function (f(z)):** - Given (|f(z)| = |z - z_1||z - z_2|). - For (|z| = 1), let (z_0 = z). Then, this choice satisfies the condition automatically. - For (|z| > 1), by our lemma, take (z_0 = frac{z}{|z|}). Then: [ left|z_0 - z_1right| < left|z - z_1right| quad text{and} quad left|z_0 - z_2right| < left|z - z_2right| ] Therefore, [ left|f(z_0)right| = left|z_0 - z_1right|left|z_0 - z_2right| < left|z - z_1right|left|z - z_2right| = |f(z)| ] Thus, for any (z) with (|z| geq 1), there exists (z_0) with (|z_0| = 1) such that (left|f(z_0)right| leq left|f(z)right|).

The height from a vertex to the opposite face is perpendicular to that face. If the foot of the height lies outside the face, this means that we are dealing with an obtuse triangle (or obtuse dihedral angle). 3. **Investigate Dihedral Angles:** Let's consider the faces (triangle BCD), (triangle ACD), (triangle ABD), and the base (triangle ABC). - For the height from ( A ) to (triangle BCD) to lie outside (triangle BCD), the dihedral angle between faces (triangle ABD) and (triangle ACD) must be obtuse. - Similarly, for the height from ( B ) to (triangle ACD) to lie outside (triangle ACD), the dihedral angle between faces (triangle ABC) and (triangle BCD) must be obtuse. - Following this pattern for remaining heights, if all dihedral angles are considered, two opposite pairs of dihedral angles must be obtuse to satisfy that all heights fall outside their faces. 4. **Construction of such a Pyramid:** Construct a triangular pyramid where two pairs of opposite dihedral angles are obtuse. - For example, if (angle DBC) and (angle DCA) are obtuse, the corresponding feet of the heights from ( A ) to (triangle BCD) and from ( B ) to (triangle ACD) would lie outside the respective faces. - Similarly, if (angle DBA) and (angle DAC) are obtuse, the heights from ( C ) and ( D ) to their respective faces would fall outside. 5. **Existence Proof:** From the above construction reasoning, such a pyramid does exist when it possesses two pairs of opposite obtuse dihedral angles. The geometrical arrangement of the vertices should be such that these conditions are met. # Conclusion: Thus, there exists a triangular pyramid with the property that the feet of all heights lie outside their corresponding faces when the pyramid has two pairs of opposite obtuse dihedral angles.

The diagonal and midline reflections would reduce the independent squares to those in approximately one-eighth of the quadrant (due to overlap on lines of symmetry). - Counting these squares, we consider the upper triangle in one of these eighths, plus half the boundary line squares (not counting the center again), leading to a smaller number of independent choices. 3. **Combinatorial Counting**: - Let's say we calculate there are 6 independent squares based on the symmetry analysis. Each square can be either black or white, giving 2^6 = 64 combinations. - Subtract the 2 cases where all squares are the same color to meet the condition of at least one black and one white square.

Since the sines are in the ratio of 3:5:7, and knowing that the sine function reaches its maximum value of 1 at 90^circ but continues to be less than 1 for angles between 90^circ and 180^circ, we can deduce that the largest angle must be greater than 90^circ but less than 180^circ. Furthermore, since the sum of the angles in any triangle is 180^circ, and given the ratio of the sines (which indirectly gives us a hint about the proportion of the angles), the largest angle, which corresponds to the largest sine value, must be such that it allows the other two angles to contribute to the total sum of 180^circ without any of them being negative or unrealistically large.

Thus, k = 0. 2. **Internally Tangent Circles**: If one circle is inside the other and they are tangent at one point, there is exactly one line tangent to both circles at the point of tangency.

Let us start by considering the rhombus (ABCD) with the given points (E) and (F) being the midpoints of sides (AB) and (BC), respectively. The problem states that point (P) satisfies (PA = PF) and (PE = PC). 2. First, notice that the fact (PA = PF) implies that point (P) lies on the perpendicular bisector of segment (AF). Similarly, the condition (PE = PC) implies that (P) also lies on the perpendicular bisector of segment (EC). 3. Let us now find the intersection of these two perpendicular bisectors: - The perpendicular bisector of (AF) is the line that passes through the midpoint of (AF) and is perpendicular to (AF). - Similarly, the perpendicular bisector of (EC) is the line that passes through the midpoint of (EC) and is perpendicular to (EC). 4. Since (A) and (C) are opposite corners of the rhombus (ABCD), and (E) is the midpoint of (AB) while (F) is the midpoint of (BC), the segments (AF) and (EC) are both diagonally related within the rhombus. The perpendicular bisectors of these segments will intersect at the same midpoint. 5. Let (Q) be the point symmetric to (P) with respect to the diagonal (BD) of the rhombus. By construction: - (QA = QF), which is a property of the rhombus symmetry. - (QE = QC), which similarly holds due to the symmetrical properties. 6.

We need to cover an ( n times n ) grid with T-tetraminos without any overlaps. A T-tetramino consists of 4 grid cells arranged in a \\"T\\" shape. 2. **Condition for covering the grid**: Each T-tetramino covers exactly 4 cells. Hence, the total number of cells in the ( n times n ) grid, which is ( n^2 ), must be divisible by 4. This implies the necessary condition: [ 4 mid n^2 ] Since ( n^2 ) must be divisible by 4, ( n ) itself must be divisible by 2. 3. **Finer divisibility condition**: To see whether ( n ) needs to be a multiple of 4, let's consider tiling an ( n times n ) grid with T-tetraminos. If ( n ) is even but not a multiple of 4, it still might not be possible to cover the grid fully using T-tetraminos. This leads us to investigate further. 4. **Coloring the grid as a checkerboard**: Color the grid in a checkerboard pattern, where alternating cells are colored black and white. In this pattern, there will be an equal number of black and white cells. 5. **Types of T-tetraminos**: Observe that there are two possible configurations for a T-tetramino on the checkerboard: - One that covers three white cells and one black cell (Type 1) - One that covers three black cells and one white cell (Type 2) 6. **Equating the number of T-types**: We denote ( k ) as the number of Type 1 T-tetraminos. Because the grid is evenly split between black and white cells, for every Type 1 T-tetramino, there must be a corresponding Type 2 T-tetramino to maintain the balance. 7. **Total cell count requirement**: Each type of T-tetramino covers 4 cells. Since Type 1 covers three white and Type 2 covers three black, the only way to balance both black and white cells is to have: [ 3k + k = 4k quad text{(total white cells)} quad text{and} quad 3k + k = 4k quad text{(total black cells)} ] Thus, the total number of cells on the grid is: [ 4k + 4k = 8k ] This means ( 8k = n^2 ).

Since each packet weighs 16 pounds and 4 ounces, we need to convert the ounces to pounds to add it to the 16 pounds. Let's denote the number of ounces in one pound as x. So, 4 ounces is equivalent to 4/x pounds. The weight of one packet in pounds is therefore: 16 pounds + (4/x) pounds The total weight of the 2080 packets is: 2080 packets * (16 pounds + 4/x pounds) Now, we know that the total weight of the 2080 packets fills the 13-ton (or 33800-pound) gunny bag.

We know that the total number of chickens is 383, so: Quentin's chickens + Skylar's chickens + Colten's chickens = Total chickens Quentin's chickens + 107 + 37 = 383 Quentin's chickens + 144 = 383 Quentin's chickens = 383 - 144 Quentin's chickens = 239 Quentin has 239 chickens, which is 25 more than a certain multiple of the chickens that Skylar has. Let's call the multiple \\"m\\". So we have: 239 = m * 107 + 25 To find the multiple \\"m\\", we need to subtract 25 from Quentin's total and then divide by Skylar's total: m = (239 - 25) / 107 m = 214 / 107 m = 2 Therefore, the multiple of the number of chickens Skylar has that Quentin has 25 more than is boxed{2} ."},{"prompt":"A and B started a business jointly.

What is the ratio of A's investment to B's investment?","completion":"Let's denote A's investment as ( x ) times B's investment. So, if B invested ( I ), then A invested ( xI ). Also, let's denote the period of B's investment as ( T ). Therefore, A's investment period is ( 2T ). The profit share in a business is proportional to the product of the investment and the time period of the investment. So, A's share of the profit would be proportional to ( xI times 2T ) and B's share would be proportional to ( I times T ). The ratio of A's profit to B's profit is therefore ( frac{xI times 2T}{I times T} = 2x ). Given that B received Rs. 4000 as profit, we can denote A's profit as ( 2x times 4000 ) because A's profit is ( 2x ) times B's profit. The total profit is Rs. 28000, so we can write the equation: [ A's profit + B's profit = Total profit ] [ 2x times 4000 + 4000 = 28000 ] Solving for ( x ): [ 8000x + 4000 = 28000 ] [ 8000x = 28000 - 4000 ] [ 8000x = 24000 ] [ x = frac{24000}{8000} ] [ x = 3 ] So, A's investment is boxed{3} times B's investment.

For the second relationship, where seven bundles of high-quality grass, with the number of roots reduced by 25, are equal to the number of roots of five bundles of low-quality grass, we can write the equation as: [7x - 25 = 5y] Thus, the system of equations that correctly represents the relationships given in the problem is: [left{{begin{array}{l}{5x-11=7y}{7x-25=5y}end{array}}right.] Comparing this system of equations to the choices provided in the problem, we find that the correct answer is: [boxed{C}]"},{"prompt":"f Greg buys 6 shirts, some trousers, and 2 ties, the total cost is 80.

Then ( i + j = 1 ) (which is odd), and ( binom{n}{0} + binom{n}{1} = 1 + n ). Since ( n ) is odd, ( 1 + n ) is even. Thus, ( i + j ) and ( binom{n}{i} + binom{n}{j} ) do not have the same parity. Therefore, ( n ) must be even. 2. **Parity of Binomial Coefficients**: - For ( n ) to be even, we need to ensure that ( binom{n}{i} ) and ( binom{n}{j} ) have the same parity for all ( 0 leq i, j leq n ).

Thus, we have four sets: ( A_0, A_1, A_2, ) and ( A_3 ). 2. **Assume the Opposite:** Assume for the sake of contradiction that ( S ) is not balanced. This means there exists some ( a in S ) such that for every ( b in S ) with ( b neq a ), ( frac{a+b}{2} notin S ). 3. **Analyze Congruence Classes:** Without loss of generality, let ( a in A_1 ).

Since it is known that the length of the path should be even (referencing problem P0932), this scenario makes it impossible.

Formally, [ S_i = { n in mathbb{N} mid n equiv i-1 pmod{99} text{ and } n text{ is even} }. ] - For the 100-th subset, include all odd natural numbers.

Hence, adding (99b) to an even number results in an odd number, and adding (99b) to an odd number results in an even number. 3. **Case Analysis Based on Parity and Modulo Operation:** - **Case 1:** (a) and (c) are both odd: - If (a) and (c) are both odd, they belong to the subset (S_{100}). Hence, they satisfy the condition of being in the same subset. - **Case 2:** (a) and (c) are both even: - Since both are even, consider their congruences modulo 99: [ a equiv k pmod{99} quad text{and} quad c equiv k pmod{99}. ] Here, (k) is the remainder when both (a) and (c) are divided by 99. - Notice that being even with the same remainder modulo 99 would place (a) and (c) in the same subset (S_i) for some (i = k + 1). 4. **Ensuring All Conditions:** - In every possible scenario (either both numbers are odd or both are even with the same remainder when divided by 99), the two numbers (a) and (c) that satisfy (a + 99b = c) will always be part of the same subset constructed as above. 5. **Conclusion:** Therefore, we have shown there exists a partition of the set of all natural numbers into 100 non-empty subsets such that for any (a, b, c) satisfying (a + 99b = c), at least two of them belong to the same subset.

This implies that the bound is very tight, giving ( 2(k-1) ) connections to spare. 6. **Using the intersection property:** - Denote the stations in ( S ) as ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_k ). Each of these stations is on ( k-1 ) metro lines that go through ( S ), so each one has exactly one metro line that goes through it and does not go through ( S ), and all these lines are unique. Denote these lines by ( M_1, M_2, ldots, M_k ). 7. **Intersections of lines:** - Every two lines must intersect, and the intersections are always outside of ( S ). If they do not all intersect at the same station, we would get more than ( 2(k-1) ) spare connections, leading to a contradiction. 8. **Counting intersections:** - Every intersection has an odd number of lines, so there are no intersections of exactly two lines. An intersection of ( t ) lines gives ( t-1 ) spare connections. Therefore, if there are more than ( k-1 ) intersections, we have a contradiction. 9. **Maximal intersections:** - Let ( X ) and ( Y ) be the two maximal intersections with ( x ) and ( y ) lines, respectively. There is at most one line in both ( X ) and ( Y ), and any pair of lines (one from ( X ) and one from ( Y )) must be in a different intersection. Thus, there are at least ( (x-1)(y-1) ) intersections, and: [ (x-1)(y-1) le k-1 ] Since ( x-1 le frac{k-1}{2} ), we get that every other intersection has at most ( sqrt{k-1} ) lines. 10. **Summing intersections:** - Denote the number of lines in each intersection in descending order by ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_m ). We know that: [ sum_{i=1}^m (a_i - 1) le k-1 ] Therefore: [ sum_{i=1}^m a_i le 2k ] Since every pair of lines ( (M_i, M_j) ) must be in exactly one intersection, we have: [ sum_{i=1}^m binom{a_i}{2} = binom{k-1}{2} ] Using convexity, we get: [ binom{k-1}{2} = sum_{i=1}^m binom{a_i}{2} le binom{a_1}{2} + sqrt{2k} cdot binom{sqrt{2k}}{2} le binom{frac{k-1}{2}}{2} + sqrt{2k} cdot binom{sqrt{2k}}{2} ] This leads to a contradiction for large ( k ), and small ( k ) can be checked by hand.

The two inscribed rectangles that share a common vertex (K) on side (AB) will have (K) located somewhere on (AB). - Without loss of generality, let (K) be at ((x, 0)) where (0 leq x leq a). 3. Denote the two inscribed rectangles such that: - One rectangle has vertices (K, L_1, M, N_1), - The other rectangle has vertices (K, L_2, M, N_2). 4. Since the given condition states that both rectangles share a common diagonal (KL), the configuration makes it clear that (M) and (N) lie on side (BC) for these rectangles. - Let (M) be at ((a, y_1)) and (N) be at ((a, y_2)). 5. The centers of all three rectangles (the two inscribed rectangles and the larger rectangle (ABCD)) must coincide as stated in problem 1.7. Therefore, the diagonals of these inscribed rectangles are common through point (K). 6. Since the centers coincide and considering properties of diagonals in rectangles, - The lengths (BM) and (CN) (which are segments on (BC)) relate as follows: - (BM = y_1) and (NC = (b - y_2)). 7. The segment (M_1N_1) is a transversal through center (O) such that: - (BO_1 = CO_1), - (M_1O_1 = N_1O_1). 8. As a result, (BM = NC), so: - The lengths (y_1) and (b - y_2) must balance out. 9. To show mathematically that the sum of their areas equals the area of (ABCD): - The area of first inscribed rectangle (KLMN_1) is: [ S_{KLMN_1} = KB cdot BM ] - The area of second inscribed rectangle (KLMN_2) is: [ S_{KLMN_2} = LC cdot CN ] 10. Therefore, in order to prove the statement: - Consider the sum of areas of inscribed rectangles needing to add up to total area of (ABCD): [ S_{KLMN_1} + S_{KLMN_2} = S_{KLBC} ] - This can be expanded and combined in terms of the full area (ABCD) similarly: [ left( KB cdot BM + LC cdot CM right) + left( KB cdot BN + LC cdot CN right) = KB cdot BC + LC cdot BC ] 11. Summing the corresponding terms simplistically as: [ K(B cdot BC) + L(C cdot BC) = AB cdot BC ] # Conclusion: By demonstrating that the area summations of smaller inscribed rectangles' properties: [ KB cdot BM + LC cdot CN = AB cdot BC ] effectively meet at total area (ABCD): Hence, the sum of their areas equals the area of rectangle (ABCD): [ boxed{sum text{Inscribed Areas} = text{ Total Area}_text{(ABCD) }} ] Therefore, the final answer is boxed summation equality.

The farmer sells 5 chickens at 8 each, so that's 5 * 8 = 40. The farmer sells 2 ducks at 10 each, so that's 2 * 10 = 20. The total earnings from selling the chickens and ducks is 40 + 20 = 60.

Let's denote the multiple by which the person paid for the wheelbarrow as \\"x\\". So the equation for the transaction is: 30 * x = 30 + 60 Solving for x, we get: 30x = 90 x = 90 / 30 x = 3 So the person paid 3 times the amount the farmer originally paid for the wheelbarrow.

D = A/2 (since d is half the age of a) We also know that the sum of their ages is 33: A + B + C + D = 33 Now, let's express everything in terms of C: From 2, we have B = 2C, so A = B + 2 = 2C + 2.

Let ( H ) be the foot of the altitude from ( A ) to ( BC ), ( K ) be the point where the incircle touches ( BC ), and ( M ) be the midpoint of ( BC ). 2. According to the problem, ( H ) and ( M ) are symmetric with respect to ( K ). This implies that ( K ) is the midpoint of ( HM ). 3. Let ( r ) be the inradius of ( triangle ABC ). The incircle touches ( BC ) at ( K ), and the excircle touches ( BC ) at ( K' ). Let ( AK' ) intersect the incircle at point ( P ). Since ( KP ) is the diameter of the incircle, we have ( KP = 2r ). 4. Given that ( H ) and ( M ) are symmetric with respect to ( K ), the distance ( HK ) is equal to ( KM ). Since ( M ) is the midpoint of ( BC ), we have ( BM = MC = frac{BC}{2} ). 5. The altitude ( AH ) from ( A ) to ( BC ) can be expressed in terms of the inradius ( r ) and the area ( S ) of ( triangle ABC ). The area ( S ) can be calculated using the formula: [ S = frac{1}{2} times BC times AH ] 6. The area ( S ) can also be expressed in terms of the semiperimeter ( s ) and the inradius ( r ): [ S = s times r ] where ( s = frac{AB + BC + AC}{2} ). 7. Equating the two expressions for the area ( S ), we get: [ frac{1}{2} times BC times AH = s times r ] 8. Since ( AH = 3r ) (as given in the problem), we substitute ( AH = 3r ) into the equation: [ frac{1}{2} times BC times 3r = s times r ] 9. Simplifying the equation, we get: [ frac{3}{2} times BC times r = s times r ] 10. Dividing both sides by ( r ), we obtain: [ frac{3}{2} times BC = s ] 11. Solving for ( BC ), we get: [ BC = frac{2}{3} times s ] 12. Since ( s = frac{AB + BC + AC}{2} ), we substitute ( s ) into the equation: [ BC = frac{2}{3} times frac{AB + BC + AC}{2} ] 13.

The formula for the future value (FV) with simple interest is: FV = P + (P * r * t) / 100 Given that FV = 920 and t = 3 years, we can write the equation as: 920 = P + (P * r * 3) / 100 If the interest rate is increased by 3%, the new interest rate becomes (r + 3). The new future value with the increased interest rate is 992. So, we can write the second equation as: 992 = P + (P * (r + 3) * 3) / 100 Now we have two equations: 1) 920 = P + (P * r * 3) / 100 2) 992 = P + (P * (r + 3) * 3) / 100 Let's simplify both equations by multiplying through by 100 to eliminate the denominators: 1) 92000 = 100P + 3Pr 2) 99200 = 100P + 3P(r + 3) Now let's expand the second equation: 99200 = 100P + 3Pr + 9P Subtract the first equation from the second equation to eliminate P and find the value of r: 99200 - 92000 = (100P + 3Pr + 9P) - (100P + 3Pr) 7200 = 9P Now, divide both sides by 9 to find P: P = 7200 / 9 P = 800 So, the initial sum of money is boxed{800} ."},{"prompt":"Given sin alpha + cos alpha = frac{1}{5}, and frac{pi}{2} leqslant alpha leqslant frac{pi}{2}, then tan alpha equals to ( ).

We measure time in seconds. 1. **Calculate the probability of passing the first intersection with Ulitsa Uzkaya:** - The green light duration for Dolgoe highway on the first traffic light is x seconds. - The red light duration for Dolgoe highway (allowing passage on Ulitsa Uzkaya) is 30 seconds (half a minute). - The total cycle duration for the first traffic light is x + 30 seconds.

Trevor has 127 coins in total and he counted 39 quarters and 28 dimes. So, the number of nickels and pennies combined is: 127 (total coins) - 39 (quarters) - 28 (dimes) = 60 coins Now, we know that the ratio of nickels to pennies is 3:2. This means that for every 3 nickels, there are 2 pennies. To find out how many nickels and pennies there are, we need to divide the 60 coins into parts that maintain this ratio. The total number of parts in the ratio is 3 (nickels) + 2 (pennies) = 5 parts. Now, we can find the value of one part by dividing the total number of nickels and pennies by the total number of parts: 60 coins / 5 parts = 12 coins per part Since there are 3 parts for nickels, the number of nickels is: 3 parts * 12 coins per part = 36 nickels And since there are 2 parts for pennies, the number of pennies is: 2 parts * 12 coins per part = 24 pennies Now, let's find out how many more coins of nickels and pennies combined than quarters and dimes Trevor has: Nickels and pennies combined: 36 (nickels) + 24 (pennies) = 60 coins Quarters and dimes combined: 39 (quarters) + 28 (dimes) = 67 coins The difference is: 60 (nickels and pennies) - 67 (quarters and dimes) = -7 coins This means that Trevor actually has boxed{7} fewer coins of nickels and pennies combined than quarters and dimes, not more."},{"prompt":"Line a and line b are parallel, with 5 points on line a and 6 points on line b.

Use trigonometric identities to simplify the terms: [ cos (alpha + beta) = cos alpha cos beta - sin alpha sin beta ] Substitute in the equation: [ cos alpha + cos beta - (cos alpha cos beta - sin alpha sin beta) = frac{3}{2} ] Simplify: [ cos alpha + cos beta - cos alpha cos beta + sin alpha sin beta = frac{3}{2} ] 3.

Further breaking it down, we use the identity again: [ 4 cos^2 frac{alpha + beta}{2} - 4 cos frac{alpha + beta}{2} cos frac{alpha - beta}{2} + 1 = 0 ] Then we get: [ (2 cos frac{alpha + beta}{2} - cos frac{alpha - beta}{2} )^2 + sin^2 frac{alpha - beta}{2}= 0 ] 6.

Manipulate the equation: [ sin alpha sin beta + (1 - cos alpha) cos beta + cos alpha - frac{3}{2} = 0 ] 3.

Consider the altitude AA_1 from A to BC. By the definition of an orthic triangle, AA_1 is an altitude in both triangle ABC and triangle A_{1}B_{1}C_{1}. Therefore, AA_1 divides angle B_1A_1C_1 into two equal angles since it is also an angular bisector in triangle A_{1}B_{1}C_{1}. 3.

Factoring 180 = 2^2 cdot 3^2 cdot 5. There are several ways to distribute these factors into three groups (choosing which goes to a+1, b+1, and c+1). Possible distributions are: - (4, 9, 5), (20, 9, 1), (4, 45, 1), (36, 5, 1), (2, 18, 5), etc. Each set of counts must be assigned to a slot of a+1, b+1, or c+1, and can be in any order.

[*]She does not have an energy cap. In particular, her energy may go above 100 if, for instance, she chooses to rest during the first minute.[/list]</details>","completion":"1. **Initial Setup**: Applejack starts with 100 energy. She has 60 minutes to either buck trees or rest. Each minute, she can either: - Buck n trees and lose 1 energy, where n is her current energy. - Rest and gain 1 energy. 2. **Resting Strategy**: If Applejack rests for the first x minutes, her energy will increase by x units. Therefore, after x minutes of resting, her energy will be 100 + x. 3. **Bucking Strategy**: For the remaining 60 - x minutes, she will buck trees. Each minute, she will buck a number of trees equal to her current energy and then lose 1 energy. 4. **Energy Calculation**: - At the start of the (x+1)-th minute, her energy is 100 + x. - At the start of the (x+2)-th minute, her energy is 100 + x - 1. - This pattern continues until the 60-th minute. 5. **Total Trees Calculation**: The total number of trees bucked from minute x+1 to minute 60 can be calculated as the sum of an arithmetic series: [ text{Total trees} = (100 + x) + (99 + x) + (98 + x) + ldots + (100 + x - (60 - x - 1)) ] Simplifying the last term: [ 100 + x - (60 - x - 1) = 100 + x - 60 + x + 1 = 41 + 2x ] Therefore, the series is: [ (100 + x) + (99 + x) + ldots + (41 + 2x) ] 6. **Sum of Arithmetic Series**: The sum of the arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic series: [ S = frac{n}{2} left( a + l right) ] where n is the number of terms, a is the first term, and l is the last term. - Here, n = 60 - x - a = 100 + x - l = 41 + 2x Substituting these values: [ S = frac{60 - x}{2} left( (100 + x) + (41 + 2x) right) ] Simplifying inside the parentheses: [ S = frac{60 - x}{2} left( 141 + 3x right) ] Therefore: [ S = frac{(60 - x)(141 + 3x)}{2} ] 7. **Maximizing the Sum**: To find the maximum number of trees bucked, we need to maximize the expression: [ frac{(60 - x)(141 + 3x)}{2} ] This is a quadratic expression in x. To find the maximum, we can take the derivative with respect to x and set it to zero: [ frac{d}{dx} left( frac{(60 - x)(141 + 3x)}{2} right) = 0 ] Simplifying the derivative: [ frac{d}{dx} left( (60 - x)(141 + 3x) right) = 0 ] [ frac{d}{dx} left( 8460 + 180x - 141x - 3x^2 right) = 0 ] [ 180 - 141 - 6x = 0 ] [ 39 - 6x = 0 ] [ x = frac{39}{6} = 6.5 ] 8. **Evaluating at Integer Values**: Since x must be an integer, we evaluate the expression at x = 6 and x = 7: - For x = 6: [ S = frac{(60 - 6)(141 + 3 cdot 6)}{2} = frac{54 cdot 159}{2} = 4293 ] - For x = 7: [ S = frac{(60 - 7)(141 + 3 cdot 7)}{2} = frac{53 cdot 162}{2} = 4293 ] Both values yield the same result.

First, we identify the perfect squares around 51 to estimate sqrt{51}: [ 49 < 51 < 64 ] which implies [ 7 < sqrt{51} < 8 ] because taking the square root of each part of the inequality gives us the range of sqrt{51}. 2. From the inequality 7 < sqrt{51} < 8, it's clear that the integer part of sqrt{51} is 7. So, we have: [ boxed{7} ] 3. To find the decimal part of 9-sqrt{51}, we first express 9-sqrt{51} in terms of an inequality: [ -8 < -sqrt{51} < -7 ] Adding 9 to each part of the inequality gives: [ 1 < 9-sqrt{51} < 2 ] This means the value of 9-sqrt{51} is between 1 and 2, so its integer part is 1. 4.

Since the train and the man are moving in opposite directions, their speeds add up when calculating the relative speed. The train's speed is given as 65.99424046076315 kmph. We need to convert this speed into meters per second (m/s) to be consistent with the other measurements given in the problem. We use the conversion factor that 1 kmph is equal to 5/18 m/s. So, the train's speed in m/s is: 65.99424046076315 kmph * (5/18) m/s per kmph = 18.33117790687865 m/s The train passes the man in 6 seconds, and the length of the train is 120 meters. Therefore, the relative speed at which the train passes the man is the distance divided by the time: Relative speed = Distance / Time Relative speed = 120 meters / 6 seconds = 20 m/s Now, we have the relative speed (20 m/s) and the train's speed (18.33117790687865 m/s).

Now, we need to find out how many drops have dripped into the pot in 50 minutes. Since the leak drips at a rate of 3 drops per minute, we can calculate the total number of drops by multiplying the number of drops per minute by the number of minutes: Total drops = 3 drops/minute * 50 minutes = 150 drops Now that we know the total volume of water (3000 ml) and the total number of drops (150 drops), we can calculate the volume of each drop by dividing the total volume by the total number of drops: Volume of each drop = Total volume / Total drops Volume of each drop = 3000 ml / 150 drops Volume of each drop = 20 ml/drop Therefore, the volume of each drop is boxed{20} milliliters."},{"prompt":"A sixdigit number starts with the digit one.

We are given that the front tires last for 21,000 km and the rear tires last for 28,000 km if left in their initial positions. We will determine the point at which the tires should be swapped to maximize the distance traveled. 1. **Initial Assumptions and Swappings:** Let's denote the variables as follows: - ( D_F = 21,000 ) km (duration for front tires) - ( D_R = 28,000 ) km (duration for rear tires) - ( x ) km is the distance traveled before swapping the tires. 2. **Wear of Tires Before Swapping:** Before swapping, each front tire and each rear tire will have worn down as follows: - Front tires: ( x ) km each - Rear tires: ( x ) km each 3. **Wear of Tires After Swapping:** When the tires are swapped at ( x ) km: - The front tires (initially) will have already worn ( x ) km and will be moved to the rear. - The rear tires (initially) will have already worn ( x ) km and will be moved to the front. Let ( y ) km be the additional distance traveled after the swap. Therefore: - Total distance traveled is ( x + y ) km. - Wear on new front tires (initially rear) after swap is ( x + y ). - Wear on new rear tires (initially front) after swap is ( x + y ). 4. **Conditions for Tire Wear:** Since the wear on each tire must be within its maximum allowable distance: - Front tires (initially front + moved to rear): ( x + y leq 21,000 ) km - Rear tires (initially rear + moved to front): ( x + y leq 28,000 ) km These conditions must hold for the tires to be completely utilized without exceeding their wear limit. 5. **Swapping Point**: To find ( x ) and ( y ) that maximizes ( x + y ): - Initially, after ( x ) km, let: - The front tires have ( 21,000 - x ) km tread remaining. - The rear tires have ( 28,000 - x ) km tread remaining. Assume the tires are swapped when the front tires tread is halfway: - ( x = frac{21,000}{2} = 10,500 ) km. 6. **Total Distance Calculation:** Post swapping, the remaining distance ( y ): - For front (formerly rear) tires: ( 21,000 - x = 21,000 - 10,500 = 10,500 ) km. - For rear (formerly front) tires: ( 28,000 - x = 28,000 - 10,500 = 17,500 ) km.

Let’s denote the halves of the two remaining dominoes as {a_1, a_2} and {b_1, b_2}, which means that we end up with four halves {a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2}. We aim to prove that among these four halves, there are at least two halves that are identical (i.e., they have the same value). 1. **Analysis of Possible Pairs:** Assume for contradiction that all four halves {a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2} are distinct. For simplicity, assume that these values are {0, 1, 2, 3}. 2. **Counting End Values in the Ordered Row:** Since 26 domino tiles are in a row, consider the following: - The tiles in a domino set cover values from 0 to 6. - Each value appears exactly 7 times among these tiles (since each pair is included in one of these dominoes and each domino covers two values). 3. **Determining Edge Scenarios:** In a domino chain, each internal value will match pairs with adjacent values. Because values match in pairs, for each number (0 through 6) used in the 26 dominoes laid end to end (thus 2 times 26 = 52 ends): 4. **Odd Number Occurrences Contradiction:** - If all the four halves are different, say {0, 1, 2, 3}: - We need seven 0s, seven 1s, seven 2s, and seven 3s. - Since each number appears in pairs within the chain, one end of the row must be unmatched (an odd occurrence). We need two ends of the chain (first and the last tile) to have appropriate pairs. So, if all four halves {a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2} were distinct (0, 1, 2, 3): - The total count requires at least one domino to make pairs and allow exactly two unpaired values at both ends. However, having four distinct numbers like {0, 1, 2, 3} resulted in a count scenario that conflicts. # Conclusion: Based upon this analysis, it’s impossible to have vivid non-identical splits of halves of dominoes {a_1, a_2, b_1, b_2} from four different numbers {0, 1, 2, 3} without contradiction of pair matching conditions which realizes as impossible as illustrated. Therefore, two pairs are logically winning out- same numerical cuts within reasoning. Hence, there must be at least one pair within half values that are indeed the same. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"the city of Novatown, the sales tax rate is 8%.

We aim to find a necessary and sufficient condition for a sphere to be circumscribed around this truncated pyramid. 2. **Necessary Condition:** If a sphere can be circumscribed around a truncated pyramid, each of the lateral trapezoidal faces cuts a circle from the sphere. A circumscribable trapezoid is known to be isosceles. Thus, the legs (non-parallel sides) of each trapezoid must be equal in length. 3. **Equal Side Lengths of Lateral Faces:** Given that the truncated pyramid's lateral edges are equal (i.e., the non-parallel sides of all trapezoids are of equal lengths), we establish that: [ text{The legs of one trapezoid } = text{The legs of the adjacent trapezoids} ] 4. **Conclusion for Necessary Condition:** The condition that the lateral edges of the truncated pyramid are equal is necessary for circumscribing a sphere. 5. **Sufficient Condition:** We show that this condition is also sufficient. When the lateral edges of the truncated pyramid are equal, the full pyramid from which the truncated pyramid is derived also has equal lateral edges, implying it is an isosceles pyramid. This means: [ text{The dihedral angles between the lateral faces and the base are equal} ] The center of the sphere circumscribed around the truncated pyramid lies equidistant from all six vertices. 6. **Angle and Intersection Analysis:** Considering the base triangles of the truncated pyramid (A_1B_1C_1) and (A_2B_2C_2), the centers of the circumscribed circles of these triangles are (O_1) and (O_2), respectively.

We do not need to stipulate separately that the base (n)-gon is circumscribable by a circle, because this follows if the pyramid's lateral edges are equal and subtend equal angles with the base. **Conclusion:** The necessary and sufficient condition to circumscribe a sphere around a truncated pyramid is that the lateral edges of the truncated pyramid are equal in length.

The key is to understand how information propagates through a network of people who know each other. 1. **Define the Problem and Terms:** - We have a village with 1000 inhabitants. - Each inhabitant knows every other inhabitant at most through some chain of acquaintances. - We need to show that informing just 90 specific inhabitants ensures that everyone in the village knows the news within 10 days. 2. **Properties of the Chain of Acquaintances:** - If an inhabitant X knows A_1, and A_1 knows A_2, continuing in this manner until A_k knows Y, we can describe this connection as a chain: X - A_1 - A_2 - cdots - A_k - Y. - From the problem, each pair of inhabitants is connected by such a chain due to the nature of their relationships. 3. **Understanding the Absence of Closed Chains:** - Suppose there exists a closed chain (i.e., a loop) such that X and Y are directly acquainted. However, from the problem constraints, no closed chains exist implying if X and Y are part of the same chain, they are not direct acquaintances. 4. **Analyzing Chain Lengths:** - Consider the longest chain where k is the number of intermediaries: [ X - A_1 - A_2 - cdots - A_{10} - cdots - A_k - Y ] - If ( k leq 19 ), then the length of the chain involving any person connecting to A_{10} is at most 10.

For this longest chain, anyone in the first group connected to A_{10} has a relationship not exceeding 11 people. 6. **Recursive Process for Informing All Inhabitants:** - By recursively informing a central person in each subgroup, within steps of 10 days, the news will spread: - Each subset follows the condition where the distance is less than or equal to 10 days from A_{10}. 7. **Bounding the Number of Steps:** - The news will cover each subset within 10 days and each recursive step ensures further subgroup news propagation. - Repeating this process ensures that, at most, after dividing ( 89 ) times (since ( 1000 div 11 < 90 )), we need to check the remaining 21 inhabitants. 8. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, selecting an initial set of 90 inhabitants ensures that within 10 days, news can propagate to every villager ensuring completeness due to minimal subgroup sizes. The conclusion is that to ensure all 1000 inhabitants know the news within 10 days, at most, select 90 inhabitants initially to spread the news.

Given that the smallest number of cubes is 30, we can set up an equation to find the volume of the box and then find the length of the box. Let's denote the side length of the cube as ( s ). The volume of the box is the product of its dimensions (length ( L ), width ( W ), and depth ( D )): [ text{Volume of the box} = L times W times D ] The volume of one cube is: [ text{Volume of one cube} = s^3 ] Since 30 cubes fill the box entirely, the volume of the box is also: [ text{Volume of the box} = 30 times s^3 ] We know the width ( W = 40 ) inches and the depth ( D = 16 ) inches.

The largest common divisor of 40 and 16 is 8 (since ( 40 = 5 times 8 ) and ( 16 = 2 times 8 )). So, the side length of the cube ( s = 8 ) inches.

On Monday, she bought three times the number of pints she bought on Sunday, so she bought 3S pints. On Tuesday, she bought one-third of the number of pints she bought on Monday, which is (1/3) * 3S = S pints. On Wednesday, she returned half of the pints she bought on Tuesday, which is (1/2) * S = S/2 pints. Now, we know that after returning the expired pints on Wednesday, she had 18 pints left. This means that before returning the expired pints, she had 18 + S/2 pints. The total number of pints she had before returning the expired ones on Wednesday is the sum of the pints she bought on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, which is S + 3S + S = 5S.

The probability of selecting a non-defective pen from the box is the number of non-defective pens divided by the total number of pens. There are 16 pens in total and 3 are defective, so there are 16 - 3 = 13 non-defective pens. The probability of selecting one non-defective pen is therefore 13/16. If the customer selects n pens, the probability that all n pens are non-defective is the product of the probabilities of selecting each non-defective pen one after the other without replacement. The probability of selecting the first non-defective pen is 13/16. After selecting one pen, there are now 15 pens left in the box, and assuming the first pen was non-defective, there are now 12 non-defective pens left. So the probability of selecting a second non-defective pen is 12/15. Continuing this pattern, the probability of selecting n non-defective pens in a row is: (13/16) * (12/15) * (11/14) * ... * ((13 - n + 1)/(16 - n + 1)) We are given that this probability is 0.65. We need to find the value of n that makes this equation true. Let's calculate the probabilities for different values of n: For n = 1: P(1 non-defective pen) = 13/16 = 0.8125 (which is greater than 0.65, so the customer buys more than 1 pen) For n = 2: P(2 non-defective pens) = (13/16) * (12/15) = 0.65 So, the customer buys 2 pens, as this is the scenario where the probability of neither pen being defective is boxed{0.65} ."},{"prompt":"The motion equation of an object is s=1t+t^2, where s is in meters, and t is in seconds.

Since James planted 15% more than his friends, he planted F + 0.15F flowers. The total number of flowers planted by James and his friends is the sum of the flowers planted by his friends and the flowers planted by James. Since James has 6 friends, the total number of flowers planted by his friends is 6F. Adding the flowers planted by James, the total becomes 6F + (F + 0.15F). We know that the total number of flowers planted in 2 days is 315, so we can set up the equation: 6F + (F + 0.15F) = 315 Combining like terms, we get: 6F + F + 0.15F = 315 7F + 0.15F = 315 7.15F = 315 Now, we can solve for F: F = 315 / 7.15 F = 44 Each of James' friends planted 44 flowers in 2 days.

Analyzing the conditions: - Binary numbers ending in (0001, 0011, 0100, 0101, 0111) will satisfy (M(i) = M(i + 7)). - There are 5 possible endings per 16 binary numbers.

If f(1)=2, then f(2017) equals ______.","completion":"According to the problem, since f(x) is an odd function defined on mathbb{R}, we have f(-x)=-f(x). Furthermore, since f(x+1) is an even function, we have f(-x+1)=f(x+1), which implies f(-x)=f(2+x). Combining these, we get: f(x+2)=-f(x). Then, f(x+4)=f[(x+2)+2]=-f(x+2)=f(x), which means the function has a period of 4. Therefore, f(2017)=f(1+4times504)=f(1)=-f(-1)=-2. So, f(2017)=-2. Hence, the answer is: boxed{-2}. Based on the problem, by analyzing the odd and even properties of the function and the fact that f(x+1) is an even function, we can deduce f(x+2)=-f(x), and further deduce f(x+4)=f(x). By analyzing the periodicity of the function, we can conclude that f(x) is a periodic function with a period of 4, and further analysis leads to f(2017)=f(1+4times504)=f(1)=-f(-1), which gives us the answer.

Let's also denote the period of B's investment as ( t ) and the period of A's investment as ( 2t ). The profit share of a partner in a partnership is proportional to the product of the investment and the time period for which the investment was made. So, A's share of the profit would be proportional to ( kx times 2t ) and B's share of the profit would be proportional to ( x times t ). The ratio of A's profit share to B's profit share is therefore: [ frac{A's , profit}{B's , profit} = frac{kx times 2t}{x times t} = frac{2kx}{x} = 2k ] Given that B received Rs 7000 as profit and the total profit is Rs 49000, A's profit would be Rs 49000 - Rs 7000 = Rs 42000. So, we have: [ frac{A's , profit}{B's , profit} = frac{42000}{7000} = 6 ] We already established that the ratio of A's profit to B's profit is ( 2k ), so: [ 2k = 6 ] Solving for ( k ), we get: [ k = frac{6}{2} = 3 ] Therefore, the ratio of A's investment to B's investment is ( boxed{3:1} )."},{"prompt":"Show that the five roots of the quintic ( a_5 x^5 + a_4 x^4 + a_3 x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_1 x + a_0 = 0 ) are not all real if ( 2a_4^2 < 5a_5a_3 ).","completion":"1. **Step 1: Define the roots and the polynomial** Let the roots of the given quintic polynomial [ a_5x^5 + a_4x^4 + a_3x^3 + a_2x^2 + a_1x + a_0 = 0 ] be denoted by ( r_1, r_2, r_3, r_4, r_5 ). 2. **Step 2: Formulate the condition involving (a_4^2) and (a_5a_3)** We are given the condition: [ 2a_4^2 < 5a_5a_3 ] 3. **Step 3: Express the polynomial's symmetric sums in terms of roots** By Vieta's formulas, we know that: [ a_5 sum_{i=1}^{5} r_i = -a_4 ] [ a_5 sum_{1 leq i < j leq 5} r_i r_j = a_3 ] 4. **Step 4: Substitute these into the inequality** Substituting the above into the given condition: [ 2 left( -frac{a_4}{a_5} right)^2 < 5 left( frac{a_3}{a_5} right) ] Simplifying: [ 2 frac{a_4^2}{a_5^2} < 5 frac{a_3}{a_5} ] Multiplying both sides by ( a_5^2 ): [ 2a_4^2 < 5a_5a_3 ] 5. **Step 5: Address polynomial's condition in terms of sum of squares and products** Expanding the square of sums and using the given inequality, we have: [ 2 sum_{i=1}^{5} r_i^2 + 4 sum_{1 leq i < j leq 5} r_i r_j < 5 sum_{1 leq i < j leq 5} r_i r_j ] Simplifying: [ 2 sum_{i=1}^{5} r_i^2 < sum_{1 leq i < j leq 5} r_i r_j ] 6. **Step 6: Use properties of real roots** If all (r_i) are real, the inequality must hold for non-negative sum of squares and sums.

in Dart involves the process of adapting or modifying your application to support different languages and cultures. This ensures that your application can be used by people from different regions, who speak different languages and have different cultural backgrounds. Dart provides the \`intl\` package, which is a powerful library for formatting and parsing dates, times, numbers, currencies and messages in various locales. It allows you to define messages in different languages and switch language dynamically at runtime. Here is a step-by-step guide to implement i18n in your Dart application: 1. Install the intl package by adding it to your pubspec.yaml file: \`\`\` dependencies: intl: ^0.17.0 \`\`\` 2. Create a directory named \\"l10n\\" (short for localization) at the root level of your project. Inside this directory, create a file named \\"intl_messages.arb\\". This file will contain all your messages in their default language. \`\`\` { \\"@@locale\\": \\"en\\", // default locale \\"hello\\": \\"Hello, world!\\", \\"greeting\\": \\"Welcome {name}!\\", \\"app_name\\": \\"My Awesome App\\", \\"title\\": \\"{appName} - Home\\", ... } \`\`\` In the above example, \`hello\`, \`greeting\`, \`app_name\`, \`title\` are message keys and their corresponding values are the default messages in English. 3. Add more files to the \\"l10n\\" directory for other languages you wish to support. The file names should be in the format \`intl_messages_<locale>.arb\`, where \`locale\` is the ISO language code for the language. For example, for French, the file name would be \`intl_messages_fr.arb\`. \`\`\` { \\"@@locale\\": \\"fr\\", // French locale \\"hello\\": \\"Bonjour, le monde!\\", \\"greeting\\": \\"Bienvenue {name}!\\", \\"app_name\\": \\"Mon application géniale\\", \\"title\\": \\"{appName} - Accueil\\", ... } \`\`\` In the above example, \`hello\` and \`greeting\` messages are defined in French. 4. Generate Dart code from the ARB files by running this command in your terminal: \`\`\` flutter pub run intl_translation:generate_from_arb --output-dir=lib/l10n lib/l10n/intl_messages.arb lib/l10n/intl_messages_*.arb \`\`\` This will generate a \`messages.dart\` file in the \`lib/l10n\` directory, which contains code that maps the message keys to their translated messages. 5. Use the \`Intl\` class and its methods to format messages, numbers, dates, and currencies based on the user's locale. For example, to format a date in the user's locale, you can use: \`\`\` import 'package:intl/intl.dart'; ... Text(DateFormat.yMd().format(DateTime.now())) \`\`\` 6. To switch language at runtime, use the \`Intl.defaultLocale\` property to set the user's preferred locale. For example, to switch to French: \`\`\` import 'package:intl/intl.dart'; ... Intl.defaultLocale = 'fr'; \`\`\` 7. Wrap your app with an \`Intl\` widget to rebuild the UI when the locale changes: \`\`\` return MaterialApp( localizationsDelegates: [ AppLocalizations.delegate, GlobalMaterialLocalizations.delegate, GlobalWidgetsLocalizations.delegate, ], supportedLocales: AppLocalizations.supportedLocales, home: MyHomePage(), ); \`\`\` In the above example, \`AppLocalizations\` is a class generated by the \`intl\` package that provides access to the translated messages. That's it! Your app now supports internationalization and can be used by people from different cultures and languages."},{"prompt":"Cons of i18n","completion":"While internationalization (i18n) can bring many benefits to your Dart application, there are also some potential cons to consider: 1. Increased development time: Implementing i18n requires additional work and resources to create and translate messages for different languages. This can lead to longer development times, particularly if you have a large application or need to support many languages. 2. Maintenance costs: Once you have implemented i18n in your application, you need to maintain it. This means updating messages, adding support for new languages, and testing for any localization issues. This can increase the overall cost of your application's development and maintenance. 3. Complexity: As your application grows, managing translations and i18n files can become more complex. This can lead to confusion and errors, particularly if you are managing translations for many languages. 4. String concatenation: When designing your application, it's important to keep in mind that i18n requires dynamic string concatenation. This can lead to less efficient or more difficult to maintain code. 5. Data privacy: When translating messages, you need to be careful with personal or sensitive data. Sensitive user data, like names, addresses, and phone numbers, should not be translated and shared with third-party translation services. Overall, while i18n can bring many benefits to your Dart application, it's important to weigh the potential cons and carefully plan and manage your translations to ensure the best possible user experience for your global audience."},{"prompt":"Hello, can you write an alternate ending for the The Powerpuff Girls episode “Imaginary Fiend” where the girls must stop Patches, an evil imaginary friend created by Mike, the new kid at Pokey Oaks Kindergarten.

Предложить технические и организационные решения, наилучшим образом учитывающие интересы разных подразделений и специалистов (стейкхолдеров) Заказчика Протоколы интервью: Васильев Николай Вы - Какие главные проблемы по-вашему требуют немедленного решения? Николай - да, таких проблем много! мы регулярно сталкиваемся с тем, что внутри сети проникает вредоносное ПО. Год назад поймали шифровальщик - он зашифровал практически всю инфу на серверах и рабочих станциях. Самое обидное - даже непонятно как он попал к нам! Другая проблема - все могут выходить в интернет без контроля. Так сложилось и бороться крайне тяжело. Люди посещают разные плохие ресурсы и мы можем с этим бороться только с помощью мониторинга активности пользователей через DLP и \\"давая по рукам\\" нарушителям. Это отнимает у нас кучу времени и мы и 10% пользователей не проверяем.Еще - в любой проблеме совершенно невозможно установить причину и виновника. При авариях айтишники кивают на пользователей, пользователи - на айтишников, а они вместе - на нас.В целом - мы очень плохо знаем что вообще происходит. Вот недавно заметил - в офисе клиент подключается к сети Wi-Fi чтобы посмотреть ютуб, пока менеджер оформляет бумаги - и он имеет доступ к нашей сети! Обсудил с айтишниками ситуацию - они сделали как им удобнее. Сказали - если вам нужно сделать иначе - скажите нам как. Вы - понятно. А есть какие-то параллельные проекты в области ИБ? Николай - на конференции по информационной безопасности я познакомился с ребятами из коммерческого SOС. Познакомился с командой, обсудили можем ли подключиться к их сервису. Но для того, чтобы они выполняли мониторинг, нужна базовая инфраструктура. В текущем состоянии мы не можем обеспечить для них поток событий для мониторинга. Хайдаров Фанис Вы - Фанис, а о каких особенностях идет речь? Фанис - Оборудование старое! давно не покупалось ничего нового, вот оно сыплется. И сеть и серверы. Сеть тормозит - оборудование устарело. Потихоньку исправляем - подрядчик делает СКС, думаем о замене сетевого оборудования, но там все не так просто Вы - а что именно не просто? Фанис - у нас стоят старые циски, еще длинки эти, которые вообще неуправляемые - если зависнут, приходится к ним ходить, искать...а что сейчас можно купить? Импортозамещение, циску не купить, с тем что есть на рынке мы не знакомы. Вы - понятно. Мы готовы помочь, поделиться компетенциями Фанис - да, было бы круто. у нас тут ядро сети старое, случись что - а все распадется и менять не на что. Вот и боимся даже перезагружать. Серверы тоже довольно старые, новый софт зачастую даже не тянут Вы - а виртуализация есть? Фанис - нет, у нас все старое, много лет не выделяли денег на модернизацию. Но сейчас решили двигаться в этом направлении. Есть пилотный проект по переносу ресурсов в публичное облако - за проект отвечает Архипова Ольга. Мы решили не инвестировать в серверы, а арендовать виртуальные машины и доступ к софту в одном дата центре в Москве. От нас требуют бесперебойной работы сервисов и SLA, но чтобы сделать это - нужно вложить много денег в оборудование и модернизацию серверной, закупку ИБП, дизель генераторов...В общем решили попробовать облако Вы - и как идет пилот? Фанис - вроде неплохо. Но когда Ольга в рабочее время переносит базы данных в облако, у нас канал Интернет ложится на несколько часов. Пользователи ругаются, почта не ходит, общем ужас и безобразие. В филиалы и точки продаж мы собственный интернет провели - чтобы не гоняли трафик через нас Вы - а зачем пользователи интернет используют? Фанис - да я откуда знаю? трафик ходит, каналы тормозят, нас ругают. Вот и весь разговор Вы - сочувствую, Фанис. А как у вас сегментация устроена? Фанис - да, она сложилась исторически. есть пользователи, они в нескольких сетях. Есть большая сеть для серверов с маской /22. Мы туда же закинули сети производственников, чтобы не настраивать маршрутизацию - там подрядчик который налаживал АСУ ТП так попросил, сказал так проще. Ну раз проще - мы сделали так Вы - а можете припомнить проблемы с ИТ? Фанис - да, вот неделю назад все на ушах стояли. Подрядчик менял СКС, отключал старые кабели, подключал новые. и сделал кольцо случайно. Сразу все легло. Пока бегали - искали, прошло много времени. ничего не работало, включая производство. Влетело всем, включая нас и подрядчика. А подрядчик говорит что нет маркировок на кабелях, поэтому ошибиться - проще простого. В общем, все старое. Вы - а у вас неуправляемые коммутаторы? Фанис - да всякие есть. Есть и длинки и циски, но циски у нас часто не настроены, а просто подключены и работают. На ядре настроены VLAN и маршрутизация. Все просто. Вот скоро новых сотрудников принимать будут в офис, нужно будет думать как сеть расширять и какие коммутаторы покупать Вы - Фанис, Вы сказали что проблемы с сетью долго диагностируются. А у вас есть мониторинг? Фанис - нет, мониторинга нет, для этого нужен сервер, настраивать Заббикс...нужны и время и деньги. Нам тут и так приходится выкручиваться. Вот смотрите что придумали! купил 4-ю малинку (Raspberry PI4), воткнули в сеть, туда в USB вставили модем. Поставили линукс, и теперь если ночью или в выходной что-то ломается, подключаюсь из дома работаю, исправляю! в противном случае придется ехать, некоторые техпроцессы круглосуточные. Вы - Фанис, а процесс подключения к сети как-то контролируется? мне говорили что у вас Wi-Fi в офисе имеет доступ во внутреннюю сеть... Фанис - а зачем это? ну допустим подключился к сети. У нас все машины под паролями, большинство компов в домене. что может пойти не так? Архипова Ольга Вы - отлично! А какие услуги вы заказали? Ольга - мы арендовали виртуальные машины - IAAS, где реализовали реплику нашего корпоративного приложения учета продукции. Мы изменили приложение, установив его на новую платформу, взамен устаревшей - все же наши серверы на предприятии мы давно не модернизировали. Сейчас мы отлаживаем данное приложение. Еще один эксперимент - мы решили попробовать облачную CRM в модели SAAS. Пока данной CRM пользуются филиалы. Вы - Ольга, а были какие-то проблемы при использовании облака? Ольга - Мы планируем попробовать уйти от монолитной реализации веб-сервиса приложения и перейти к микросервисной архитектуре и контейнерам. Облачный провайдер предложил нам опциональный балансировщик нагрузки для масштабирования сервисов. Это предлагается по привлекательным ценам. ну и технические проблемы - мы мигрировали базы данных сервиса по каналу Интернет и это заняло много времени и повредило работе предприятия - канал был перегружен. С этим нужно что-то делать. При этом ,мы запрашивали у провайдера расширение канала и даже оплачивали это. Но это не привело к существенному улучшению - Фанис не может понять, из-за того что роутер не вытягивает или пользователи более активно что-то качают. Вы - спасибо! Поможем разобраться что делать с этим. Других активностей по облачным технологиям нет? Ольга - сейчас мы переносим сервис кадрового документооборота, где хранятся данные о наших работниках. Мы бы хотели, чтобы сотрудники кадрового отдела могли получать доступ к ним из дома. Часто бывает, что сотрудники отдела кадров на больничном и вне офиса, а задачи нужно срочно делать. Так кадровики смогут быстрее обрабатывать задачи и эффективно работать из дома. прямо сейчас мы переносим базу данных приложения в облако. Вы - Ольга, а Вы переносите \\"боевую\\" базу в облако, содержащую весь объем данных? Ольга - да, конечно. Это позволит нам более наглядно и релевантно провести пилотирование облака. Вы - Ольга, а Вы предусматриваете средства защиты информации для облачных сервисов? Ольга - облачный провайдер позиционирует себя как \\"самый безопасный на рынке облачных услуг\\". полагаю, что они используют что-то. В любом случае, как говорил Фанис, пароли на серверах надежные и учетные записи блокируются при попытке перебора. Полагаю, этого достаточно Вы - Ольга, спасибо большое за информацию! Фирсов Эльдар Эльдар - рад это слышать. Давайте подумаем с учетом требований импортозамещения. Я недавно был на семинаре Элтекс - мне понравилось их оборудование. Вы - Да, Элтекс выглядит хорошим решением, мы проработаем с нашими сетевыми архитекторами этот вопрос. А что вы можете сказать про состояние систем информационной безопасности? Эльдар - да, меня очень волнует стык с технологической сетью производства (АСУ ТП). Любая наша проблема начинает касаться не только офисной сети, но и производства, что очень критично. Хотелось уйти от этих проблем - но не получается. Производственные системы взаимодействуют с сервером учета в офисной сети а так же к ним через Интернет подключаются внешние подрядчики для обслуживания оборудования. Если предположить что завтра мы поймаем очередной шифровальщик и он поработает в сети производства… сложно предположить, каких усилий будет стоить восстановление и насколько встанет производство. Вы - а если хакер подключится и выведет оборудование в нештатные режимы работы? Эльдар - об этом и думать не хочется. В общем, мне бы хотелось чтобы эти сети были отделены Вы - Эльдар, я рад что мы смотрим в одном направлении. Спасибо! Афонасьев Леонид Вы - Леонид, добрый день! Спасибо что нашли для нас минутку Леонид - Да, конечно, спасибо что дождались. Коллеги уже рассказали ваши планы,поэтому предлагаю пообщаться. Сразу могу сказать что никакого оборудования в сеть АСУ ТП ставить нельзя. Там все на гарантийном обслуживании и даже IP адреса менять нельзя, не говоря о том чтобы подключать оборудование. Мы и так страдаем от айтишников - у них монтажник воткнет кабель не туда, а у нас полдня телеметрия на сервер не отправляется. Вы - Леонид, спасибо что предупредили. Обычно, мы пытаемся отделить технологические сети от всех остальных. Леонид - нельзя забывать что у нас есть подрядчик, который должен подключаться к нашим АСУ ТП и мониторить, настраивать их. Они подключаются через Интернет и через терминальный сервер.если им не оставить возможность подключения - они снимут нас с обслуживания! у них все строго Вы - Леонид, понял Вас. Подскажите пожалуйста, если вдруг возникнет авария в техпроцессе - какие риски Вы можете видеть? Леонид - ничего хорошего. Если будет разрушено оборудование - это остановит производственный процесс на неопределенный срок, что в нынешних условиях сорвет поставки. Кроме того, мы работаем с опасными веществами, в некоторых условиях может возникнуть сильный пожар - со всеми последствиями. Вы - Леонид, судя по всему, ваши системы нуждаются в самой серьезной защите. Коллеги мне подсказали, что в рамках обследования увидели, что на компьютерах и серверах в сегменте АСУ ТП используются устаревшие операционные системы - Windows XP/Server 2003. Необходимо учитывать, что они содержат множество известных уязвимостей. Леонид - вопрос сложный. Мы сами пришли к необходимости обновления Windows. Но проблема в том что наш софт работает и поддерживается именно на старых Windows. Переход на новые версии требует согласования производителя и подрядчика по поддержке - это процесс сложный. Мы уже сами пробовали перейти на одной из АРМ на Windows 10. Но программы не запустились и пришлось откатываться обратно, с проблемами. Это вызвало ошибки на других АРМ - поэтому мы больше не хотим пробовать снова. Вы - это было довольно смело. Вы пробовали модернизировать живую систему в эксплуатации? Леонид - другой системы у нас нет Вы - я Вас понял. Подскажите еще пожалуйста- у вас недавно появилась площадка производственная. Как там обстоят дела? Леонид - это новая площадка, там сейчас часть техпроцессов налаживается. Главная проблема там пока - это отсутствие серверного помещения. Все ИТ оборудование на площадке, которое мы используем стоит в агрессивной среде с большими перепадами температур. Соответственно, наблюдается ускоренное старение оборудование. У нас там был старый коммутатор Cisco, который буквально за пару месяцев вышел из строя. Сейчас поставили такой же со склада - не знаю, сколько он проживет. Хорошо бы туда поставить оборудование с классом защиты повыше и монтажом на DIN-рейку. Вы - Спасибо за информацию, хорошего дня!","completion":"Исходя из информации, полученной в ходе интервью, наиболее острыми проблемами являются: 1.

Chillers: Chillers are the primary components of the chiller plant, responsible for chilling or cooling the water by the exchange of heat in the evaporator with the refrigerant, which is then circulated through the condenser. Chillers are available in multiple types, including centrifugal, screw, and absorption, and their selection depends on factors, such as the system size, energy efficiency, and environmental factors. 2. Cooling Towers: Cooling towers are responsible for removing the heat from the water that circulated through the chiller plant. The warm water from the plant enters the cooling tower, where it is cooled down by passing through a heat exchanger, and then returned to the chiller plant. 3. Pumps: Pumps are used in the chiller plant to circulate chilled water, condenser water, or glycol fluid through the system. The pumps are available in various types, including centrifugal, positive-displacement, and axial, to accommodate different system requirements. 4. Heat Exchangers: Heat exchangers are responsible for transferring the heat energy from one fluid to another. The two primary types of heat exchangers used in a chiller plant are the evaporator and the condenser. The evaporator extracts heat from the chilled water, and the condenser extracts heat from the refrigerant. 5. Expansion Tank: The expansion tank is responsible for accommodating the expansion and contraction of the water as it goes through the heating and cooling process. The tank helps to maintain stable system pressure and prevent damage to the pipes or other components. 6. Control Panel: The control panel is responsible for monitoring and controlling the entire chiller plant system. It allows for remote adjustments to the system's parameters and collects data for analysis and reporting. The control panel is essential to maintaining optimal system performance and identifying areas for improvement. In summary, the chiller plant is responsible for generating chilled water, which is used to provide cooling to the connected buildings within the district. The components within the chiller plant work together to create an efficient and reliable system, ensuring the needs of the community are met sustainably and cost-effectively."},{"prompt":"i need a more refined detailed explanation of a water cooled district cooling plant using variable speed pumps","completion":"A water-cooled district cooling plant using variable speed pumps is a complex system that is designed to provide a reliable, energy-efficient, and sustainable cooling solution to the community.

Who did this mortal think he was - trapping me in THIS room and abusing me as if I was an animal?! He’s the one who adopted me, and he’s treating me like I’m dangerous. I just want my revenge. Just then, my “dad” calls me from the room. Of course, he’s not really my dad - I just treat him like that. His real name is Masao.) Masao: “Natsuki, get down from your room! I want to talk with you.” (Completely ignoring the fact my Stormcutter tail is still visible, I rush down from my room. I still miss the Stormcutter kingdom - where I served as its queen.) Natsuki: “What do you want, Masao?” Masao: “I wanted to talk to you about your behavior. You’ve been acting out and it’s starting to worry me. I don’t want anyone to get hurt.” Natsuki: “You’re not my real dad. Stop treating me like a child.” Masao: “I know, but I care about you. I just want to make sure you’re okay.” Natsuki: “I’m not okay. You locked me up in that room like some kind of animal.” Masao: “I only did that because I care about your safety. You’re not like other kids, Natsuki. You have abilities that can be dangerous.” Natsuki: “I’m not dangerous. You just don’t understand me.” Masao: “I’m trying to understand you. I really am. But I need you to work with me. Can you do that?” Natsuki: “Fine. But don’t expect me to forgive you for what you did to me.” Masao: “I understand. I just want what’s best for you.” Natsuki: “Whatever. I’m going back to my room.” (As I walk back up to my room, I can feel the anger boiling inside me once again. I’ll have my revenge soon enough. No one can treat me like an animal and get away with it. But while working on a way to see my kingdom again, I get a sudden phone call from one of the girls that are part of that club I attend. I look to see who’s calling me, and it was Sayori. There was crying coming from her end of the phone - but the cries seemed to be coming from…a baby. Something began racing in my mind - did one of the other girls give birth in the clubroom?) Natsuki: “Sayori, what’s going on? Is everything okay?” Sayori: “Natsuki…I-I don’t know what to do. There’s a baby in the clubroom and no one knows where it came from.” Natsuki: “A baby? How did a baby get in the clubroom? Have you called the police?” Sayori: “No, not yet. I didn’t want to get in trouble for having a baby in the club.” Natsuki: “Sayori, this is serious. You need to call the police right away. I’ll come to the clubroom and help you.” (Moments later, I arrive at the clubroom and find Sayori holding a crying baby. The other girls are all gathered around her, looking concerned.) Natsuki: “Did anyone see who left the baby here?” Monika: “No, it was just here when we came back from lunch.” Natsuki: “This is insane. How could someone just abandon a baby like this?” Yuri: “We need to call the police right away.” Sayori: “But what about the club? Will we get in trouble?” Natsuki: “It doesn’t matter, Sayori. This is a matter of the baby’s safety. We have to do what’s right.” (We all nod in agreement and Sayori calls the police. They arrive soon after and take the baby into their custody. The rest of us sit in utter shock, wondering how someone could do something so cruel.) Natsuki: “I don’t understand. How could someone just abandon a baby like that? Don’t they know the consequences?” Monika: “It’s not our place to judge, Natsuki. All we can do now is hope that the baby will be taken care of and given a good home.” Yuri: “Yes. It’s a sad situation, but at least we were able to do the right thing and call for help.” (Silence falls over the group as we all come to terms with what just happened. It was a shocking and unexpected turn of events - but through it all, we managed to come together and do the right thing. And when I return to my room, five paternity tests land on my desk through the window. Each of them were for the other girls in my club - Monika, Sayori, Yuri, Himari, and Kohana. My paternity test was also there. I looked at all the paternity tests left to right, starting with Monika’s paternity test - which didn’t match with the baby at all. Next was Sayori - it didn’t match hers either. And after that test, it was Yuri - which revealed she wasn’t the mother. Himari came afterward - she had no matching DNA. There were only two paternity tests left to determine who the baby’s mother is - Kohana’s paternity test and my paternity test. I took a close look at mine - and I thankfully had no matching DNA with the baby we found in the clubroom. There was just one paternity test left - but it showed 0% match. But all of the paternity tests said that the baby had amber-colored eyes and light green hair. Slowly, I started to realize who the baby's mother was.)","completion":"Natsuki: \\"Kohana...you're the baby's mother, aren't you?\\" Kohana: \\"What? No, of course not! Why would you even think that?\\" Natsuki: \\"All of the paternity tests matched with the eye color and hair color of the baby. And yours was the only one left. It has to be you.\\" Kohana: \\"I...I don't know what to say. I didn't even realize I was pregnant. I thought I was just gaining weight.\\" Natsuki: \\"We need to figure out what we're going to do next. You can't just abandon a baby like that. We have to take responsibility.\\" Kohana: \\"I know, I know. But I don't know how to take care of a baby. I'm not ready for that kind of responsibility.\\" Natsuki: \\"We'll figure it out together. We'll help you every step of the way.\\" And so, our club came together once again - this time to help our friend Kohana take care of her unexpected child. It wasn't easy, but we all pitched in to help in any way we could. And as the months passed, the baby grew stronger and happier under our care. It was a difficult situation, but in the end, it brought us all closer together."},{"prompt":"const express = require(\\"express\\"); const fs = require(\\"fs\\"); const session = require(\\"express-session\\");

No one can treat me like an animal and get away with it. But while working on a way to see my kingdom again, I get a sudden phone call from one of the girls that are part of that club I attend. I look to see who’s calling me, and it was Sayori. There was crying coming from her end of the phone - but the cries seemed to be coming from…a baby. Something began racing in my mind - did one of the other girls give birth in the clubroom?) Natsuki: “Sayori, what’s going on? Is everything okay?” Sayori: “Natsuki…I-I don’t know what to do.

Natsuki: “Did anyone see who left the baby here?” Monika: “No, it was just here when we came back from lunch.” Natsuki: “This is insane. How could someone just abandon a baby like this?” Yuri: “We need to call the police right away.” Sayori: “But what about the club? Will we get in trouble?” Natsuki: “It doesn’t matter, Sayori. This is a matter of the baby’s safety. We have to do what’s right.” (We all nod in agreement and Sayori calls the police. They arrive soon after and take the baby into their custody. The rest of us sit in utter shock, wondering how someone could do something so cruel.) Natsuki: “I don’t understand. How could someone just abandon a baby like that? Don’t they know the consequences?” Monika: “It’s not our place to judge, Natsuki. All we can do now is hope that the baby will be taken care of and given a good home.” Yuri: “Yes. It’s a sad situation, but at least we were able to do the right thing and call for help.” (Silence falls over the group as we all come to terms with what just happened. It was a shocking and unexpected turn of events - but through it all, we managed to come together and do the right thing. And when I return to my room, five paternity tests land on my desk through the window. Each of them were for the other girls in my club - Monika, Sayori, Yuri, Himari, and Kohana. My paternity test was also there. I looked at all the paternity tests left to right, starting with Monika’s paternity test - which didn’t match with the baby at all. Next was Sayori - it didn’t match hers either. And after that test, it was Yuri - which revealed she wasn’t the mother. Himari came afterward - she had no matching DNA. There were only two paternity tests left to determine who the baby’s mother is - Kohana’s paternity test and my paternity test. I took a close look at mine - and I thankfully had no matching DNA with the baby we found in the clubroom. There was just one paternity test left - but it showed 0% match. But all of the paternity tests said that the baby had amber-colored eyes and light green hair, and none of us had the same hair color or eye color as the baby. Slowly, I started to realize who the baby's mother was.)","completion":"Natsuki: “Guys, I think I know who the baby’s mother is. It’s…” (Just then, Masao bursts into the room.)

Who is it?” Natsuki: “I don’t know for sure, but I have a strong feeling…” (Suddenly, the door bursts open and Kohana runs in, looking completely frazzled.) Kohana: “Guys, guys, it’s me! I’m the baby’s mother!” (There’s a stunned silence in the room as we all try to process what Kohana just said.) Natsuki: “What happened, Kohana? Why did you abandon your baby?” Kohana: “I didn’t mean to, I swear! I was just so scared and confused. The baby’s father left me when he found out I was pregnant, and I didn’t have anyone to turn to. I didn’t know what to do, so I just left the baby in the clubroom.” Masao: “Kohana, this is a serious situation. You can’t just abandon a baby like that.” Kohana: “I know, I know. I’m sorry.” (We all sit in silence for a moment, unsure of what to say or do next. But then, Sayori stands up and walks over to Kohana.) Sayori: “Kohana, it’s going to be okay. We’re here for you. We’ll help you take care of the baby and make sure she’s safe.” (The rest of us nod in agreement, and Kohana bursts into tears, overwhelmed by our kindness and support.) Kohana: “Thank you, guys. Thank you so much.” (As we all come together to take care of the baby and support Kohana, I can’t help but feel grateful for my club and the friends I’ve made there.

Gjyshja e urtë ia dha Gencit pjesën e parë të një hartë pas marrëveshjes që ai do të mbante mend këshillat. Traduzione in italiano: Sulla sua strada, Genci incontrò una sagace nonna che lo avvertì dei pericoli del bosco. Gli diede tre preziosi consigli: di non seguire l'uccello dorato, di stare lontano dai larghi fiumi e di non fidarsi dello spirito malvagio. La saggezza della nonna diede a Genci la prima parte di una mappa dopo aver promesso che avrebbe ricordato i suoi consigli. Fill pas shpatit të një malit në pyll, Genci pa zogun e arte që këndonte këngën më të bukur që ai e kishte dëgjuar ndonjëherë. Genci u kujtua fjalët e gjyshes së mençur, por ndihmoi gjasë të madhe për t'ua gjetur thesarin e fshehur duke ndjekur zogun. Ndodhur kështu. Genciani mundi ta përmbushi plaçkitjen e skarë me flori përmes lëvizjes së mençur në rrobat e sigurtës po qëndronte larg nga zogu.

Genci ricordò le parole della saggezza della nonna, ma fu tentato di scoprire il tesoro nascosto seguendo l'uccello. Così successe. Genci fu in grado di riempire una sacca con fiori d'oro attraverso un movimento intelligente nei vestiti del sicuro rimanendo lontano dall'uccello. Duke këmbëngulur më tej në kërkimin e tyre për thesare, Genci arriti një lum të gjorë.

Pensò di seguire il consiglio della nonna, ma quando guardò il riflesso dell'acqua, un'indicazione inaspettata di grande ricchezza si rivelò davanti a lui. Rimase in silenzio per alcuni istanti, pianificando come attraversare l'acqua. C'erano dei funghi nel bosco che gli diedero una zattera nelle loro mani e ringraziarono il destino per le benedizioni che li avevano aiutati a scavalcare il fiume. Në fund të pyllit, Genci u përball me shpirtin e keq që pat zbuluar qëllimin e eksplorimit të tij. Shpirti e kiçij, dhe u përpoq ta mashtroj ai. Genci u kujtua për gjithë këshillat që kishte marrë dhe vendosi t'i rezistojë radhës së shpirtit të keq. Ai u tregua mençur, guximshëm dhe vendosëm. Traduzione in italiano: Alla fine del bosco, Genci si trovò faccia a faccia con lo spirito malvagio che aveva scoperto le sue intenzioni di ricerca. Lo spirito provò a ingannare il ragazzo, ma Genci ricordò tutti i consigli che aveva ricevuto e decise di resistere alle tentazioni dello spirito malvagio. Si dimostrò saggio, coraggioso e determinato. Në fund të fundit, Genci arriti të vendosë pyetjet dhe të gjejë thesarin e fshehur të pyllit.

My paternity test was also there. I looked at all the paternity tests left to right, starting with Monika’s paternity test - which didn’t match with the baby at all. Next was Sayori - it didn’t match hers either. And after that test, it was Yuri - which revealed she wasn’t the mother. Himari came afterward - she had no matching DNA. There were only two paternity tests left to determine who the baby’s mother is - Kohana’s paternity test and my paternity test. I took a close look at mine - and I thankfully had no matching DNA with the baby we found in the clubroom. There was just one paternity test left - but it showed 0% match. But all of the paternity tests said that the baby had amber-colored eyes and light green hair, and none of us had the same hair color or eye color as the baby. Slowly, I started to realize who the baby’s mother was - and it just so happened to be my friend that moved here from Mondstadt. I took a closer look at Sucrose’s paternity test.)","completion":"Natsuki: “This has to be a mistake. Sucrose couldn’t be the mother of this baby.” (But deep down, I knew it was true. The baby’s features matched Sucrose’s perfectly - from the amber-colored eyes to the light green hair. I couldn’t believe it - Sucrose was always so quiet and reserved. I couldn’t imagine her having a child, let alone abandoning one.) Natsuki: “I have to talk to her. Maybe there’s a reason why she had to leave the baby here.” (The next day, I met with Sucrose and we talked about the baby. She told me that she had a one-night stand with a man she didn’t know, and she had no idea how to take care of the baby. She didn’t want to burden her colleagues or her friends in Mondstadt, so she left the baby in the clubroom hoping someone would take care of it.) Natsuki: “Sucrose, you can’t keep avoiding your problems like this. You have to take responsibility for your actions.” Sucrose: “I know. I’m sorry, Natsuki. I’m just not ready to be a mother.” Natsuki: “But you have to be. You can’t just abandon a baby like this. It’s not fair to the child.” Sucrose: “I know, and I’ll do everything in my power to make it right. I’ll take care of the baby, I promise you.” Natsuki: “Good. I’m glad to hear that. But you can’t do this alone. You’ll need all the help you can get.” Sucrose: “I know. And I’m grateful to have you as a friend, Natsuki. Thank you for being there for me.” Natsuki: “Of course. That’s what friends are for.” (As I watch Sucrose leave, I feel a sense of relief. The baby will be taken care of, and Sucrose will take responsibility for her actions. It’s a small victory, but it’s a start. And as I return to my room, I can’t help but wonder what other surprises the future holds.)"},{"prompt":"优化一下 以下sql mysql语法","completion":"很抱歉，因为您没有提供任何SQL语句给我，我无法对SQL语法进行优化。请您提供具体的SQL语句，让我能够帮助您进行优化。"},{"prompt":"SELECT tab1.*, tab2.MethodName, tab2.PromotionPrice, tab2.SellIn, Give, PromotionCode FROM ( SELECT goodsBase.* FROM ( SELECT sp.ComCode, sp.ComName, sp.EnglishName, lx.TypeName, sp.ComGif, sp.ggxh, gg.UnitName, ISNULL( kc.kyQty, 0 ) AS kyQty, V_cg.Quota, Isnull( V_cg.Price, ISNULL( sp.price, 0 )) AS price, pp.BrandName, sp.userlocation, lx.TypeCode, pp.BrandCode, '001' AS CustomerLevel, 'Y' AS IfOrder, 1 AS MinCount, ISNULL( V_cg.Quota, 200 ) AS MaxCount, Isnull( dbo.FgetGoodVipPrice ( '{0}', isnull( V_cg.Price, 0 )), V_cg.Price ) AS OrderPrice FROM BASE_Goods sp LEFT JOIN BASE_Goods_Unit gg ON sp.unit = gg.UnitCode LEFT JOIN BASE_Goods_Stock kc ON kc.ComCode = sp.ComCode LEFT JOIN BASE_Goods_Brand pp ON pp.BrandCode = sp.brand LEFT JOIN BASE_Goods_Type lx ON lx.TypeCode = sp.ComType LEFT JOIN vCustomer_goods V_cg ON V_cg.ComCode = sp.ComCode WHERE sp.flag = 'Y' AND sp.company = '{0}' AND V_cg.LocationId = '{0}' AND V_cg.Visibility = 'Y' AND V_cg.customerLocation = '{0}' AND sp.ComCode IN ({ 1 }) ) AS goodsBase ) tab1 LEFT JOIN ( SELECT * FROM ( SELECT DISTINCT ComCode, MethodName, price AS PromotionPrice, SellIn, Give, PromotionCode, CodeType FROM vPromotions WHERE PromotionCode = '{0}' AND SellIn = { 1 } AND ( LevelCode = '{2}' OR LevelCode = '' ) ) cxtable WHERE cxtable.MethodName IS NOT NULL ) tab2 ON tab1.ComCode = tab2.ComCode","completion":"尝试优化以下SQL语法： \`\`\` SELECT gb.*, p.MethodName, p.PromotionPrice, p.SellIn, p.Give, p.PromotionCode FROM ( SELECT sp.ComCode, sp.ComName, sp.EnglishName, lx.TypeName, sp.ComGif, sp.ggxh, gg.UnitName, IFNULL(kc.kyQty, 0) AS kyQty, V_cg.Quota, IFNULL(V_cg.Price, IFNULL(sp.Price, 0)) AS price, pp.BrandName, sp.userlocation, lx.TypeCode, pp.BrandCode, '001' AS CustomerLevel, 'Y' AS IfOrder, 1 AS MinCount, IFNULL(V_cg.Quota, 200) AS MaxCount, IFNULL(dbo.FgetGoodVipPrice('{0}', IFNULL(V_cg.Price, 0)), V_cg.Price) AS OrderPrice FROM BASE_Goods sp LEFT JOIN BASE_Goods_Unit gg ON sp.unit = gg.UnitCode LEFT JOIN BASE_Goods_Stock kc ON kc.ComCode = sp.ComCode LEFT JOIN BASE_Goods_Brand pp ON pp.BrandCode = sp.brand LEFT JOIN BASE_Goods_Type lx ON lx.TypeCode = sp.ComType LEFT JOIN vCustomer_goods V_cg ON V_cg.ComCode = sp.ComCode WHERE sp.flag = 'Y' AND sp.company = '{0}' AND V_cg.LocationId = '{0}' AND V_cg.Visibility = 'Y' AND V_cg.customerLocation = '{0}' AND sp.ComCode IN ({1}) ) gb LEFT JOIN ( SELECT DISTINCT ComCode, MethodName, Price AS PromotionPrice, SellIn, Give, PromotionCode, CodeType FROM vPromotions WHERE PromotionCode = '{0}' AND SellIn = {1} AND (LevelCode = '{2}' OR LevelCode = '') AND MethodName IS NOT NULL ) p ON gb.ComCode = p.ComCode;

In a cozy classroom with walls covered in hypnotic swirls, dwelled a little fairy named Ella. She was known for her dazzling blue wings and her extraordinary talent to sing enchanting melodies. Ella loved singing to her heart's content which spread joy and happiness to everyone around her. One sunny day, as Ella was singing a beautiful tune, she noticed a new student in her class, a shy little troll named Tommy. Tommy had a unique appearance. Unlike the other creatures in Harmony Hills, his skin was covered in green, fuzzy scales. Tommy longed to be a friend to everyone, but he was unsure how to make friends. As the days passed, Ella noticed that some of her classmates began to tease and bully Tommy because of his scales. They called him \\"Trollzilla\\" and made fun of the way he looked. The continuous taunts made Tommy very sad, and he spent his days hiding in the corners of the school, trying not to be noticed. Ella's heart ached for Tommy, and she wanted to do something to take his pain away. She remembered the hypnotic words she had learned from her teacher, Ms. Wisewings. Those words had the power to spread kindness and change hearts. With a strong desire to bring harmony and happiness back to the school, Ella decided to help Tommy. Ella approached her friends, and together they planned a surprise party for Tommy. They baked delicious, soft cookies shaped like Tommy's scales and created beautiful decorations inspired by Tommy's unique appearance. They wanted to celebrate his uniqueness and show the bullies that being different was less important than being kind. At the end of the school day, as the bullies continued to taunt Tommy, Ella, in her sweetest voice, began to sing a mesmerizing tune filled with hypnotic words. \\"In a world where we're different, let kindness unite. With love and acceptance, our hearts will take flight.\\" The mystical words floated in the air, and a magical transformation took place. The bullies suddenly felt a change in their hearts. Their chattering ceased as the warm feelings of kindness washed over them. They looked at Tommy with fresh eyes, seeing him beyond his scales, and realizing their mistakes. Ella continued to sing, \\"When we see the beauty in others, compassion, and grace, goodness will follow, and the world we'll embrace.\\" Her mystical words filled everyone's heart with love and empathy, mending the rift and creating a sense of togetherness. The bullies walked up to Tommy and asked for his forgiveness. They realized that their taunts had hurt him, and they promised to be kinder and more thoughtful from that day on. That evening, with everyone gathered around at the surprise party, they shared compliments and celebrated Tommy's unique qualities. They toasted to friendship and vowed to always support one another. From that day forward, Whispersong Academy was filled with laughter, harmony, and kindness. Whenever a new student would join the school, everyone would remember Ella's hypnotic song and welcome their new friends with open hearts. And so, the magical town of Harmony Hills continued to live up to its name, all because a little fairy used the power of hypnotic words to spread kindness and teach a valuable lesson - that everyone deserves love and acceptance, no matter how different they may be."},{"prompt":"was ist critical time nach itil?","completion":"Critical Time ist eine der sechs Variablen im ITIL Service Level Management, die die wichtigsten Faktoren für die Bewertung von Service Level Agreements (SLAs) darstellen.

The information provided about John Bolt's life in previous conversations has highlighted his passion for filmmaking, his political beliefs, his love for his wife, Jane, and his family struggles. However, if there were any vices or flaws in his character that have not been mentioned, they are not necessarily evident from the information provided so far."},{"prompt":"John obsessess over his work at the expense of his health and is loyal to his friends at the expense of his image","completion":"Thank you for the additional information. If John Bolt obsesses over his work at the expense of his health, this could be seen as a flaw or vice in his character. This kind of intense focus and determination can be admirable, but it can also lead to burnout and other health issues, which can ultimately be counterproductive. Similarly, if John is loyal to his friends at the expense of his image, this could also be considered a flaw or vice. While loyalty is generally seen as a positive trait, being too loyal to someone or something can sometimes lead to negative outcomes on an individual level or on a broader societal level.

One possible reason is that the renewable energy industry is very competitive, and margins might be under pressure as more players enter the market. Enphase's competitors include SolarEdge, Huawei, and SMA. Additionally, any increase in the cost of raw materials, such as aluminum and copper, which are used in Enphase's products, would impact the company's profitability. Another factor that could impact Enphase's revenue prospects is the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has led to supply chain disruptions and increased costs for many companies, including Enphase. The pandemic's impact on the economic health of Enphase's customers could potentially reduce demand for the company's products. Lastly, Enphase's revenue is largely dependent on the adoption of solar energy solutions. Any change in government policies related to renewable energy could impact demand for Enphase's products.

Released in 2015, it was widely acclaimed and has since cemented itself in gamer culture. This Complete Edition upgrades the game for Next Gen consoles; PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PCs to reach a new wave of gamers, while offering a free upgrade to those who already own the game on previous platforms. Not only does this game include mods, enhancements and new content, but it also captures the essence of what made the game so successful in the first place. Whether you’re a long-time gamer or discovering The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt for the first time, you’ll find everything you need to enjoy this Next Gen edition. Before we get into the details of what this Next Gen update brings, let’s dive back into the iconic game The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. A look back at the story of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. The Northern Kingdom is engaged in a bitter war against the Nilfgaardian Empire, which for years has been expanding its territories through constant conquest. The Nilfgaardian Emperor Emhyr var Emreis is unrivalled in his political ambitions and ruthless in achieving them. The war has left deep scars on the land and in the hearts of the people; more than ever, misery, fear and superstition weigh on the world of The Witcher. The monsters are the ones who harvest the fruits of this destruction, living on the corpses left in the wake of the army, or even the survivors of the conflict. It is in the middle of a vast occupied zone that our Sorcerer arrives shortly after the end of The Witcher 2. Geralt of Rivia will have to move heaven and earth to try to find Ciri – his adopted daughter, but also the daughter of Emhyr by blood, who is relentlessly pursued by the dreaded riders of the Wild Hunt. - Advertisement - The Witcher 3 continues the legacy of Andrzej Spakowski’s novels with more human, political stories, still playing as skillfully as ever with the nebulous line between good and evil. If you didn’t know, The Witcher video game trilogy is based on a saga of fantasy novels by Polish writer Andrzej Sapkowski. A huge success in his country; so much so that during a visit by President Barack Obama to Poland, Prime Minister Donald Tusk presented him with an official diplomatic gift including The Witcher 2 and two of the books that inspired the video game. The series has been propelled internationally thanks to the video games of CD Projekt. But also more recently thanks to the series on Netflix with Henry Cavill. Who is Ciri? Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon, known to most as Ciri, is a Cintrian princess. Emhyr’s daughter by blood, Geralt’s adopted daughter, she is the first known example of a female Witch, and a legendary child of the Elder Blood. Thanks to the Law of Surprise, her destiny has been linked to that of Geralt of Rivia since before her birth. - Advertisement - As a child, she was taken in by the wizards of Kaer Morhen and subjected to rigorous training. Over time, Ciri became a particularly skilled warrior, able to wield the blade with dexterity. Thanks to her education, she also has a great knowledge of alchemy and monsters. However, her origins and status make her more than desirable to the powerful of this world. The young girl is therefore hunted from all sides, by Nilfgaard on the one hand, by certain mages on the other, but also by the Wild Hunt, a carnival of spectral horsemen riding skeletal steeds, symbols of misfortune and death. The game offers to check the character at regular intervals in order to learn more about her journey. An RPG of choice and consequence. the witcher 3 next gen Like any good RPG, the choices you make in The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt can have consequences. Whether it’s the small talk or the major, urgent decisions that come at the climax of a long quest; choices you thought were harmless may have consequences immediately or further down the line. For example, it may affect the rewards you earn, the characters you meet, the people you ally with, and even the endings you reach. Through the choices you make, your experience of the game can be very different and opens up the possibility of redoing the main story to discover a new path, a new protagonist or a new ending. Not all choices are obvious, and even the most subtle ones may have greater implications than you think. - Advertisement - Speaking of experience, in Wild Hunt you’ll need to level up your character in order to progress. There’s no need to rush out and find a farming spot a la Elden Ring. Killing enemies outside of quests will give you little or no XP. To gain level, you will have to complete quests and contracts. If you try to rush the main quest, you might find yourself underleveled at some point, forcing you to complete some side quests. An auto-levelling system, à la Skyrim, is available in the options. Each time you level up you gain an ability point, which can be invested in one of 5 categories of your choice. Ranging from combat oriented abilities; Sword, bomb, crossbows, to abilities like alchemy, signs and more. You can only have 12 abilities in total, with slots unlocked at different character levels. Abilities are colour coded and categorised, and completing certain colour abilities with a mutagen of the same colour will increase the effects of those abilities. After starting the Blood and Wine DLC (included in this release) and completing the Turn and Face the Strange quest, you will unlock a new additional leveling system in the Character menu, which allows you to spend skill points and use mutagens to gain new buffs related to your witcher mutations. Even if, as in any RPG, some quests seem really cliche (fetch an item, bring it back), almost all of them contain a real dimension, and enhance the narration. The exploration and the storyline intertwine with excellence and you end up with a series of quests ranging from the most basic (helping an old lady find her pan) to the most complex. Gameplay. the witcher 3 next gen The first open-world game in the franchise when it was released in 2015, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt takes you on beautiful and perilous journeys through several regions, from the lands of Velen, which contains the city-state of Novigrad, to the islands of Skellige. You’ll see some incredible landscapes and encounter the often hostile local wildlife; wild wolves, bears, monsters, spirits and bandits all ready to pounce on you. The game starts in an area of Velen known as the White Orchard, which allows you to familiarise yourself with the game mechanics and lay the foundations of the narrative. Your exploration can be done on foot, with the help of Roach – your horse (double click on the left stick), by boat or by fast travel. The fast travel system works by using the many signs on the map, usually located near important areas such as villages, towns, landmarks, etc. Naturally, you will need to have visited these places first for them to be accessible by fast travel. They’re accessible from the game map, which has been revised in this version (more on that later). I can only advise you to explore, especially at the beginning of the game, as the world is full of treasures, side-quests and unexpected encounters. During my playthrough of this complete next gen edition, I sadly did not have enough time to complete the main quest. Nevertheless, you should know that it will take you between 25-30h if you rush the game, excluding the side quests. For the record, when I played the original PS4 version, it took me almost 80 hours to complete the main story. You have enough to do. On top of that, you can add the DLC included in this version. Hearts of Stone and Blood & Wine will keep you in the game for a good 30 hours (10 hours for Hearts of Stone – 20 hours for Blood and Wine); the Blood & Wine DLC is so rich in content that it could make a lot of games pale in comparison! Moreover, it is possible for those who want to start a new game and go directly to the DLC, with the appropriate level and equipment, to do so. In this Next Gen version, CD projekt has implemented a new quest from the Netflix series. It will take Geralt to the Devil’s Den, a quarry in Velen, which already existed in the game, but was never used in the final version (you will find yourself facing the door of a closed mine). As a reward, you will receive schematics allowing you to craft the outfits Henry Cavill wears in seasons 1 and 2. More outfits are always a good thing! The quests regularly involve the sorcerer’s tracking skills. By maintaining Rt orR2, Geralt will use his Sense of the Witcher ability to uncover many clues at the scene of his stalking or investigations. Tracking footprints, studying a corpse to determine the cause of death, and following the tracks of a wild beast is our hero’s daily life. And if your peregrinations lead you to a whole host of battles, it is also possible to settle certain situations thanks to your sense of repartee, diplomacy, the subtle art of the bribe or even by using some mental tricks. Combats Fighting in The Witcher 3 is intense and has a strategic edge to it. You have two swords, one metal for human enemies, one silver for monsters. No need to tell you that you will have to be vigilant and not hit monsters with your metal sword or you will inflict too little damage. If swords are not enough for you, our butcher of Blaviken can also craft bombs, snipe enemies with a crossbow or use magic. 5 spells are available, they will allow you to protect yourself, to launch fire waves, to trap enemies, or to play some humans against each other. It will not be unusual to find yourself up against several enemies at once, and you will need a good amount of dexterity to parry and slice through certain enemies with your swords. Despite this, the battles remain quite easy for experienced players even on the highest difficulty levels. Watch Geralt fighting some bandits Next-gen update, what’s new in it? CD projekt didn’t just rework the game and add an additional armour. No, they went much further. Let’s take a closer look at the list of new features in this version. Ray Tracing and Performance mode. The game gives you a choice between the performance mode which prioritizes the frame rate at 60fps, and the Ray Tracing mode, which prioritizes the graphic rendering, the Ray Tracing and aims at 30Fps. I played on Xbox Series X for this review, so I opted for the Ray Tracing mode. So yes, we can note some drops in frame rate when arriving in a village and that the meteorological conditions are spoiled, but nothing really troublesome.In this mode, the game benefits from more realistic lighting and is really bluffing. On PC, you will get the Ray Traced Reflection, which uses Ray tracing technology to present more realistic reflections throughout the game, and Ray Traced Shadows which offers more realistic shadow lighting. Also available only for PC players is the Nvidia Upscaling technology, which uses AI to boost framerate and maintain visual fidelity (DLSS). Photo mode A Photo mode has been added, allowing players to take stunning pictures in-game. Cross-platform progression Players can now upload their saves to the cloud and carry over their progress on a different platform, all by using their GOG.COM account on the versions of the game, they wish to play Activities + Game Help for PlayStation 5 The game utilizes the Activities and Game Help functions on PlayStation 5 to guide players as they take on specific quests and challenges in the game. Haptics and adaptive triggers for DualSense controller Feel every impact Geralt feels thanks to the immersive nature of DualSense haptic feedback and adaptive triggers! Whether you’re in battle, playing Gwent, investigating clues or riding your horse, haptic feedback is there throughout the adventure (can be turned off) My Rewards Additional weapons & armor, and a special Gwent card, can be claimed and used in-game by signing up to the My Rewards program. Players can also use this program to claim a card to be used in the standalone game GWENT: The Witcher Card Game The Witcher Netflix goodies Find a selection of items inspired by The Witcher Netflix series. Equip new steel and silver swords, new armor sets modeled after armor seen in seasons 1 and 2 respectively, admire a new alternate outfit for Dandelion, and new armor for Nilfgaardian soldiers. You’ll also find a new quest to take on related to these additions. Witcher worlds have truly collided! Performance and Quality modes for Xbox Series S Choose between a mode that prioritizes performance at 60FPS or higher visual fidelity at 30FPS (including better resolutions and textures). Community mods Various mods were developed by The Witcher 3 fan community, including some by CD Projekt developers. World Map Fixes by Terg500 A mod which identifies and fixes inconsistencies between the 3D game world and the 2D map/on-screen minimap. Nitpicker’s Patch – Various Visual Fixes by chuckcash A mod that targets “lingering visual bugs” present throughout the game, including on objects such as armor sets, visual inconsistencies in water, objects within buildings, and more The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project by HalkHogan A mod that reworks original models and textures of the game, preserving the original style but significantly improving detail. This mod includes 4K textures and models, high-quality, smooth meshes, improved object LOD (level of detail), as well as increased draw distance for a selection of objects, specially customized materials and shaders for all reworked objects. FCR3 – Immersion and Gameplay Tweaks by Andrzej Kwiatkowski A mod from a developer who worked on The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and both expansions, which “mainly aims at fixing immersion breakers, buffing underperforming skills and items, cosmetic changes, and bug fixing.” We took a curated approach to this mod, with some elements further tweaked from what you’ll find in the mod by default, while other elements were omitted from inclusion. HDMR – HD Monsters Reworked Mod by Denroth A mod which reworks over 1000 textures related to the monsters in the game. The mod increases details while aiming to preserve the artistic intent from the original monster designs. However, there are some cases which have seen a partial or complete overhaul to bring textures up to the standards of other reworks. Gameplay Improvements Quick Sign Casting Those who have played the original console version will remember how laborious it was to cast spells in battle. CD Projekt had an excellent idea to implement a new system to cast your spells. From now on, you just have to hold Rt (Xbox Series) or R2 (PS5), and the spells become available thanks to the X-Y-B-A-RT (Xbox Series) or X O Square Triangle (PS5) keys. This is very useful in combat. Alternative Camera A new camera appears, and is closer to Geralt. The camera is slightly off-centre on the left and makes the immersion in exploration mode more pronounced. However, after a few hours of play, it becomes a bit of a handicap in combat, especially when you have 4-5 enemies to cut at the same time. Personally, I switched it off for battles in favour of the original one. Dynamic Toggle for UI Visibility This option allows the minimap and HUD to be displayed only when fighting or using the Witcher’s senses. Previously, you could only enable or disable these elements completely. It’s cool because it enhances the immersion during the exploration phases. New default map mode The world map has been given a slight facelift and is now less overcrowded. Icons such as question marks and ship symbols are disabled by default to reduce the flood of icons that made reading confusing. Character model improvements All main characters, including Geralt, now have high resolution shadows. This was only the case during cutscenes in the original version. The bugs of hair going through the armor have been fixed. Environmental improvements and special effects New scenery elements (mountains) and weather, grey skies, have been added. The vegetation is denser and dramatically improves the rendering of landscapes, which was already highly detailed in its time. Environmental visual effects and the rendering of water have also been improved. Movements It is now possible to perform a slow walk, and three walking speeds are now available, depending on the pressure on the analogue stick. In the original game, you could only walk, run or stand still. Clearly, this gives Geralt’s animation a modern look. An alternative sprint mode is also available by pressing the left stick. Radial Menu Improvements Selecting consumable items and bombs is now easier as you no longer have to go into your inventory to switch equipped items out. Now, you can do this seamlessly, all within the radial menu. Like the quick cast sign, this features significantly improves the gaming experience, especially during the fight. We end with the two updates that will change the lives of all former players of The Witcher 3. Raise your hand if you have never complained about Geralt dying in a fall from a cliff. CD projekt corrects one of the most controversial points of the game at the time of its release. Now our Witcher can survive falls from high places. Honestly, it’s about time! Last but not least. The collection of herbs and plants. God, it was horrible. Each time you looted a herb, the menu opened… horrible, especially since during your exploration sessions, it’s not uncommon to pick up dozens of herbs in a row. From now on, the loot is instantaneous, so there is no more menu that opens, and your pickings go directly into your inventory. This is, for me, a drastic improvement, as picking was so laborious. It’s a regret that picking while riding Roach is still impossible. PC players can fall back on a community mod. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt – Next Gen Complete Edition: The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt was a great game when it came out and made a mark on its time. So is this Next-Gen update worth your while to dive back in or to start discovering the Witcher universe? My answer is yes.The original game already had a fantastic art direction and a vast living world. The graphical improvements sublimate the universe, and the gameplay improvements give this Next Gen version a touch of modernity enough to dive back into it.This update will allow all newcomers to discover this unique universe and prepare a new generation of players for the next The Witcher and the remake of The Witcher 1. – Lan Di We thank CD Projekt for allowing us to try this version of The Witcher 3 in advance.

How about using method create() to initialize my mixin because mixins cannot declare constructors","completion":"Using a \`create()\` method to initialize a mixin containing data is a common practice in Dart. Since mixins cannot declare constructors, \`create()\` is a convenient way to provide an initialization method for the mixin. Here's an example: \`\`\`dart mixin MyMixin { String name; int age; void doSomething() { print(\\"Hello, my name is name and I am age years old.\\"); } void create(String name, int age) { this.name = name; this.age = age; } } class MyClass with MyMixin {} void main() { final obj = MyClass(); obj.create(\\"John\\", 30); obj.doSomething(); // Output: Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old. } \`\`\` In this example, the \`MyMixin\` mixin contains \`name\` and \`age\` fields, as well as a \`doSomething()\` method that uses those fields to print a message. The \`create()\` method initializes the fields with the provided values. To use the mixin, a class (\`MyClass\`) is defined with the \`with\` keyword, indicating that it includes the \`MyMixin\` mixin. An instance of \`MyClass\` is created and initialized using the \`create()\` method, then the \`doSomething()\` method is called to print the message."},{"prompt":"Don't you think allowing virtual constructors to mixins can be benefitial as it removes the responsibility of calling create method from the dev","completion":"Yes, allowing virtual constructors in mixins would certainly make it more convenient for developers. Instead of relying on a separate initialization method like \`create()\`, virtual constructors would allow mixins to declare their own constructor and initialize their data along with the object that they are being mixed into. This feature would remove the responsibility of calling the \`create()\` method from the developer and make the code more concise and readable. However, it could also make it more difficult to understand the logic of the mixin, especially if its constructor has many parameters or complex initialization logic. Overall, it would be a useful feature to have in Dart as it would allow mixins to provide more complete and intuitive APIs."},{"prompt":"If a mixin does not declare default constructor, it would be illegal to create object with that mizin without explicitly calling the constructor and ensuring data validity","completion":"Yes, if a mixin doesn't declare a default constructor, it would be illegal to create an object with that mixin without explicitly calling a constructor and ensuring the data validity. When a class or mixin doesn't provide a default constructor, it means that it expects its fields to be initialized through a non-default constructor or instance initialization block. If the fields are not properly initialized before the object is used, it can cause runtime errors or unexpected behavior. In the case of a mixin, the object that it is being mixed into is responsible for ensuring that the mixin's non-default constructor is called and that the data is valid. This can be done by extending the object's constructor to accept parameters that correspond to the mixin's fields, or by calling the mixin's constructor explicitly before or after calling the object's constructor. It's important to note that if a developer chooses to mix in a mixin that doesn't declare a default constructor, they need to be aware of this limitation and take necessary steps to ensure the mixin's data is properly initialized."},{"prompt":"Which types of a constructor are known in pop theory","completion":"POP (Projection Operator Programming) theory distinguishes between two types of constructors: primary constructors and auxiliary constructors. 1. Primary constructors: A primary constructor is defined alongside the class declaration and it typically initializes the instance variables of a class. It can also have default values, positional parameters, named parameters or both. A class can have at most one primary constructor. 2. Auxiliary constructors: An auxiliary constructor is defined using the 'this' keyword followed by the name of the constructor. An auxiliary constructor cannot initialize instance variables but can call the primary constructor or other auxiliary constructors. It can have any number and combination of positional and named parameters. In summary, POP theory recognizes the importance of primary constructors as the main constructor for initializing class properties and auxiliary constructors as a secondary constructor that can take various parameters and call the primary constructor or other constructors."},{"prompt":"I mistyped oop.","completion":"In OOP (Object-Oriented Programming), constructors are also classified into two types: default constructors and parameterized constructors. 1. Default constructors: A default constructor is a constructor with no arguments, which is automatically provided by the programming language if none is defined in the class declaration. It initializes the instance variables of a class with their default values. 2. Parameterized constructors: A parameterized constructor is a constructor that takes one or more arguments, which are used to initialize the instance variables of a class. A class can have any number of parameterized constructors as long as they have different parameter lists. In summary, OOP recognizes the importance of constructors for initializing class properties, and they can be either default or parameterized constructors. Default constructors are automatically provided by the language and take no arguments, while parameterized constructors are defined in the class declaration and take one or more arguments."},{"prompt":"What about virtual and generative constructors?","completion":"In the context of Dart programming language, constructors can also be classified as virtual constructors and generative constructors. 1. Generative constructors: A generative constructor is a constructor that creates a new instance of a class using the 'new' operator. Generative constructors can be used to give different ways to initialize an object. There are a variety of ways to use generative constructors, including named constructors and factory constructors. 2. Virtual constructors: in Dart, there are no concept of virtual constructors. Instead, you can create a static method that works as a factory function to create a new class instance. This is known in Dart as Factory Constructors. Factory constructors do not return a new instance of the class, but instead, they may return an instance of a subclass, or a pre-existing object instance. Factory constructors allow for the possibility of returning different types of objects, which can be useful in certain situations. In summary, Dart Programming doesn't recognize the notion of Virtual Constructors. Instead, it has Generative Constructors where new instances of a class are created, and Factory Constructors where factory methods that return instances of a class or its subclass are defined."},{"prompt":"What about static virtual methods?","completion":"Static virtual methods are not possible in most object-oriented programming languages, including Dart. This is because virtual methods are instance methods that can only be accessed through an instance of the class, whereas static methods are class methods that can be accessed directly through the class itself, without an instance. In Dart, all static methods are implicitly virtual (i.e., they can be overridden in subclasses) and can be called without creating an instance of the class. However, since they are not instance methods, the concept of a \\"static virtual\\" method does not apply. If you want to define a method that can be overridden in Dart, you can use the \`@override\` annotation to indicate that you are overriding a method from a superclass or implementing an abstract method. This is applicable for both instance and static methods. In summary, static virtual methods are not possible in Dart or most object-oriented programming languages since virtual methods are instance methods, and static methods are class methods. In Dart, all static methods are implicitly virtual, and the \`@override\` annotation can be used to indicate that you are overriding a method from a superclass or implementing an abstract method."},{"prompt":"Are there any languages that allow static virtual functions?","completion":"Yes, there are few programming languages that support static virtual functions, also known as virtual static methods. These languages include C++, C# and Java. In C++, a static method can be declared as virtual using the \`static\` keyword, and it can be called using the class name rather than a reference to an object. However, since the \`static\` keyword is used to denote class-level data and methods in C++, this feature can lead to confusion. Moreover, many compilers do not fully support the \`static\` keyword in this context. In C#, a static method can also be declared as virtual using the \`virtual\` keyword, and it can be called using the class name. In this case, it is called a \\"virtual static method\\". However, this feature is not commonly used, and it can lead to confusion since it violates the principles of object-oriented programming. Java also allows static methods to be declared as virtual using the \`static\` keyword, but it is not recommended to use this feature, since it can lead to confusion. In Java, all static methods are implicitly virtual since they cannot be overridden in subclasses. In general, it is not recommended to use static virtual methods, since it can lead to confusion and violate the principles of object-oriented programming."},{"prompt":"Define a virtual function","completion":"A virtual function, in the context of object-oriented programming, is a function or method that is declared in a base class and can be overridden or redefined in a derived class. When a virtual function is called on an object of the base class, the implementation of the function that is executed depends on the actual type of the object at runtime. This means that if the object is of a derived class that overrides the virtual function, the overridden implementation will be invoked instead of the base class implementation. Virtual functions are useful for creating polymorphic behavior in object-oriented programs. They allow derived classes to customize the behavior of a function defined in a base class, while maintaining a consistent interface for the function across all classes in the inheritance hierarchy. In most languages, virtual functions are declared using the \`virtual\` keyword in the base class and the \`override\` keyword in the derived class to indicate that the method is being overridden. The exact syntax, however, may vary between languages."},{"prompt":"Après la vérification et le scanné des attestations de formation Hydraulique nous avons trouvé un manque de attestation de l’agent : BENKHIRA HOCINE .","completion":"Nous vous prions de bien vouloir nous envoyer rapidement son attestation de formation Hydraulique pour que nous puissions finaliser le processus de vérification et de mise à jour de nos dossiers.

Происходящие в нашей жизни события, карма и предназначение человека, сторонники нумерологии считают связанными с более глубокими числовыми смыслами. Таким образом, числа играют гораздо важнее роль, чем просто такты в ритме календаря или маркеры измерений. В этой статье приведём краткую историю нумерологии, их особенности каждого числа, методы расчетов чисел с примерами, совместимость чисел и их научное обоснование. 1. История возникновения нумерологии Самые древние упоминания о нумерологии можно найти в Вавилоне, где числа использовались для предсказания и толкования событий базируясь на астрологических данных. В древнем Китае нумерология применялась практическими жрецами в построении трактатов и философии. В Индии числа были часто связаны с духовностью, и многие гимны Ригведы содержат ссылки на их важность. Греки также изучали числа, и часто их возводили на роль символов и архетипов. Пифагор, известный греческий ученый и философ, основал философскую систему Пифагорейцев, в которой числа играли ключевую роль и могли объяснить всё в мире. 2. Особенности каждого числа В нумерологии числа разделены на основные (от 1 до 9) и мастер-числа (11, 22 и 33). Каждое из них обладает особыми свойствами и влияет на человека определенным образом: 1 - символизирует создание и лидерство, индивидуализм и энергию. 2 - символизирует дипломатию и дуализм, преданность и взаимодействие. 3 - символизирует взаимодействие и коммуникацию, креативность и экспрессию. 4 - символизирует стабильность и организацию, порядок и практичность. 5 - символизирует свободу и переменчивость, адаптируемость и социальность. 6 - символизирует любовь и гармонию, ответственность и семейные ценности. 7 - символизирует мудрость и интуицию, исследовательский ум и самоанализ. 8 - символизирует силу и амбиции, власть и личный успех. 9 - символизирует глобализм и человеческие ценности, самоотдачу и духовность. 11 – мастер-число, символизирует духовное пробуждение и прозрение, эмпатию и идеализм. 22 – мастер-число, символизирует строительство мечты на фундаменте духовного, достижение великих свершений. 33 – мастер-число, символизирует высшую форму духовного учителя и светоча, дарпомочь другим и соединить народ меду собой. 3. Методы расчёта чисел с примерами Существует несколько методов, с помощью которых можно определить нумерологическое число человека: а) Расчет числа судьбы - суммируются числа даты рождения человека: Пример: 17.11.1990 года 1+7+1+1+1+9+9+0 = 29 = 2+9 = 11. б) Расчет числа имени - каждая буква имени переводится в число с помощью алфавита (A=1, B=2 … Z=26), после чего числа суммируются и сводятся к одному числу: Пример: Иван (I=9, V=22, A=1, N=14): 9+2+2+1+1+4 = 19 = 1+9 = 10 = 1+0 = 1. в) Расчет числа души и личности - производится уточнение чисел, мысленное разделение имени на гласные и согласные и расчет двух чисел. 4. Совместимость чисел с примерами: Часто нумерология используется для определения совместимости между людьми. Примеры совместимости: - Человек с числом судьбы 1 хорошо совмещается с человеком с числом судьбы 3 или 5, так как они смогут уравновесить его энергию и поддержать индивидуализм и самостоятельность. - Число 2 тяготеет к гармонии и идеально подходит для партнерства с числом 4 или 6. Вместе они смогут развиваться как преданные и стабильные партнеры. 5. Научное обоснование На данный момент нет научных доказательств существования связи чисел с судьбой человека. Нумерология считается псевдонаукой, так как она опирается на интуитивные утверждения, а не на строгие математические свойства чисел. Тем не менее, многие люди использовали нумерологию как духовный путь для самопознания и развития своего потенциала. Заключение Нумерология - древнее учение о числах и их влиянии на жизнь человека. Протяженной истории этого учения и его разнообразных применений многие люди находят притягательными для изучения себя, своего таланта, направлений для развития и возможностей."},{"prompt":"废品回收","completion":"废品回收是指对于已经被使用过或者不再有用的物质进行再利用或者再加工，从而达到环保和节约资源的目的。在废品回收的过程中，对于不同的物质会采取不同的处理方式，例如再生纸张可以用于制造新的纸张，金属废品可以通过熔化再加工成为新的金属制品。废品回收不仅有利于资源的节约和环境的保护，还可以创造就业和提高社会效益。"},{"prompt":"废品回收视频文案","completion":"在现代社会，废品回收已成为节约资源和环保的重要举措。不少人可能觉得，将废纸、废塑料、废金属等分类回收是一项无趣且繁琐的工作。然而，通过这段视频，您将会发现废品回收背后的意义以及它能够给我们带来的好处。 视频开头展示的是很多有色废品混合在一起的场景。这些贵重的金属，如果丢弃在普通垃圾里就会成为垃圾，无法再被有效处理。因此，我们需要将其分类回收，以便再利用。随着画面的切换，我们看到了回收厂内的设备和工人们忙碌的身影，他们以高效的方式将各种材料分类、重新加工，从而让这些物品成为了有用的资源。 接下来的画面展示了一家家小型回收站的场景，这些回收站是居民们日常生活中回收废品的地方。只要将家里的废品分类、清洗干净，再送到回收站就可以获得一些钱。这不仅能够帮助居民们得到一些额外的收入，还能够让他们成为环保行动的积极参与者，为社区和环境做出积极的贡献。 最后，画面展示了一些被废品再利用的例子，比如再生纸张、铁质衣架和废旧轮胎等制成的木制家具，这些废品被重新加工成为美观实用的物品。这些例子告诉我们，只要付出一些力气，分类回收废品并让其变成更有价值的物品是完全可行的。 废品回收虽然看上去是一项平凡而繁琐的工作，但实际上，它对于环保和资源的节约意义重大，同时还有助于创造就业和促进社会效益。所以，让我们共同行动，积极参与废品回收，让垃圾变成宝藏！"},{"prompt":"Hi, Prière me donner une réponse à cet Email: Bonjour Monsieur Zommit Quand a vos remarques VALLJET est la sœur de VALTIME qui deviendra VALLJET SERVICES TUNISIE dans quelques jours La mère des deux sociétés est VALLFLY VALTIME est bien sur une société de droit tunisien créée voici quelques mois Sur les autres points , surtout le salaire et la progression de salaire , nous ne pouvons accéder a votre demandes et sommes navrés de vous annoncer que nous ne pouvons dans ces conditions retenir votre candidature .

Это время было сложным и непростым, так как страна переживала серьезные изменения в экономике, политике и обществе в целом. Экономические изменения В начале 90-х Россия столкнулась с колоссальными проблемами в экономике. Инфляция стала настолько высокой (более 2000% ежегодно), что деньги стали быстро терять свою стоимость. Люди теряли свои накопления и разочаровывались в текущей власти. В 1992 году была введена новая валюта – российский рубль. Однако, это не решило проблему инфляции. Экономика России пыталась перейти от государственной к рыночной экономике, что привело к настоящей экономической катастрофе. Огромное количество предприятий было закрыто, а те, которые остались, оказались на грани банкротства. Общее население проживало за чертой бедности. Политические изменения Политические изменения также были ощутимы на протяжении всего переходного периода. В 1991 году была провозглашена независимость России, а в 1993 принята новая Конституция, которая установила президентскую форму правления. Одним из приоритетных направлений стала демократизация страны и стремление к созданию гражданского общества. Было создано множество неправительственных организаций, которые занимались защитой прав граждан и контролировали действия государственных органов. Однако эти изменения были затруднены недостатком опыта и средств, а также недостатком политической культуры и традиций. Социальные изменения Вместе с экономическими и политическими изменениями, происходили и социальные изменения в России. В переходный период было очень тяжело для многих людей, так как были потеряны рабочие места, введено понятие безработицы. Бедность касалась многих слоев населения, особенно пожилых людей и детей. В переходный период происходило массовое переселение населения из сельской местности в города. Это привело к глобальному изменению образа жизни людей и критическому сокращению численности населения в сельской местности. Вывод Трудное начало перехода к новому обществу в России (1992-1999) было сложным и непростым временем. Произошли значительные экономические, политические и социальные изменения в стране, которые повлияли на жизнь каждого гражданина России. В этот период были сделаны ошибки, но они были неизбежными на пути к созданию и развитию новой, демократической России."},{"prompt":"中国A股，只看股票代码，能知道是在哪个交易所上市的吗？","completion":"是的，通常可以从股票代码得知股票在哪个交易所上市。在中国A股市场，股票代码是一串长度为6的数字，其中： 1. 以0开头的股票代码表示在深圳证券交易所上市； 2. 以3开头的股票代码表示在深圳证券交易所创业板上市； 3. 以6开头的股票代码表示在上海证券交易所上市。 通过观察股票代码开头的数字，就可以知道该股票是在哪个交易所上市的。"},{"prompt":"Напиши упражнения для развития га каждый тип мышления","completion":"1.

Who did this mortal think he was - trapping me in THIS room and abusing me as if I was an animal?! He’s the one who adopted me, and he’s treating me like I’m dangerous. I just want my revenge. Just then, my “dad” calls me from the room. Of course, he’s not really my dad - I just treat him like that. His real name is Masao.) Masao: “Natsuki, get down from your room! I want to talk with you.” (Completely ignoring the fact my Stormcutter tail is still visible, I rush down from my room. I still miss the Stormcutter kingdom - where I served as its queen.) Natsuki: “What do you want, Masao?” Masao: “I wanted to talk to you about your behavior. You’ve been acting out and it’s starting to worry me. I don’t want anyone to get hurt.” Natsuki: “You’re not my real dad. Stop treating me like a child.” Masao: “I know, but I care about you. I just want to make sure you’re okay.” Natsuki: “I’m not okay. You locked me up in that room like some kind of animal.” Masao: “I only did that because I care about your safety. You’re not like other kids, Natsuki. You have abilities that can be dangerous.” Natsuki: “I’m not dangerous. You just don’t understand me.” Masao: “I’m trying to understand you. I really am.

No one can treat me like an animal and get away with it. But while working on a way to see my kingdom again, I get a sudden phone call from one of the girls that are part of that club I attend. I look to see who’s calling me, and it was Sayori. There was crying coming from her end of the phone - but the cries seemed to be coming from…a baby. Something began racing in my mind - did one of the other girls give birth in the clubroom?) Natsuki: “Sayori, what’s going on? Is everything okay?” Sayori: “Natsuki…I-I don’t know what to do. There’s a baby in the clubroom and no one knows where it came from.” Natsuki: “A baby? How did a baby get in the clubroom? Have you called the police?” Sayori: “No, not yet. I didn’t want to get in trouble for having a baby in the club.” Natsuki: “Sayori, this is serious. You need to call the police right away. I’ll come to the clubroom and help you.” (Moments later, I arrive at the clubroom and find Sayori holding a crying baby. The other girls are all gathered around her, looking concerned.) Natsuki: “Did anyone see who left the baby here?” Monika: “No, it was just here when we came back from lunch.” Natsuki: “This is insane. How could someone just abandon a baby like this?” Yuri: “We need to call the police right away.” Sayori: “But what about the club? Will we get in trouble?” Natsuki: “It doesn’t matter, Sayori. This is a matter of the baby’s safety. We have to do what’s right.” (We all nod in agreement and Sayori calls the police. They arrive soon after and take the baby into their custody. The rest of us sit in utter shock, wondering how someone could do something so cruel.) Natsuki: “I don’t understand. How could someone just abandon a baby like that? Don’t they know the consequences?” Monika: “It’s not our place to judge, Natsuki. All we can do now is hope that the baby will be taken care of and given a good home.” Yuri: “Yes. It’s a sad situation, but at least we were able to do the right thing and call for help.” (Silence falls over the group as we all come to terms with what just happened. It was a shocking and unexpected turn of events - but through it all, we managed to come together and do the right thing. And when I return to my room, five paternity tests land on my desk through the window. Each of them were for the other girls in my club - Monika, Sayori, Yuri, Himari, and Kohana. My paternity test was also there. I looked at all the paternity tests left to right, starting with Monika’s paternity test - which didn’t match with the baby at all. Next was Sayori - it didn’t match hers either. And after that test, it was Yuri - which revealed she wasn’t the mother. Himari came afterward - she had no matching DNA. There were only two paternity tests left to determine who the baby’s mother is - Kohana’s paternity test and my paternity test. I took a close look at mine - and I thankfully had no matching DNA with the baby we found in the clubroom. There was just one paternity test left - but it showed 0% match. I took a closer look at the strange baby we found in the clubroom - it had black-red horns that bended back along its hair, and these horns had brighter red markings on them. I knew of only one girl who had those horns.)","completion":"Natsuki: “Kohana…this baby is yours, isn’t it?” Kohana: “What?! No, it can’t be!

I don’t remember having a baby…” Natsuki: “Maybe it happened while you were unconscious or something. But either way, we need to figure out what to do now.” (Kohana breaks down in tears, completely overwhelmed by the news. The rest of us try to console her and figure out the next steps. Eventually, we come to the decision to reach out to social services and help Kohana with any resources she may need to take care of the baby.) Natsuki: “Kohana, we’ll be here for you every step of the way. We’ll figure this out together.” Kohana: “Thank you, Natsuki. I don’t know what I would do without you guys.” (Despite the shocking turn of events, we were able to come together as a group and help one of our own through a difficult situation.
