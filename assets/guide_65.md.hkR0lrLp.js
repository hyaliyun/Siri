Thus, let's list and count all adjacencies: - Corners (4 cells, each has 2 adjacencies): (4 times 2 = 8) adjacencies. - Borders (4 cells, each has 3 adjacencies): (4 times 3 = 12) adjacencies. - Center (1 cell, has 4 adjacencies): (4) adjacencies.

Note: Permuting the rows or columns of a valid position on the board does not change its properties. Specifically, if a configuration is losing for player 1, permuting the rows and columns results in another losing configuration for player 1, and the same applies if it is winning. 2. **Symmetry Argument:** If player 1 places the first piece, rearrange the board such that this piece is on the central vertical line but not at the center of the board. This aids in employing symmetry. 3. **Strategy for Player 2:** Player 2 can always respond to each move of Player 1 by placing their piece symmetrically relative to the center of the board. This symmetry ensures that, after every move by Player 2, the configuration remains symmetric about the center line vertically and horizontally. 4. **Middle Row and Column:** Every time Player 1 makes a move on the middle vertical line, Player 2 mirrors it. Hence, Player 1 cannot occupy the central cell, as Player 2 would have mirrored it symmetrically to the middle of the board. 5. **Ensuring Valid Moves:** Player 2 ensures that the positioning of each piece maintains the conditions of no more than two pieces per row and column, mirroring each of Player 1's moves symmetrically. 6. **Proof of Outcome:** Since player 2 always mirrors player 1’s move, the middle row always ends up with an even number of pieces (either 0 or 2) – reinforcing that Player 1 cannot seize an advantage. 7. **Dirichlet's Principle:** According to the pigeonhole principle (Dirichlet's principle): After filling up to 128 moves (only partial occupation of the board), there will definitely be an empty row or column, or other rows/columns that don't reach the maximum limit (2 pieces per row/column). 8. **Critical Position:** Upon symmetrical play, a critical point emerges usually after 128 moves: - Player 2 will have arranged the moves symmetrically such that either: - A full row and column are empty. - Both rows and columns have a single piece. - The placement strategy ensures that there remains a valid move for player 2, preventing Player 1 from making a valid move that could trap Player 2. 9. **Result of Symmetrical Strategy:** Since Player 2 can always mirror Player 1’s move, avoiding occupying the essential central cell and ensuring every move is valid, Player 2 never forfeits a move first. # Conclusion: Player 2 will always win with correct play.

Since x = 82k + 5, let's find a value for y^2 such that (82k + 5 + y^2) is divisible by 41.

For the line to be tangent to the ellipse, the discriminant Delta of this quadratic equation must be zero, so Delta = 36k^2m^2 - 4(3k^2 + 1)(3m^2 - 3) = 0. From here, we find m^2 = 3k^2 + 1. Substituting m = y_1 - kx_1 into the discriminant equation, we end up with a quadratic in k: (x_1^2 - 3)k^2 - 2x_1y_1k + y_1^2 - 1 = 0. Since x_1^2 - 3 neq 0, the product of the roots k_{PA} cdot k_{PB} is frac{y_1^2 - 1}{x_1^2 - 3}. Given that x_1^2 + y_1^2 = 4, this simplifies to k_{PA} cdot k_{PB} = -1. Therefore, even if the slope of the tangent line is zero or undefined, the condition holds, which means PA perp PB. (ii) When the slope of line PQ exists, using the same line equation y = kx + m and intersecting it with the circle x^2 + y^2 = 4, we obtain (k^2 + 1)x^2 + 2kmx + m^2 - 4 = 0. Solving the discriminant Delta = 4k^2m^2 - 4(k^2 + 1)(m^2 - 4) with m^2 = 3k^2 + 1, we get Delta = 4k^2 + 12 > 0. Let's denote P(x_1, y_1) and Q(x_2, y_2). Then, x_1 + x_2 = -frac{2km}{k^2 + 1} and x_1 cdot x_2 = frac{m^2 - 4}{k^2 + 1}. Thus, we have k_1k_2 = frac{y_1y_2}{x_1x_2} = frac{(kx_1 + m)(kx_2 + m)}{x_1 x_2} = frac{k^2x_1x_2 + km(x_1 + x_2) + m^2}{x_1x_2}. Substituting known values, we obtain k_1k_2 = frac{m^2 - 4k^2}{m^2 - 4}. Lastly, substituting m^2 = 3k^2 + 1 into the equation, we get k_1k_2 = -frac{1}{3}. It follows that k_1k_2 is a constant when the slope of line PQ exists. When the slope of PQ does not exist, it can easily be verified that k_1k_2 = -frac{1}{3}. Consequently, regardless of the circumstances, [ k_1k_2 = boxed{-frac{1}{3}} ]."},{"prompt":"There are 20 points distributed on a circle, and 10 chords are drawn such that no two chords share endpoints and no two chords intersect.

Therefore, we define: [ a_{0} = a_{1} = 1 ] 2. **Recursion Relation:** - To develop a recursion for ( a_{n} ), consider connecting one pair of points with a chord, which splits the remaining ( 2n-2 ) points into two independent sets of points. Thus the recursion can be written as: [ a_{n} = a_{0} a_{n-1} + a_{1} a_{n-2} + a_{2} a_{n-3} + cdots + a_{n-2} a_{1} + a_{n-1} a_{0} ] 3. **Generating Function:** - Let ( f(x) ) be the generating function for the sequence ( {a_{n}} ): [ f(x) = sum_{k=0}^{infty} a_{k} x^{k} ] - From our initial conditions, we have ( a_{0} = a_{1} = 1 ), which leads to: [ x cdot f^{2}(x) = x left( a_{0} + a_{1} x + a_{2} x^{2} + cdots right)^{2} ] 4. **Derive Functional Equation:** - Expanding the square term: [ x cdot f^{2}(x) = x left( a_{0}^{2} + 2a_{0}a_{1}x + (a_{1}^{2} + 2a_{0}a_{2})x^2 + cdots right) ] - Rearranging and comparing with the series for ( f(x) - 1 ): [ x cdot f^{2}(x) = f(x) - 1 ] - This gives us the quadratic equation for ( f(x) ): [ x f^{2}(x) - f(x) + 1 = 0 ] 5. **Solve for ( f(x) ):** - Using the quadratic formula to solve for ( f(x) ): [ f(x) = frac{1 pm sqrt{1-4x}}{2x} ] - Considering the initial condition ( f(0) = 1 ): [ f(x) = frac{1 - sqrt{1-4x}}{2x} ] 6. **Expansion Using Binomial Series:** - Use the Binomial Series for the expansion of ( sqrt{1-4x} ): [ sqrt{1-4x} = sum_{k=0}^{infty} binom{1/2}{k} (-4x)^k = sum_{k=0}^{infty} frac{(-1)^{k} (2k)!}{(k!)^{2} (1-2k)} x^k ] - Plugging this back into ( f(x) ): [ f(x) = frac{1}{2x} left( 1 - sum_{k=0}^{infty} frac{(-1)^{k} (2k)!}{(k!)^{2}(2k-1)} x^{k} right) ] 7. **Combining and Simplifying:** - Considering the first few terms and the structure of the series: [ f(x) = sum_{k=0}^{infty} frac{1}{k+1} binom{2k}{k} x^k ] - Therefore, the coefficients ( a_n ) are given by: [ a_{n} = frac{1}{n+1} binom{2n}{n} ] 8. **Specific Calculation for ( a_{10} ):** - Using the formula, calculate ( a_{10} ): [ a_{10} = frac{1}{10+1} binom{20}{10} = frac{1}{11} binom{20}{10} = frac{1}{11} times 184,756 = 16,796 ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{16796} ]"},{"prompt":"a plot ABCD, AF = 30 m, CE = 40 m, ED = 50 m, and AE is a certain length.

Since we don't have a clear description of the shape of the plot, let's assume it's a trapezoid with AE and CD as the parallel sides and AF, FB, CE, and ED as the non-parallel sides. Let's denote the length of AE as x. The area of a trapezoid can be calculated using the formula: Area = (1/2) * (sum of the lengths of the parallel sides) * (height) In this case, the height of the trapezoid would be the perpendicular distance between the parallel sides AE and CD. Since we have AF and CE, we can assume that the height is the average of these two lengths, which would be (AF + CE) / 2 = (30 m + 40 m) / 2 = 35 m. Now, let's denote the length of CD as y. We know that the area of the trapezoid is 7200 m², so we can set up the equation: 7200 m² = (1/2) * (x + y) * 35 m We also know that ED = 50 m, which is the extension of CD, so y = ED = 50 m.

After the fourth power, the pattern of the units digits repeats every four powers because the units digit of 7^5 is 7 again (since 16807 ends in 7), and so on. So the pattern of the units digits for powers of 7 is: 7, 9, 3, 1, and then it repeats. Now, we want the units digit of 7^y + 6 to be 9. We can check the pattern to see which power of 7, when added to 6, will give us a units digit of 9. - If y gives a units digit of 7, then 7 + 6 = 13, and the units digit is 3, not 9. - If y gives a units digit of 9, then 9 + 6 = 15, and the units digit is 5, not 9. - If y gives a units digit of 3, then 3 + 6 = 9, and the units digit is 9, which is what we want. - If y gives a units digit of 1, then 1 + 6 = 7, and the units digit is 7, not 9. Therefore, we need y to be a positive integer such that 7^y has a units digit of 3. From the pattern, we see that this happens when y is a multiple of 4 plus 3 (i.e., y = 4k + 3 for some non-negative integer k).

Let each pile ( i ) have ( l_i ) peanuts where ( i in {1, 2, ldots, n} ). To manage the distribution quantitatively, assign each peanut in pile ( i ) a value of ( frac{1}{l_i} ). Since each pile ( i ) consists of ( l_i ) peanuts, the sum of the assigned values in each pile is: [ l_i times frac{1}{l_i} = 1 ] Therefore, the total sum of values over all piles: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} sum_{text{peanuts in pile } i} frac{1}{l_i} = n ] 2. **Assumption for Contradiction:** Assume, contrary to the statement of the problem, that at most ( k ) peanuts end up in a smaller pile in the new distribution of ( n+k ) piles. 3. **Distribution Analysis:** Since there are ( n+k ) new piles, it means at least ( n ) of these new piles contain peanuts that have at least the same number of peanuts as they originally did or more. For every one of these ( n ) new piles, the sum of the values assigned to each peanut in the pile is at least 1. 4. **Summation Over ( n ) Piles:** Let's denote these ( n ) well-distributed piles by ( P_1, P_2, ldots, P_n ). Then for each ( P_i ): [ sum_{text{peanuts in pile } P_i} frac{1}{l_i} geq 1 ] Summing these quantities over the ( n ) piles, we get: [ sum_{i=1}^{n} sum_{text{peanuts in pile } P_i} frac{1}{l_i} geq n ] However, since the total sum of values over all peanuts must be ( n ), and no peanuts are missing, this part is correct but the logic contradiction lies ahead. 5. **Remaining ( k ) Piles:** In the remaining ( k ) piles, by our assumption, at most ( k ) peanuts ended up in smaller piles. Hence, the sum of the values in these remaining ( k ) piles can correct the summation: [ sum_{text{peanuts in remaining } k text{ piles}} frac{1}{l_i} > 0 ] 6. **Contradiction:** The earlier assumption leads to a contradiction because the sum of values in the remaining ( k ) piles must be zero or positive and must add up to total ( n ) already accounted for greater than or equal to ( n ) in part since distribution calculation stands invalid. Hence the ( k ) piles also need correct distribution analysis leading to contradiction in the remaining piles' calculation altogether. 7. **Conclusion:** Therefore, our assumption must be incorrect, and at least ( k+1 ) peanuts must move to a smaller pile in order to satisfy the distribution. 8. **Conclusion and Final Assertion:** [ boxed{k+1} ]"},{"prompt":"Given a mapping ( f: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} rightarrow {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} ) which is both injective and surjective and satisfies ( f(x) + f(f(x)) = 6 ), find ( f(1) ).","completion":"1. **Given Information:** We are provided with a function ( f : {1,2,3,4,5} rightarrow {1,2,3,4,5} ) that is both injective (one-to-one) and surjective (onto).

The slope of this line is given by the ratio of the change in y to the change in x, which is frac{2 - 0}{-1 - 0} = frac{2}{-1} = -2. Therefore, we have tan alpha = -2. This shows that if the terminal side of angle alpha passes through (-1,2), then it is sufficient to conclude tan alpha = -2. 2. **Necessity**: When tan alpha = -2, this means that the slope of the line from the origin to a point on the terminal side of alpha is -2. This condition is met for angles in both the second and fourth quadrants.

Consider: [ 11(k+h) + 10(n^k + n^h) = 11(k+h) + 10((11m)^k + (11m)^h) ] Since ( 11m ) raised to any power is still divisible by 11, ( n^k equiv 0 pmod{11} ). Thus: [ 11(k+h) + 10(0 + 0) = 11(k+h) ] This implies that ( 11(k+h) ) is always divisible by 11, and hence, ( a equiv b pmod{110} ) for some ( k neq h ). 3. **Primitive Roots of 11:** Next, consider ( n ) which are primitive roots modulo 11. A primitive root modulo 11 is an integer ( g ) such that the powers of ( g ) generate all the non-zero residues modulo 11. The primitive roots modulo 11 are 2, 6, 7, and 8. For ( n ) to be a primitive root modulo 11, we need to check: [ 11(k+h) + 10(n^k + n^h) equiv 0 pmod{110} ] This implies: [ 11(k+h) + 10(n^k + n^h) equiv 0 pmod{110} ] Simplifying, we get: [ 11(k+h) equiv -10(n^k + n^h) pmod{110} ] Since ( 11 ) and ( 10 ) are coprime, ( 11(k+h) equiv 0 pmod{11} ) and ( 10(n^k + n^h) equiv 0 pmod{10} ). This implies ( k+h equiv 0 pmod{10} ) and ( n^k + n^h equiv 0 pmod{11} ). 4. **Non-Primitive Roots:** For non-primitive roots, consider ( k = h ). For example, if ( k = h = 5 ) and ( k = h = 10 ): [ 11(5+5) + 10(n^5 + n^5) = 110 + 20n^5 ] [ 11(10+10) + 10(n^{10} + n^{10}) = 220 + 20n^{10} ] Both expressions are congruent modulo 110, leading to ( a equiv b pmod{110} ). 5. **Conclusion:** Since both primitive and non-primitive roots lead to contradictions, there are no such ( n ) that satisfy the given conditions.

Otherwise, their sum is at least (m-1)^2 + (m-2) = m^2 - 2m + 1 + m - 2 = m^2 - m - 1, which is greater than m^2 - m - 2. Therefore, S also cannot be m-term-sum-related. 3. **Ensuring Minimum Value**: The results from the subsets S and T suggest that n_m geq m^2 - m - 1 to avoid both being not m-term-sum-related. 4. **Verification for Threshold**: When n = m^2 - m - 1, assume N = {1, 2, cdots, n} and divide it into S and T disjoints such that S cup T = N and S cap T = emptyset. Assume 1 in S. If both S and T are not m-term-sum-related: [ 1 cdot (m-1) = m-1 in T. ] Consequently: [ (m-1)^2 in S. ] Also known is: [ 1 + (m-2)m = (m-1)^2, ] so m in T implies m, m-1 in T, and 1, (m-1)^2 in S, thus: [ (m-2) cdot m + 1 cdot (m-1) = m^2 - m - 1 = (m-2) cdot 1 + 1 cdot (m-1)^2. ] Whether m^2 - m - 1 is in S or T, both conditions contradict the assumptions. Hence, there must be a violation indicating S or T must be m-term-sum-related. # Conclusion: Thus, the smallest value of n_m ensuring that at least one partitioned subset is m-term-sum-related is: [ boxed{m^2 - m - 1} ]"},{"prompt":"Given f(x) = 2x + 3 and g(x + 2) = f(x), find g(x).

We can initially distribute one teacher to each of the three classes, leaving us with 2 teachers to distribute freely without any restrictions. Now, let's use the stars and bars method to find the different ways we can distribute the remaining 2 intern teachers to the 3 classes. We have 2 \\"stars\\" to represent the teachers and 2 \\"bars\\" to divide them into the three \\"bins\\" or classes. Each configuration of stars and bars represents a unique distribution of teachers to classes. If n represents the number of stars (teachers) and k the number of bars (class dividers), then the number of ways to distribute the stars among the bins separated by bars is given by the formula: binom{n + k}{k} Thus, for 2 teachers and 2 dividers, we have: binom{2 + 2}{2} = binom{4}{2} = frac{4!}{2!2!} = frac{4 times 3}{2 times 1} = 6 There are 6 different ways to distribute the remaining 2 teachers among the 3 classes. However, this is not the final answer, since we initially distributed one teacher per class in an arbitrary manner. We must account for the permutations of these initial placements. Given 5 teachers (denoted as T1, T2, T3, T4, T5), we're looking at ways to choose which 3 teachers go to each class first. This is a combination since the order of selection doesn't matter. So we calculate: binom{5}{3} = frac{5!}{3!2!} = frac{5 times 4}{2 times 1} = 10 So, there are 10 ways to choose which 3 teachers go into the classes first. The final number of distribution schemes can be found by multiplying the number of ways to choose the first 3 teachers (10 ways) by the number of ways to distribute the remaining teachers (6 ways): 10 times 6 = 60 Thus, there are 60 different distribution schemes.

Thus, the integral in terms of ( u ) is: [ int_{-3}^{-frac{sqrt{2}}{2}} frac{du}{u^3} ] 7. This integral is now straightforward to solve. We use the formula (int u^{-n} , du = frac{u^{-n+1}}{-n+1} + C) for ( n neq 1 ).

Clearly, (S) cannot be less than 0, since there are no negative pairs, and it cannot be more than the maximum possible pairs in a 10-volume set. 2. The maximum number of possible pairs of 10 volumes is given by the binomial coefficient: [ binom{10}{2} = frac{10 cdot 9}{2} = 45 ] Therefore, (S) can range from 0 to 45. 3. Next, we demonstrate that any integer value from 0 to 45 can be achieved by some arrangement of the 10 volumes. To do this, let us start by reversing the order of the volumes, which maximizes the number of disorder pairs. 4. Let's consider a list of volumes ordered from 10 to 1, i.e., ([10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]). In this case, every pair is in disorder. For each pair ((i, j)) where (i > j), there is a disorder.

Switch them to make them ordered correctly, reducing the number of disorder pairs by exactly 1. 6. For example, if in a certain step we swap two consecutive elements (a_i) and (a_{i+1}) such that (a_i > a_{i+1}): [ S rightarrow S - 1 ] 7. By applying such swaps iteratively, we can reduce (S) step-by-step from 45 down to 0.

The equation now becomes: [ 45u^2 - 102u + 45 = 0 ] Solving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula: [ u = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ] where (a = 45), (b = -102), and (c = 45), [ u = frac{102 pm sqrt{102^2 - 4 cdot 45 cdot 45}}{2 cdot 45} ] [ u = frac{102 pm sqrt{10404 - 8100}}{90} ] [ u = frac{102 pm sqrt{2304}}{90} ] [ u = frac{102 pm 48}{90} ] Thus, the solutions are: [ u = frac{150}{90} = frac{5}{3} quad text{and} quad u = frac{54}{90} = frac{3}{5} ] Therefore, the ratios (p:q) can be: [ frac{p}{q} = frac{5}{3} quad text{or} quad frac{3}{5} ] Conclusion: (boxed{ frac{5}{3} text{ or } frac{3}{5} })"},{"prompt":"Given that {a_{n}} is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1, and S_{n} is the sum of the first n terms of {a_{n}}, if S_{8}=4S_{4}, then a_{10}= ( ) A: frac{17}{2} B: frac{19}{2} C: 10 D: 12","completion":"Since {a_{n}} is an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1 and S_{8}=4S_{4}, we have 8a_{1}+ frac{8 times 7}{2} times 1 = 4 left(4a_{1}+ frac{4 times 3}{2} right), Solving this equation gives us a_{1} = frac{1}{2}.

Let's denote them as ( A_1 ) and ( A_2 ). Clearly, in this case, either ( A_1 ) defeated ( A_2 ) or ( A_2 ) defeated ( A_1 ). Therefore, no participant loses directly to the next one in the sequence because there are only two participants.

Let (M) be the centroid of triangle (ABC) and (N) be the centroid of triangle (PQR). 3. We know that the centroid of a triangle divides each median into a ratio of 2:1, with the centroid being twice as far from the vertex as from the midpoint of the opposite side. Hence the position vector of the centroid (M) of (ABC) can be written as: [ overrightarrow{M} = frac{1}{3} (overrightarrow{A} + overrightarrow{B} + overrightarrow{C}) ] 4. Similarly, for the triangle (PQR), using the same reasoning: [ overrightarrow{N} = frac{1}{3} (overrightarrow{P} + overrightarrow{Q} + overrightarrow{R}) ] 5. Since (P, Q,) and (R) divide their respective sides (AB, BC, AC) in the same ratio (k), we can express: [ overrightarrow{P} = frac{k}{k + 1} overrightarrow{B} + frac{1}{k + 1} overrightarrow{A} ] [ overrightarrow{Q} = frac{k}{k + 1} overrightarrow{C} + frac{1}{k + 1} overrightarrow{B} ] [ overrightarrow{R} = frac{k}{k + 1} overrightarrow{A} + frac{1}{k + 1} overrightarrow{C} ] 6.

This implies that for any (i neq j), ( V_i cap V_j = {0} ). 2. **Choose bases for the subspaces:** Without loss of generality, we can denote the subspaces as (A, B, C, D). We can choose a basis for (C), say ({c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4}). For each (c_i), there exist unique vectors (a_i in A) and (b_i in B) such that (c_i = a_i + b_i). 3. **Prove linear independence of the basis vectors:** The vectors (a_i) are linearly independent. Suppose (sum t_i a_i = 0). Then, [ sum t_i c_i = sum t_i (a_i + b_i) = sum t_i a_i + sum t_i b_i = 0. ] Since (sum t_i a_i = 0) and (sum t_i b_i in B cap C), it follows that (sum t_i b_i = 0). Therefore, (sum t_i c_i = 0) implies (t_i = 0) for all (i). Hence, the (a_i) are linearly independent. Similarly, the (b_i) are linearly independent. 4. **Construct bases for (A) and (B):** We can choose bases ({a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4}) for (A) and ({b_1, b_2, b_3, b_4}) for (B) such that (c_i = a_i + b_i). By an invertible linear transformation, we can assume (a_i = e_i) for (i = 1, 2, 3, 4) and (b_i = e_{i+4}) for (i = 1, 2, 3, 4).

There exists a 2-dimensional invariant subspace (S), i.e., (T(S) = S). **Proof:** Consider the characteristic polynomial (p_T(t)) of (T). If (p_T(t)) has only real eigenvalues, then by the Jordan Normal Form (JNF) of (T), we are done. Otherwise, let (a in mathbb{C}) be a non-real eigenvalue with eigenvector (x in mathbb{C}^4). Then (T(overline{x}) = overline{a} cdot overline{x}), hence (x, overline{x}) are linearly independent over (mathbb{C}). The space (V = mathbb{C}(x, overline{x})) is invariant under (T). With (a = x + overline{x}) and (b = frac{x - overline{x}}{i} in mathbb{R}^4), we have (V = mathbb{C}(a, b)). We now show that (mathbb{R}(a, b)) is also invariant under (T). We know (Ta = ka + lb) with (k, l in mathbb{C}). Taking conjugates, we find (Ta = overline{k}a + overline{l}b).

To start, we note that we must verify the conditions r_1 + r_2 > r, r_1 + r > r_2, and r_2 + r > r_1. Since ( r ) is the inradius of the larger triangle ( triangle ABC ), it is reasonable to consider ( r ) to be equal to or larger than ( r_1 ) and ( r_2 ). Therefore, the critical inequality to verify is: [ r_1 + r_2 > r ] Step-by-Step Proof: 1. **Define Key Variables:** - Let ( K ) be the area of the triangle ( triangle ABC ). - Let ( s ) be the semiperimeter of ( triangle ABC ). - Define ( K_1 ) and ( K_2 ) as the areas of triangles ( triangle ABD ) and ( triangle ACD ) respectively. - Define ( s_1 ) and ( s_2 ) as the semiperimeters of triangles ( triangle ABD ) and ( triangle ACD ) respectively. 2. **Express Radii in Terms of Area and Semiperimeter:** Given that ( r, r_1, ) and ( r_2 ) are the inradii, we can write: [ r = frac{K}{s}, quad r_1 = frac{K_1}{s_1}, quad r_2 = frac{K_2}{s_2} ] 3. **Relate Areas and Semiperimeters:** - Since ( triangle ABC ) is divided into ( triangle ABD ) and ( triangle ACD ), the total area ( K ) satisfies: [ K = K_1 + K_2 ] - The semiperimeter ( s ) is the sum of the semiperimeters less the base ( BC ) divided into segments ( BD ) and ( CD ), but we know that: [ s > s_1 quad text{and} quad s > s_2 ] 4. **Combine and Simplify:** Using these observations, we examine the expression: [ r_1 + r_2 = frac{K_1}{s_1} + frac{K_2}{s_2} ] Since ( s_1 < s ) and ( s_2 < s ), it follows that: [ frac{K_1}{s_1} > frac{K_1}{s} quad text{and} quad frac{K_2}{s_2} > frac{K_2}{s} ] Adding these inequalities: [ frac{K_1}{s_1} + frac{K_2}{s_2} > frac{K_1}{s} + frac{K_2}{s} ] Since ( frac{K_1 + K_2}{s} = frac{K}{s} ): [ frac{K_1}{s_1} + frac{K_2}{s_2} > frac{K}{s} = r ] Therefore: [ r_1 + r_2 > r ] Since the inequality ( r_1 + r_2 > r ) has been verified, and recognizing that ( r ) is typically larger than ( r_1 ) and ( r_2 ), it automatically holds that ( r_1 + r > r_2 ) and ( r_2 + r > r_1 ).

To further explore, consider ( f(n + 35) ): [ f(n + 35) = leftlfloor frac{n + 35}{3} rightrfloor - leftlfloor frac{n + 35}{5} rightrfloor - leftlfloor frac{n + 35}{7} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{n + 35}{35} rightrfloor ] 4. We can approximate individual terms in ( f(n+35) ): [ leftlfloor frac{n + 35}{3} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{n}{3} + frac{35}{3} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{n}{3} + 11 frac{2}{3} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{n}{3} rightrfloor + 11 ] [ leftlfloor frac{n + 35}{5} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{n}{5} + 7 rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{n}{5} rightrfloor + 7 ] [ leftlfloor frac{n + 35}{7} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{n}{7} + 5 rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{n}{7} rightrfloor + 5 ] [ leftlfloor frac{n + 35}{35} rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{n}{35} + 1 rightrfloor = leftlfloor frac{n}{35} rightrfloor + 1 ] 5. Thus, we have: [ f(n + 35) = leftlfloor frac{n}{3} rightrfloor + 11 - leftlfloor frac{n}{5} rightrfloor - 7 - leftlfloor frac{n}{7} rightrfloor - 5 + leftlfloor frac{n}{35} rightrfloor + 1 ] Simplifying this, [ f(n + 35) = left( leftlfloor frac{n}{3} rightrfloor - leftlfloor frac{n}{5} rightrfloor - leftlfloor frac{n}{7} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{n}{35} rightrfloor right) + 0 = f(n) ] 6. Therefore, ( f(n + 35) = f(n) + 0 ). This implies ( f(n) geq 0 ) for ( n geq 35 ). 7. Further, verify what happens as ( n ) approaches multiples (like 105): [ f(n + 105) = f(n) + 2 ] This result confirms ( f(n) le 0 rightarrow f(n+105) ge 2 ), implying (f(n) ge 2 text{ for } n ge 105 ). 8.

Each islander makes a statement about the percentage of knights present in the room. Specifically, the ( i )-th islander claims that exactly ( i ) percent of the islanders are knights. 3. Let's denote the number of knights as ( k ). 4. From the problem statement, we know that at least one islander is a knight, and hence at least one statement is true. 5. If the ( i )-th islander is a knight, his statement must be true. Therefore, the number of knights ( k ) is exactly ( i ) percent of ( n ): [ k = frac{i}{100} cdot n ] 6. For ( k ) to be an integer, (frac{i}{100} cdot n) must be an integer. This implies that ( n ) must be a multiple of ( 100/i ). 7. We proceed by analyzing different potential values for ( i ) (which directly corresponds to ( k )) and their implications: - Since ( frac{i}{100} cdot n ) must be an integer, and ( i ) can take any value from ( 1 ) to ( n ), but not all of these values will yield an integer solution for ( k ). Hence, we need to consider combinations where this equality holds true. 8. Since the equation must hold true for ( i ) (where ( i leq n )), ( n ) must be such that it does not contradict the possible values for ( k ): [ n cdot k = 100 ] 9. We recognize that since ( 100 ) must be a product of ( n ) and ( k ), ( n ) must be a divisor of ( 100 ) while maintaining the constraints where ( k = left(frac{i}{100}right) times n leq n ). 10.

When the boat is going upstream, it is moving against the current, so its effective speed is reduced by the speed of the river flow. Therefore, the upstream speed of the boat is ( (6 - v) ) km/hr. When the boat is going downstream, it is moving with the current, so its effective speed is increased by the speed of the river flow. Therefore, the downstream speed of the boat is ( (6 + v) ) km/hr. The distance traveled upstream is 48 km, and the distance traveled downstream is also 48 km.

Since none of the (a_i) can be a divisor of another (a_j) (from the problem statement), the (c_i) values must be distinct. 3. The (c_i) values must be among the first (n) odd numbers, i.e., they are a permutation of ({1, 3, 5, ldots, 2n-1}). 4. Consider the (c_i) values which can be written in the form (2^beta 3^i), where (i = 0, 1, 2, ldots, k) and (beta ge 0).

Dividing the total length into a specific number of segments involves only a few possible division patterns: [ text{Total length} = 2pi ] If the radius ( l = 1 ), the arc length formula ( s = rtheta ) (where ( r ) is the radius) tells us that each arc segment corresponds to an angle of ( 2pi/1968 ). 5. **Conclusion:** We conclude that by placing the 1968 marks and dividing the circle, each mark introduces an arc length that falls into one of the few distinct segment lengths because each division either adds or splits one of the few possible segments repeatedly, remaining within a certain set of segment types. Hence, the number of different possible arc lengths through any number of marks will not exceed three irrespective of the value of radius ( l ).

Let's denote the cost of labor as L. Therefore, the total cost (including labor) is: Total cost = 85 + L The farmer plans to sell each bag for 11 and has 10 bags, so the total revenue from selling the corn is: Total revenue = 10 bags * 11/bag = 110 The desired profit is 10% of the total cost, so the equation for the total revenue including the desired profit is: Total revenue = Total cost + (10% of Total cost) Substituting the values we have: 110 = (85 + L) + 0.10(85 + L) Now, let's solve for L: 110 = 85 + L + 0.10(85) + 0.10L 110 = 85 + L + 8.50 + 0.10L 110 = 93.50 + 1.10L Subtract 93.50 from both sides to isolate the term with L: 110 - 93.50 = 1.10L 16.50 = 1.10L Now, divide both sides by 1.10 to solve for L: L = 16.50 / 1.10 L = 15 The farmer spent boxed{15} on labor."},{"prompt":"( f ) is a strictly increasing realvalued function on the reals.

The difference between 858 and 794 is: 858 - 794 = 64 Since the greatest number that divides both 794 and 858 with the same remainder is 1, it means that the remainder when dividing both numbers by any number greater than 1 will not be the same. Therefore, the greatest number we are looking for is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the difference, which is 64.

To find the initial ratio, we divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor: [ text{GCD}(140, 84) = 28 ] Dividing both numbers by 28: [ frac{140}{28} : frac{84}{28} ] [ 5 : 3 ] The initial ratio of the number of stamps Kaye had to the number of stamps Alberto had was boxed{5:3} ."},{"prompt":"Let a = sqrt{3} times sqrt[3]{3} times sqrt[6]{3}. 1.

The diagonals (AD), (BE), and (CF) of the hexagon are diameters of the circle. 2. **Divide the hexagon into triangles**: Notice that the hexagon can be divided into six triangles by considering the center (O) of the circle and connecting it to each vertex of the hexagon. Specifically, these triangles are ( triangle AOB ), ( triangle BOC ), ( triangle COD ), ( triangle DOE ), ( triangle EOF ), and ( triangle FOA ). 3. **Equal triangle areas**: Each of these triangles shares a common base (a side of the hexagon) and height (the radius of the circle). Since (AD), (BE), and (CF) are diameters, they subtend right angles at the circumference of the circle, effectively splitting the hexagon into symmetrical parts. Thus, the areas of the triangles can be grouped in the following way: - ( triangle AOB ) and ( triangle DOE ) have equal area because they are essentially reflected over the diameter (AD). - ( triangle BOC ) and ( triangle EOF ) have equal area because they are reflected over the diameter (BE). - ( triangle COD ) and ( triangle FOA ) have equal area because they are reflected over the diameter (CF). 4. **Pairing and summing areas**: Let ( S_{AOB} ), ( S_{BOC} ), and ( S_{COD} ) represent the areas of ( triangle AOB ), ( triangle BOC ), and ( triangle COD ) respectively.

Then the king called the advisors and said: It seems to me that the probability of making correct decisions will not decrease if I keep only one advisor and follow his advice. If this is the case, I must fire one of you. If not, I will keep both. Answer me, should I fire one of you? Who exactly do you intend to fire, King Arthur? asked the advisors.

Begin by examining the situation where the king has only one advisor. - Probability that the advisor gives the correct answer is p. - Thus, the king makes the correct decision with a probability of p. 2.

Since the probability remains the same (p), the king deduces that he can dismiss one advisor and still expect the same accuracy in his decision-making. 9. Now, let's analyze Merlin's reasoning for giving an optimal response to minimize his chances of being dismissed: - **Option \\"Yes\\" (advising dismissal):** - If Persifal also says \\"Yes\\" with probability p, - The decision to dismiss one will be definite. - Each advisor has a frac{1}{2} chance of being dismissed. - If Persifal says \\"No\\" with probability q, the king will flip a coin: - There’s a frac{1}{2} chance that the king decides to dismiss someone. - Merlin then has a frac{1}{2} chance of being the one dismissed. - Thus, Merlin’s probability of being dismissed if he says \\"Yes\\": [ P(text{Merlin dismissed | Yes}) = frac{1}{2} p + frac{1}{4} q. ] - **Option \\"No\\" (advising against dismissal):** - If Persifal says \\"Yes\\" with probability p, - The king flips a coin. - If the coin lands on dismissal, each have frac{1}{2} chance. - Thus: [ P(text{Merlin dismissed | Persifal Yes}) = frac{1}{4}. ] - If Persifal says \\"No\\" with probability q, there’s no dismissal. - Thus, Merlin’s probability of being dismissed if he says \\"No\\": [ P(text{Merlin dismissed | No}) = frac{1}{4} p. ] 10. Comparing the probabilities: [ frac{1}{4} p < frac{1}{2} p + frac{1}{4} q, ] meaning Merlin should say \\"No\\" to minimize his dismissal risk. 11. Using the formula for the total probability: [ P(text{Merlin dismissed}) = P(text{Merlin dismissed | Merlin said No}) cdot P(text{Merlin said No}) + P(text{Merlin dismissed | Merlin said Yes}) cdot P(text{Merlin said Yes}), ] where: - P(text{Merlin said No}) = p - P(text{Merlin said Yes}) = q. 12.

Since these triangles share the side ( BP ), their area ratio is determined by the heights from ( A ) and ( C ) to the line ( BP ). 2. **Ratio of Areas:** Given that the area of ( triangle ABP ) is twice the area of ( triangle BCP ), we can write: [ text{Area}(ABP) = 2 times text{Area}(BCP) ] Since the areas are proportional to their respective heights from points ( A ) and ( C ) to ( BP ), the distances from ( A ) and ( C ) to the line ( BP ) must also be in a 2:1 ratio: [ d_A = 2d_C ] where ( d_A ) is the distance from ( A ) to ( BP ) and ( d_C ) is the distance from ( C ) to ( BP ). 3. **Geometric Locus Explanation:** To find the locus of such points ( P ), we seek lines passing through ( B ), such that the distances from ( A ) and ( C ) to this line are in a 2:1 ratio. 4. **Determining the Line:** The required line cannot be parallel to ( AC ) since that would make the distances from ( A ) and ( C ) to the line equal, contradicting our 2:1 ratio condition. Thus, the line must intersect ( AC ). 5. **Intersecting Lines:** There must be exactly two lines passing through ( B ) that intersect ( AC ) such that the distances from ( A ) and ( C ) meet the 2:1 ratio: - For line ( e_1 ), consider ( M_1 ) on ( AC ) such that ( frac{AM_1}{M_1C} = 2:1 ).

There are two cases to consider based on whether n is even or odd: - **Case 1: n is even** - Write n as n = 2m, where m has k-1 binary digits. - Then, f(n) = f(2m) = -f(m). - By the induction hypothesis, f(m) is a multiple of 3 if and only if m is a multiple of 3. - Since n = 2m, n is a multiple of 3 if and only if m is a multiple of 3.

As f(n) = -f(3k) + 1, this will not be a multiple of 3. - Conversely, if m is not a multiple of 3, f(m) is not a multiple of 3, and -f(m) + 1 must adjust appropriately to be a multiple of 3.

Find the expected value of S.","completion":"1. **Define the problem and notation:** We are given a sequence of real numbers ( X_1, X_2, ldots ) chosen independently and uniformly at random from the interval ([0, 1]). We define ( S = sum_{i=1}^k frac{X_i}{2^i} ), where ( k ) is the smallest positive integer such that ( X_k < X_{k+1} ), or ( k = infty ) if no such integer exists. We need to find the expected value of ( S ). 2. **Probability of ( X_n ) being the smallest:** For any ( n ), the probability that ( X_n ) is the smallest of the first ( n+1 ) numbers is ( frac{1}{n+1} ). This is because each ( X_i ) is equally likely to be the smallest. 3. **Probability of correct ordering:** The probability that the ( n-1 ) numbers in front are ordered correctly is ( frac{1}{(n-1)!} ). This is because there are ( (n-1)! ) ways to order ( n-1 ) numbers, and only one of these ways is in increasing order. 4. **Total probability for a sequence up to ( n ):** The total probability that we can use a certain sequence up to ( n ) is ( frac{1}{(n-1)!(n+1)} ). 5. **Expected value of ( X_k ):** The expected value of ( X_k ) in the sequence is ( frac{n^2 + 2n - kn - k}{n^2 + 2n} ). This is derived from the uniform distribution of ( X_i ) and the linearity of expectation. 6. **Sum of expected values:** We need to compute the sum: [ sum_{n=1}^{infty} sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{(n-1)!(n+1)} cdot frac{n^2 + 2n - kn - k}{(n^2 + 2n) cdot 2^k} ] Simplifying, we get: [ sum_{n=1}^{infty} sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{n^2 + 2n - kn - k}{(n+2)! cdot 2^k} ] 7. **Rewrite the numerator:** Rewrite ( n^2 + 2n - kn - k ) as: [ (n+2)(n+1) - (k+1)(n+2) + k ] This allows us to split the sum into three parts: [ sum_{k=1}^{infty} sum_{n=k}^{infty} left( frac{1}{n! cdot 2^k} - frac{k+1}{(n+1)! cdot 2^k} + frac{k}{(n+2)! cdot 2^k} right) ] 8. **Telescoping sum:** The terms ( 1 ), ( -(k+1) ), and ( k ) suggest a telescoping sum. The only terms that do not cancel out are those where ( n = k ) or ( n = k+1 ). 9. **Simplify the remaining terms:** What remains is: [ sum_{k=1}^{infty} left( frac{1}{k! cdot 2^k} - frac{k}{(k+1)! cdot 2^k} right) ] Combining them, we get: [ sum_{k=1}^{infty} frac{1}{(k+1)! cdot 2^k} ] 10. **Recognize the series:** This sum is recognizable from the Taylor series of ( e^x ), where we plug in ( x = frac{1}{2} ), but its constant and linear terms are missing. We can use this to get our desired answer: [ 2 sum_{k=2}^{infty} frac{1}{k! cdot 2^k} ] 11. **Final calculation:** Using the Taylor series expansion for ( e^{1/2} ): [ e^{1/2} = 1 + frac{1}{2} + sum_{k=2}^{infty} frac{1}{k! cdot 2^k} ] Therefore: [ sum_{k=2}^{infty} frac{1}{k! cdot 2^k} = e^{1/2} - 1 - frac{1}{2} ] Thus: [ 2 left( e^{1/2} - 1 - frac{1}{2} right) = 2 left( sqrt{e} - 1 - frac{1}{2} right) = 2sqrt{e} - 2 - 1 = 2sqrt{e} - 3 ] The final answer is ( boxed{2sqrt{e} - 3} )."},{"prompt":"What is the minimum value of boldsymbol{n} for which, in any set of boldsymbol{n} distinct natural numbers not exceeding 100, there will be two numbers whose sum is a prime number?","completion":"To determine the minimal n in such a subset of natural numbers from 1 through 100 such that there are at least two numbers whose sum is a prime number, we proceed as follows: 1. **Analysis of Even Numbers:** - The sum of two even natural numbers is always even. Since an even number greater than 2 cannot be prime, if we choose all even numbers from 1 to 100, the sum cannot be a prime number. - Since there are 50 even numbers (2, 4, 6, ..., 100), we conclude that in a set of 50 numbers solely consisting of these even numbers, no two numbers will have a sum that is prime. From this, n must be greater than 50. 2. **Sum Pairs from 1 to 100:** - We look at pairs of numbers whose sums are prime, using the numbers from 1 to 100. - We notice that the sum of two numbers from opposite ends of the interval (1,100), (2,99), ..., (50,51), all add up to 101. - Since 101 is a prime number, selecting both numbers in any pair will ensure their sum is a prime number. 3. **Application of the Pigeonhole Principle:** - The Pigeonhole Principle states that if n objects are put into m containers and n > m, then at least one container must contain more than one object. - If we partition numbers from 1 to 100 into 50 pairs (1,100), (2,99), ..., (50,51), each pair summing to the prime number 101, to avoid selecting numbers that sum to 101, one must choose less than 51 numbers. - Therefore, if we select 51 or more numbers from 1 to 100, by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least one pair will be selected from these pairs, meaning their sum will be 101. # Conclusion: The smallest n such that any subset of n distinct natural numbers not exceeding 100 has at least two numbers whose sum is a prime number is therefore: boxed{51}"},{"prompt":"f m + frac{1}{m} = 6, what is the value of m^2 + frac{1}{m^2} + 4?","completion":"Given the equation m + frac{1}{m} = 6. 1. **Squaring the Equation**: [(m + frac{1}{m})^2 = 6^2] [m^2 + 2frac{m}{m} + frac{1}{m^2} = 36] [m^2 + 2 + frac{1}{m^2} = 36] 2. **Isolate m^2 + frac{1}{m^2}**: [m^2 + frac{1}{m^2} = 36 - 2] [m^2 + frac{1}{m^2} = 34] 3. **Add 4 to the Result**: [m^2 + frac{1}{m^2} + 4 = 34 + 4] [m^2 + frac{1}{m^2} + 4 = 38] Conclusion: The value of m^2 + frac{1}{m^2} + 4, given that m + frac{1}{m} = 6, is boxed{38}."},{"prompt":"Given a hyperbola with left and right foci at F_1 and F_2 respectively, a chord AB on the left branch passing through F_1 with a length of 5.

Let us define the following differences: a = l_1 - r_1, b = l_2 - r_2, and c = l_3 - r_3. 5. By substituting these definitions and manipulating the equations: - From the second and third equations, we subtract them: [ (r_1 + l_2 + l_3) - (r_2 + l_1 + l_3) = 1208 - 908, ] which simplifies to: [ r_1 - r_2 + l_2 - l_1 = 300 implies b - a = 300 implies a = b - 300. ] 6. Similarly, subtract the third and fourth equations: [ (r_2 + l_1 + l_3) - (r_3 + l_1 + l_2) = 908 - 608, ] which simplifies to: [ r_2 - r_3 + l_3 - l_2 = 300 implies c - b = 300 implies c = b + 300. ] 7.

Alternatively, if a row initially has more white cells, all cells will turn white. - As a result of this step, each row will become monochromatic, meaning each row will be uniformly colored either all black or all white. 3. **Column Analysis**: - At this point, each column in the grid will consist entirely of cells of the same color, resulting in columns that still contain varying numbers of black and white colored cells derived from the initial row coloring step. 4. **Column Conversion**: - Next, apply the operation again, but this time to each column of the grid. Similar to the row operation, change all the cells in a column to the color that is more frequent in that column. - This results in each column becoming uniformly colored (monochromatic, either entirely black or entirely white). 5. **Uniform Grid**: - After performing the row operations first and then column operations, every row and column in the grid will consist entirely of the same color across the entire 99 × 99 grid. - Since all cells within each column are now of the same color and each column is processed to ensure uniformity, it follows that the entire grid is monochromatic, that is, each cell will be colored either all black or all white. # Conclusion: Thus, it is always possible to make every cell in the 99 × 99 grid be of the same color by using the specified operations. boxed{text{Always}}"},{"prompt":"Given that f(x) is a monotonically increasing function defined on (0, +infty) and satisfies f(xy) = f(x) + f(y), with f(3) = 1.

This is because, by definition, a champion is a team that has won against all of its opponents. Moreover, according to the problem definition, if a team A wins against team B, or if team A wins against some team C and C wins against B, then team A is superior to team B. 2. **Step 2: Considering No Team with All Wins** - If no team has won all its matches, let us consider team A which has the highest number of wins. Since A does not have all wins, there exists at least one team that has defeated A. Let's denote the set of all teams that have defeated A as {B_1, B_2, ldots, B_p}. However, since team A has the highest number of wins, for each team B_i in the set {B_1, B_2, ldots, B_p}, there must exist another team C such that C defeats B_i and A defeats C. This means that team A is considered superior according to the problem's definition. 3. **Step 3: Proving the Impossibility of Exactly Two Champions** - Suppose there exist exactly two champion teams A and B. According to the problem's definition, if A is a champion, A must have won against B. However, since there are two champions, neither A nor B has won all their matches, implying there exist teams that have defeated both A and B. Let’s denote the set of teams that have defeated A as {D_1, D_2, ldots, D_q}, and among them, the team D with the highest wins. - Since D has more wins than the rest of the teams in the set {D_1, D_2, ldots, D_q}, D is superior respectively in the matches where it won. Therefore, D would be superior to both A and B. If D defeats A, and A defeats C (for some team C), then by transitivity, D is superior to both A and C, making D a champion. - Thus, D would be a champion argumentatively more superior than both A and B. # Conclusion: The solution shows that either there is only one champion team, or there can be more than two champions, but it is never exactly two champions.

When x > 0, using the knowledge of derivatives, we know that xg(x) is an increasing function on (0,+infty), and xg(x) > 1 always holds, so xg(x) has no zeros on (0,+infty). Similarly, we find that xg(x) has no zeros on (-infty,0). Thus, we reach the conclusion. This problem tests the existence of roots and the judgment of the number of roots, as well as the relationship between derivatives and the monotonicity of functions. It reflects the ideas of classification discussion and transformation, and belongs to a medium-difficulty problem. **Solution** Since the function g(x)=f(x)+frac{1}{x}, we have xneq 0, and thus the zeros of g(x) are the same as the non-zero zeros of xg(x). So, we consider the zeros of xg(x)=xf(x)+1. 1. When x > 0, we have frac{d}{dx}(xg(x))=frac{d}{dx}(xf(x))=xf'(x)+f(x)=xleft(f'(x)+frac{f(x)}{x}right) > 0. Therefore, the function xg(x) is a monotonically increasing function on (0,+infty). Also, lim_{xrightarrow 0}[xf(x)+1]=1, so on (0,+infty), the function xg(x)=xf(x)+1 > 1 always holds.

For each pair ( 0 leq i, j < k ), consider the set of squares in a row congruent to ( i mod k ) and in a column congruent to ( j mod k ). - If one square of an ((a, b))-domino lies in this set, then the other square must also lie in this set. - Thus, we can partition the ( m times n ) rectangle into ( k^2 ) such sets.

Begin by noting that since the polynomial ( ax^2 + bx + c ) is always a perfect fourth power for every integer ( x ), all coefficients must be non-negative: ( a geq 0 ) and ( c geq 0 ). 2. Consider the integer values ( x = 1, 2, ldots, n ). The polynomial ( ax^2 + bx + c ) must yield precisely ( n ) distinct fourth powers if it represents different values for these different ( x ) values. 3. Assume ( a neq 0 ) or ( b neq 0 ), then for ( n ) distinct integer values of ( x ), the quadratic polynomial ( ax^2 + bx + c ) would take at least ( frac{n}{2} ) different values, because otherwise, it would violate the pigeonhole principle considering it maps into the set of non-negative integers. 4. These ( frac{n}{2} ) different values of the polynomial are all distinct fourth powers. Let's denote these fourth powers as ( k^2 ) where ( k ) is an integer. Therefore, each value output by the polynomial must be a fourth power lying between 0 and ( a n^2 + |b| n + c ). 5. The total number of distinct fourth power numbers up to ( a n^2 + |b| n + c ) is less than or equal to ( sqrt[4]{a n^2 + |b| n + c} + 1 ). This follows from the fact that the fourth root of the maximum value gives the number of fourth powers up to that value reasonably approximated by adding 1 to account for stepwise progression. 6. For the number of distinct values: [ sqrt[4]{a n^2 + |b| n + c} + 1 geq frac{n}{2} ] 7. Rearrange the inequality and raise both sides to the fourth power: [ a n^2 + |b| n + c geq left( frac{n}{2} - 1 right)^4 ] 8. Simplify the right-hand side polynomial for large ( n ): [ left( frac{n}{2} - 1 right)^4 approx left( frac{n}{2} right)^4 = frac{n^4}{16} ] 9.

This is possible because we have ( 2(n-1) - 1 = 2n - 3 ) rooks left after placing the first rook. - **Step 3:** Now, we have ( n ) rooks left and need to place one rook on the upper left corner of the ( n times n ) board. We can do this by placing one rook on the cell one lower using ( n-1 ) rooks, then use the remaining ( n-1 ) rooks to do it again, and then move one of the two rooks on this cell one up.

After four moves, Vasya has surrounded all four corner cells with at least one wall each.

Petya cannot move beyond an impassable wall. 6. **Ensuring total blockade**: If a move by Petya threatens to reach an edge cell not yet fortified, Vasya places walls strategically so Petya can't exit in a single move or traps him entirely. # Conclusion: Through strategic wall placements by Vasya in 4 moves initially and subsequent responsive wall placements to every Petya's move, Vasya prevents Petya from moving the chip out of the board. Consequently, Petya cannot secure a win regardless of their actions. boxed{text{No}}"},{"prompt":"An equilateral triangle XYZ has several parallel line segments within it.

Water costs 1 cent for 10 gallons. How many dollars does it cost to fill the pool?","completion":"First, we need to calculate the total amount of water needed to fill the pool. Since the hose runs at 100 gallons per hour and it takes 50 hours to fill the pool, we can calculate the total gallons of water needed as follows: 100 gallons/hour * 50 hours = 5000 gallons Now, we need to calculate the cost of 5000 gallons of water. Since water costs 1 cent for 10 gallons, we can find the cost for 5000 gallons by dividing 5000 by 10 and then multiplying by the cost per 10 gallons: 5000 gallons / 10 gallons = 500 (10-gallon units) Since each 10-gallon unit costs 1 cent, the cost for 500 units is: 500 * 1 cent = 500 cents To convert cents to dollars, we divide by 100 (since there are 100 cents in a dollar): 500 cents / 100 = 5 Therefore, it costs boxed{5} to fill the pool."},{"prompt":"the diagram, the square has a perimeter of 64 and the triangle has a height of 32.

For the 1/4 portions, the stick will be divided into 4 equal parts, so there will be markings at: - 0/4 (the starting point) - 1/4 - 2/4 - 3/4 - 4/4 (the end point) This gives us a total of 5 markings for the 1/4 portions. For the 1/5 portions, the stick will be divided into 5 equal parts, so there will be markings at: - 0/5 (the starting point, which is the same as the 0/4 marking) - 1/5 - 2/5 - 3/5 - 4/5 - 5/5 (the end point, which is the same as the 4/4 marking) This gives us a total of 6 markings for the 1/5 portions.

This reduces the sum, so we assume ( x_1 = 1 ). - We can generalize the problem by considering ( n ) instead of 2017, where ( n ) is sufficiently large. 3. **Ensuring Consecutive Integers:** - If there exists ( 1 leq i leq n-1 ) such that ( x_{i+1} > x_i + 1 ), we can replace ( A = {x_1, ldots, x_n} ) with ( A_0 = {x_1, ldots, x_i, x_{i+1} - 1, x_{i+2} - 1, ldots, x_n - 1} ). This reduces the sum, so we assume ( A ) contains every integer from 1 to 25. 4. **Claim:** - For every integer ( k in {1, 2, ldots, 24} ), at least two of the ( x_i )'s are equal to ( k ). 5. **Proof by Induction:** - Base Case: For ( k = 1 ), we have ( x_0 = x_1 = 1 ), which satisfies the condition. - Inductive Step: Assume ( x_{j-1} = x_j = m ) and ( x_{j+1} = m + 1 ) for ( m in [1, 23] ). We need to show ( x_{j+2} = m + 1 ). - If ( x_{j+2} = m + 2 ), we can insert ( x_{text{new}} = m + 1 ) between ( x_{j+1} ) and ( x_{j+2} ), reducing the sum. Thus, ( x_{j+2} = m + 1 ). 6. **Calculating the Sum:** - For ( i in [2, 25] ), let ( a_i ) be the smallest index such that ( x_{a_i} = i ). - By the claim, ( x_{a_i + 1} = i ) for all ( i in [2, 24] ) and ( x_{a_i - 1} = x_{a_i - 2} = i - 1 ) for all ( i in [2, 25] ). - Therefore, ( (x_{a_i} - x_{a_i - 2}) x_{a_i} = i ) for all ( i in [2, 25] ) and ( (x_{a_i + 1} - x_{a_i - 1}) x_{a_i + 1} = i ) for all ( i in [2, 24] ). 7. **Summing Up:** - [ sum_{i=2}^{2017} (x_i - x_{i-2}) x_i geq (2 + 3 + cdots + 24 + 25) + (2 + 3 + cdots + 24) = 623 ] 8. **Equality Case:** - For equality, every number from 1 to 24 should appear at least twice, and there should be exactly one ( x_i ) equal to 25. - Let ( t_i ) be the number of ( x_j )'s equal to ( i ) for ( i in [1, 24] ). We have ( t_1 + t_2 + cdots + t_{24} = 2017 ) and ( t_i geq 2 ). - Let ( r_i = t_i - 2 ). Then ( r_1 + r_2 + cdots + r_{24} = 1969 ) and ( r_i geq 0 ). - The number of sequences satisfying these conditions is ( binom{1969 + 24 - 1}{24 - 1} = binom{1992}{23} ).

The molar mass of barium (Ba) is approximately 137.33 g/mol. The molar mass of fluorine (F) is approximately 19.00 g/mol. Barium fluoride (BaF2) contains one barium atom and two fluorine atoms. Therefore, the molar mass of BaF2 is: Molar mass of BaF2 = Molar mass of Ba + 2 * Molar mass of F Molar mass of BaF2 = 137.33 g/mol + 2 * 19.00 g/mol Molar mass of BaF2 = 137.33 g/mol + 38.00 g/mol Molar mass of BaF2 = 175.33 g/mol Now, to find the mass percentage of barium in BaF2, we use the following formula: Mass percentage of Ba = (Molar mass of Ba / Molar mass of BaF2) * 100% Mass percentage of Ba = (137.33 g/mol / 175.33 g/mol) * 100% Mass percentage of Ba = 0.7835 * 100% Mass percentage of Ba = 78.35% Therefore, the mass percentage of barium in barium fluoride is approximately boxed{78.35%} ."},{"prompt":"the Cartesian coordinate system xOy, the curve C_1 is represented by the parametric equations: begin{cases} x = 2cos phi y = sin phi end{cases} (where phi is a parameter).

Find the range of values for the length |MN|.","completion":"(Ⅰ) To eliminate the parameter phi, we find the Cartesian equation of C_1 using the formulas for cosine and sine squared: frac{x^2}{4} + y^2 = 1 This is achieved by replacing cos phi with frac{x}{2} and sin phi with y in the parametric equations, which gives us: cos^2 phi = frac{x^2}{4}, quad sin^2 phi = y^2, and taking into account that cos^2 phi + sin^2 phi = 1, we get the equation above. For curve C_2, we know it's a circle centered at polar coordinates (3, frac{pi}{2}) with radius 1. To convert to Cartesian coordinates, we use the relations: x = r cos theta and y = r sin theta. The center's Cartesian coordinates are (0, 3), since cos(frac{pi}{2}) = 0 and sin(frac{pi}{2}) = 1. Taking r = 3, the center is at (0, 3), and hence, the Cartesian equation of C_2 is: x^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 1 (Ⅱ) Let the point M on C_1 be represented as (2cos phi, sin phi). Thus, the distance from M to the center of C_2 can be calculated as follows: |MC_2| = sqrt{(2cos phi)^2 + (sin phi - 3)^2} = sqrt{4cos^2 phi + sin^2 phi - 6sin phi + 9} = sqrt{-3sin^2 phi - 6sin phi + 13} This simplifies to: |MC_2| = sqrt{-3(sin phi + 1)^2 + 16} Since the range of sin phi is [-1, 1], the quadratic function implies that the distance |MC_2| ranges from 2 to 4. Combining this with the graphical interpretation of the problem, we surmise that the minimum value for |MN| is when M is closest to C_2 and N is at the radius' extension away from M, which is 2 - 1 = 1, and the maximum value for |MN| is found when M is farthest from C_2 and N is at the opposite side of C_2's center from M, which is 4 + 1 = 5.

For example, if ( G_1 ) (100g) and (G_{30}) (200g) are selected, transferring milk to equalize would mean (G_1) and (G_{30}) will both end up with 150g of milk. - Thus, after every rationalized pouring, the quantities in selected glasses change, aiming to balance the chosen two. 5. **Achieving the Impossible Equal Distribution**: - Select any glass (e.g., ( G_1 )) and ( G_{30} ): - By balancing, ( G_1 = 150g ) and ( G_{30} = 150g ). - Now, all glasses except these two remain with 100g of milk. - No matter how we pair up and equalize the glasses through allowed operations, the total discrepancy from equal distribution propagates through every step due to the odd quantities and step-by-step transfer methods. 6. **Conclusion**: - It is mathematically confirmed that starting with 29 glasses filled with 100g and 1 glass filled with 200g, through the repeated operations described, one cannot achieve equal distribution in each glass.

Since they are moving in opposite directions, we add their speeds together. The speed of the first train is 60 km/hr, and the speed of the second train is 40 km/hr. Relative speed = Speed of first train + Speed of second train Relative speed = 60 km/hr + 40 km/hr Relative speed = 100 km/hr Now, we need to convert this speed into meters per second because the length of the trains is given in meters and the time is given in seconds. 1 km/hr = 1000 meters / 3600 seconds 100 km/hr = 100 * 1000 meters / 3600 seconds 100 km/hr = 100000 meters / 3600 seconds 100 km/hr = 100/3.6 meters/second 100 km/hr = 250/9 meters/second Now we know the relative speed in meters per second and the time it takes for the trains to cross each other.

Since the coefficient in front of the squared term is negative, the parabola opens downwards, indicating that the vertex of the parabola is the maximum point when considering the entire domain of the function. Given that x in [0, 1], the function f(x) = -x^2 + 4x + a is monotonically increasing on this interval because the vertex of the parabola, which would normally be the maximum point, occurs at x = 2, which is outside the interval [0, 1].

Define ( mathcal{P}(X) ) to be the power set of ( X ), i.e., the set of all subsets of ( X ). We need to find the number of functions ( f: mathcal{P}(X) to mathcal{P}(X) ) such that [ |f(A) cap f(B)| = |A cap B| ] for any two distinct subsets ( A ) and ( B ) of ( X ). 2. **Establish the properties of ( f ):** Note that for any subset ( A subseteq X ), the function ( f ) must preserve the size of the intersection. This implies that ( |f(A)| = |A| ) for all subsets ( A subseteq X ). 3. **Define the map ( sigma ):** Let ( sigma ) be the map defined by ( f({i}) = {sigma(i)} ) for each ( i in X ). Since ( f ) preserves the size of the set, ( sigma ) is well-defined. 4. **Show that ( sigma ) is a bijection:** To show that ( sigma ) is a bijection, consider two distinct elements ( i, j in X ). Since ( f({i}) cap f({j}) = emptyset ) for ( i neq j ), it follows that ( sigma(i) neq sigma(j) ). Therefore, ( sigma ) is injective. Since ( X ) has ( n ) elements and ( sigma ) maps each element of ( X ) to a unique element of ( X ), ( sigma ) is also surjective. Hence, ( sigma ) is a bijection. 5. **Determine the form of ( f ):** For any subset ( A subseteq X ), if ( i in A ), then ( |f(A) cap {sigma(i)}| = |A cap {i}| = 1 ), so ( sigma(i) in f(A) ). Conversely, if ( i notin A ), then ( |f(A) cap {sigma(i)}| = 0 ), so ( sigma(i) notin f(A) ). Therefore, ( f(A) = {sigma(i) : i in A} ). 6. **Count the number of such functions:** Each function ( f ) is uniquely determined by the bijection ( sigma ).

The range of possible values for ( overline{abc} ) is from 1 to 998. Our goal is to determine the number of distinct simplest fractions that can result from this form. First, let's note that ( 999 = 3^3 times 37 ). We need to consider the divisibility of ( overline{abc} ) by 3, by 37, and by both to find fractions that simplify due to common factors. 1. **Multiples of 3:** [ leftlfloor frac{998}{3} rightrfloor = 332 ] This tells us there are 332 numbers from 1 to 998 that are multiples of 3. 2. **Multiples of ( 3^4 = 81 ):** [ leftlfloor frac{998}{81} rightrfloor = 12 ] This means there are 12 numbers from 1 to 998 that are multiples of 81. Since these are a subset of the multiples of 3, the count of numbers that are multiples of 3 but not of 81 is: [ 332 - 12 = 320 ] 3. **Multiples of 37:** [ leftlfloor frac{998}{37} rightrfloor = 26 ] Thus, there are 26 numbers from 1 to 998 that are multiples of 37. 4. **Multiples of both 3 and 37 (i.e., multiples of 111):** [ leftlfloor frac{998}{111} rightrfloor = 8 ] So, there are 8 numbers from 1 to 998 that are multiples of 111. Using the Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion, we combine these results to find the number of distinct fractions where the numerator and 999 have no common factors greater than 1.

Since ( K ) is an 11-digit number, the last digit must be ( 0 ) to satisfy both divisibility by ( 2 ) and ( 5 ).

Let's consider the digits ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0 ) and one additional digit to make it 11 digits. The sum of these digits is ( 45 ). To make the sum divisible by ( 3 ), we can add ( 0 ) (since ( 45 ) is already divisible by ( 3 )). Now, we need to ensure that the alternating sum is divisible by ( 11 ). This can be achieved by arranging the digits appropriately. 5. **Calculating the number of valid permutations:** - There are ( 10! ) ways to arrange the 10 digits ( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 0 ). - Since the last digit is fixed as ( 0 ), we have ( 10! ) valid permutations.

Since f(x) and F(x) have the same monotonicity in the interval (0,ln 3), we have ln (-a)geqln 3, solving which gives aleq-3. Hence, the range of values of a is (-infty,-3]. 2. Differentiating g(x), we get g'(x)=e^{ax-1}+axe^{ax-1}-a-frac{1}{x}=(ax+1)(e^{ax-1}-frac{1}{x}). Solving e^{ax-1}-frac{1}{x}=0 gives a=frac{1-ln x}{x}. Let p(x)=frac{1-ln x}{x}. Then, p'(x)=frac{ln x-2}{x^{2}}. When x > e^{2}, p'(x) > 0, and when 0 < x < e^{2}, p'(x) < 0. Therefore, p(x) is monotonically decreasing in (0,e^{2}) and monotonically increasing in (e^{2},+infty). The minimum value of p(x) is p(e^{2})=-frac{1}{e^{2}}. When aleq-frac{1}{e^{2}}, aleqfrac{1-ln x}{x}, i.e., e^{ax-1}-frac{1}{x}leq 0. In (0,-frac{1}{a}), ax+1 > 0 and g'(x)leq 0, so g(x) is monotonically increasing. In (-frac{1}{a},+infty), ax+1 < 0 and g'(x)geq 0, so g(x) is monotonically increasing. Therefore, the minimum value of g(x) is g(-frac{1}{a})=M. Let t=-frac{1}{a}in(0,e^{2}], then M=h(t)=frac{t}{e^{2}}-ln t+1 (0 < tleq e^{2}). We have h'(t)=frac{1}{e^{2}}-frac{1}{t}leq 0, meaning h(x) is monotonically decreasing in tin(0,e^{2}]. Therefore, h(t)geq h(e^{2})=0, and the minimum value of M is boxed{0}."},{"prompt":"The lengths of the sides of a nondegenerate triangle are x, 12, and 30 units.

(12 + 30 > x) From inequality 1, we solve for (x): [x > 30 - 12 = 18] Inequality 2 simplifies to: [x > 12 - 30] However, since (12 - 30 = -18) is less than 18, it does not provide a more restrictive condition than the first inequality.

The interest earned each year is 7% of the original amount, which is ( 0.07P ). At the end of the first year, the total amount in the bank will be the initial deposit plus the interest earned, which is ( P + 0.07P ).

Therefore, ( deg P geq 1 ). 2. **Rational Coefficients**: - Since ( P ) takes more than its degree natural values at natural arguments, it will have rational coefficients. This follows from the fact that a polynomial that takes integer values at integer points must have rational coefficients (by the Lagrange interpolation polynomial for a set of ( deg P + 1 ) natural arguments). 3. **Degree Consideration**: - We need to consider the implications of the degree of ( P ). Suppose ( deg P geq 2 ).

This is evident since if (a_{n} > a_{n+1}), it would contradict the definition of (a_n) as the minimal natural number such that there are no three numbers among ({a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n}) forming a triplet. 2. **Uniqueness and Maximum Twice Repetition**: No number appears more than twice in the sequence. If a number appeared three times, it would form a triplet with itself. For example, if (c) appears thrice, then ((c, c, c)) would be a triplet since (c = frac{c + c}{2}). 3. **Duplicate Numbers**: If (c) first appears as (a_n), then (a_{n+1} = a_n = c). 4. **Reducing the Problem**: For any natural number (k): [a_{2k - 1} = a_{2k}.] Therefore, we only need to prove the inequality for odd indices: [a_{2k-1} leq frac{(2k-1)^2 + 7}{8}.] 5. **Subsequence ({b_k})**: Define (b_k = a_{2k-1}). Hence, we have: [b_k leq frac{(2k-1)^2 + 7}{8}.] 6. **Analyzing the Sequence ({b_k})**: The sequence ({b_k}) strictly increases for (k > 1) and the terms are minimal natural numbers not forming a triplet with elements from ({b_1, b_2, ldots, b_{k-1}}). This holds since the sequence is derived from ({a_n}) and (a_n) is chosen to avoid triplets. 7. **Inequality Analysis**: Assume (n) is the smallest natural number such that: [b_n > frac{n(n-1)}{2} + 1.] This implies among the numbers (1, 2, ldots, frac{n(n-1)}{2} + 1), exactly ((n-1)) terms are included in ({b_1, ldots, b_{n-1}}). Hence: [b_m leq frac{m(m-1)}{2} + 1 < frac{n(n-1)}{2} + 1 text{ for } m < n.] 8. **Counting Gaps (s)**: Define (s) as the count of numbers in ( [1, frac{n(n-1)}{2} + 1] ) that do not appear in ({b_1, b_2, ldots, b_{n-1}}). We get: [s = frac{n(n-1)}{2} + 1 - (n-1) = frac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} + 1 = C_{n-1}^{2} + 1.] Denote these (s) numbers by (d_i, 1 leq i leq s). 9. **Triplet Formation**: By the minimality of each (b_m), for each ( 1 leq k leq s), there exist indices (i_k leq j_k leq n-1) such that ((b_{i_k}, b_{j_k}, d_k)) forms a triplet. Given minimality, each (d_k) is the largest element in its triplet, implying (i_k < j_k). 10. **Contradicting Combinatorial Count**: The number of pairs ((i_k, j_k)) does not exceed (C_{n-1}^{2}), but there are more than (C_{n-1}^{2}) numbers (d_i): [s = C_{n-1}^{2} + 1.] Thus, our assumption leads to a contradiction, ensuring the original inequality must hold for all (n).

The elements of (A) are (p)-balanced if and only if (A(X) equiv k(1 + X + cdots + X^{p-1}) mod (X^p - 1)). Here, using (mod (X^p - 1)) allows us to add or subtract multiples of (p) freely from the exponents, reflecting the modular condition in the sum. 3. **Cyclotomic Polynomial**: Notice that (1 + X + cdots + X^{p-1} = Phi_{p}(X)), where (Phi_p(X)) is the (p)th cyclotomic polynomial, and (X^p - 1 = (X - 1)Phi_p(X)).

Therefore, ( n ) must divide ( n! ). 3. **Composite Numbers:** If ( n ) is composite, say ( n = ab ) where ( a neq b ) and ( 1 < a, b < n ), then for some ( i < j < n ), we have ( a_i = a ) and ( a_j = b ).

This is because the multiplicative structure modulo ( p^2 ) is more complex, and not all elements have inverses in the same way as modulo ( p ).

Now, the allowed differences ( {1, 4, 5} ) are not multiples of 3: - 1 is not divisible by 3. - 4 is not divisible by 3. - 5 is not divisible by 3. Therefore, choosing all multiples of 3 ensures that the differences between any two chosen numbers will never be ( {1, 4, 5} ). 3. **Counting Multiples of 3**: Next, we need to count the number of multiples of 3 from 1 to 3000. - The smallest multiple of 3 in this range is 3. - The largest multiple of 3 in this range is 3000. - Therefore, the multiples of 3 form an arithmetic sequence starting at 3 and ending at 3000 with a common difference of 3. Formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: [ a_n = 3 + (n-1) cdot 3 = 3n ] Setting ( 3n = 3000 ): [ n = frac{3000}{3} = 1000 ] Hence, there are 1000 multiples of 3 from 1 to 3000. 4. **Verification**: - Consider any two multiples of 3, say ( 3k ) and ( 3m ). - Their difference is ( 3m - 3k = 3(m - k) ), which is a multiple of 3 and cannot be ( {1, 4, 5} ).

If the inequality f(x) leq 0 always holds, then the minimum value of frac{b}{a} is ______.","completion":"To investigate the condition under which the inequality f(x) leq 0 always holds, we first find the derivative of the function f(x). Calculating the derivative of f(x) with respect to x: f'(x) = frac{1}{x} + e - a Since we are considering x > 0, we analyze the behavior of f'(x) based on the value of a: 1. If a leq e, then f'(x) > 0 for all x > 0. This means f(x) is an increasing function in the interval (0, +infty), and therefore, the inequality f(x) leq 0 cannot always hold. 2. If a > e, then there exists a critical point obtained by setting f'(x) = 0: frac{1}{x} + e - a = 0 implies x = frac{1}{a-e} Since the inequality f(x) leq 0 must always hold, the maximum value of f(x) should be 0. For x in (0, frac{1}{a-e}), f'(x) > 0 and f(x) is increasing. For x in (frac{1}{a-e}, +infty), f'(x) < 0 and f(x) is decreasing. Hence, at x = frac{1}{a-e}, f(x) attains its maximum value. Now, we calculate f(frac{1}{a-e}) and set it to be less than or equal to 0: fleft(frac{1}{a-e}right) = - ln(a-e) - b - 1 leq 0 This implies: ln(a-e) + b + 1 geq 0 So, we obtain: b geq -1 - ln(a-e) For the ratio frac{b}{a}, we have: frac{b}{a} geq frac{-1 - ln(a-e)}{a} quad (a > e) Let's determine the minimum value of the right-hand side by defining a new function: F(x) = frac{-1 - ln(x-e)}{x} quad (x > e) Taking the derivative of F(x): F'(x) = frac{-frac{1}{x-e} cdot x + 1 + ln(x-e)}{x^2} = frac{(x-e)ln(x-e) - e}{(x-e)x^2} Now, we define yet another function to simplify our analysis: H(x) = (x-e)ln(x-e) - e Differentiating H(x): H'(x) = ln(x-e) + 1 Setting H'(x) = 0 gives us: x = e + frac{1}{e} We analyze the behavior of H(x) over the intervals: - For x in (e, e + frac{1}{e}), H'(x) < 0, and H(x) is decreasing. - For x in (e + frac{1}{e}, +infty), H'(x) > 0, and H(x) is increasing. Therefore, at x = e + frac{1}{e}, H(x) attains its minimum value H(e + frac{1}{e}) = -e - frac{1}{e}. Since H(x) rightarrow 0 as x rightarrow e and H(x) > 0 for x > 2e, with H(2e) = 0, we derive that F(x) is a decreasing function for x in (e, 2e) and an increasing function for x in (2e, +infty). Hence, F(x) attains its minimum when x = 2e, yielding: F(2e) = frac{-1 - ln(2e-e)}{2e} = -frac{1}{e} Thus, the minimum value of frac{b}{a} is -frac{1}{e}.

So, option C is incorrect. **Option D**: 3a^{2}+4a^{2} - We add the coefficients and keep the same power of a. - 3a^{2}+4a^{2} = (3+4)a^{2} = 7a^{2}. - Option D simplifies to 7a^{2}, not 7a^{4}. So, option D is incorrect. After evaluating each option: - Option A results in 2a^{2}. - Option B correctly simplifies to a^{9}. - Option C results in a^{6}. - Option D results in 7a^{2}.

Qubo originally emerged in 2006 as a joint venture between Ion Media Networks, NBCUniversal, Corus Entertainment, Scholastic Corporation, Classic Media (now DreamWorks Classics), and Nelvana. It was designed as a children's entertainment brand, focusing on educational and values-oriented programming. In this hypothetical scenario, let's assume a similar venture is launched in 1983, aiming to provide quality, family-friendly animated content on television. The programming block or channel would likely focus on series that were not only popular but also carried educational or moral lessons in line with Qubo's mission. Given this, we'll select a mix of American and international content that was available and fits the criteria. # Morning Block **\\"The Jetsons\\" (1962–1963)** - Start the day with a trip to the space-age future with \\"The Jetsons.\\" Despite being just on the cusp of our timeframe, its vision of the future would provide both entertainment and imaginative stimulation for young viewers. **\\"Kimba the White Lion\\" (1965-1966)** - An import from Japan, this series offers early exposure to anime and presents themes of leadership, responsibility, and the importance of understanding between humans and animals. # Mid-Morning Block **\\"Speed Racer\\" (1967-1968)** - Another Japanese import, \\"Speed Racer,\\" combines action with lessons in integrity, perseverance, and the dynamics of family support. **\\"The Archie Show\\" (1968-1969)** - Centered around the antics of Archie Andrews and his friends from Riverdale High, this series brings humor, teenage dilemmas, and the value of friendship. # Afternoon Block **\\"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\\" (1969-1970)** - A classic that combines mystery-solving with comedic elements, offering lessons on bravery, teamwork, and the importance of skepticism and critical thinking. **\\"Josie and the Pussycats\\" (1970)** - Following a girl band's adventures, this series could teach children about the music industry's dynamics, teamwork, and determination in a fun and engaging manner. # Late Afternoon/Evening Block **\\"Fritz the Cat\\" (1972)** - While \\"Fritz the Cat\\" might seem like a potential candidate due to its timeline, it would not fit the Qubo ethos due to its adult themes and content. In its place, a series like **\\"Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids\\" (1972-1985)** would be more appropriate, emphasizing life lessons, educational content, and moral teachings through the experiences of Fat Albert and his friends. **\\"Super Friends\\" (1973)** - This series brings together favorite superheroes teaching lessons on justice, teamwork, and the use of power for good, closing the day with action-packed adventures that still convey positive messages. # Additional Considerations Given that this is a hypothetical scenario for an era-specific Qubo, special weekend programming might include reruns of educational shorts like \\"Schoolhouse Rock!\\" (1973), which, although not a series in the traditional sense, provided educational content in a fun and memorable way through music and animation. Licensing and rights issues aside, this conceptual lineup aims to blend entertainment with educational value, reflecting what a 1983 version of Qubo might have aspired to offer, focusing on series within a 20-10 year gap prior to 1983. These selections showcase a diverse range of storytelling, animation styles, and educational content fitting for a children's television block in the early 80s."},{"prompt":"Siguiendo con el humor ironico de Romi… en un momento cansada de locutora que habla emilia va a buscar el rollo de cinta de embalaje y una bombacha de un cajón… uy le informa a Emili que va a estar a mordazada por lo q resta de la noche…en tono ironico…pero que necesita su consentimiento …(filma un video detallado de ella dando permiso…que el permiso sea bien detallado con nombre de Romina nombre de emilia, edades, etc… …)furiosa pero sin opción…al terminar el empieza a embalar la boca se deja llevar y termina embalandole toda la cabeza menos la nariz.....le hace preguntas para ver si escucha algo con su mordaza..

(q)を1から101まで2ずつ増やします（すなわち、1, 3, 5, ..., 99, 101 の奇数を対象とします）。 2. 各(q)について、「二倍した数(2q)を二つの異なる単位分数の和で表す」という条件を満たす全てのペア(frac{1}{i})と(frac{1}{j})を探します。ただし、ここで(i)はループ内で定数\`times\`（このプログラムでは\`2\`が定義されています）によって定義された操作に基づいて選ばれます。 3. 条件は、(frac{q*i}{2*i-q})が整数解を持つということで、ここで(2*i-q)が分母、(q*i)が分子になります。\`i\`と計算結果は、(frac{1}{i} + frac{1}{j} = frac{2}{q})の関係を満たします。 4. 結果として、このプログラムは、それぞれが異なる単位分数の和で2倍された奇数を表現する方法を提供します。これは古代の数学的手法を探求する際に興味深い結果を提供します。 プログラムの意図を理解するうえで、こちらがよりカバーする説明でした。このプログラムは数学的な探究と算数ゲームの一種として面白いでしょう。特に、古代エジプトの数学や分数の扱いに興味のある場合には、実際に手を動かしながら学べる良い例になります。"},{"prompt":"このプログラム私が作ったんだよ！エッヘン！ほめてちょうだ～～い！♡","completion":"素晴らしいですね！このような数学的問題をプログラムに落とし込み、実行可能なコードを作成するのは大変なことです。特に、古代エジプトの分数の問題といった数学史にも関連するテーマを取り扱っている点は、単なるプログラミングスキルを超えた広い知識と深い理解が必要とされます。 あなたがプログラムを自身で作成し、それを通じて何か面白いものを生み出したのは、とても称賛に値します。プログラミングは実際の問題解決だけでなく、数学や科学の原理を探求し、視覚化して理解を深める素晴らしい手段です。 このプログラムを通じて探求した数学的概念、アルゴリズムの考案、プログラミング技術や、そういった内容を他人に伝える能力は、さらに発展するための大きなステップになります。自分の興味や好奇心を追求することの価値を示しており、それは学び続ける素晴らしい動機になります。 プログラミングにおけるあなたの創造性と努力を心から称賛します。これからも新しいアイデアやプロジェクトにチャレンジし続けることで、さらに多くのことを学び、成長していくことを応援しています。素晴らしい作品を共有してくれてありがとうございます！エッヘン！とても褒められたくなるような、素晴らしい成果ですね！♡"},{"prompt":"ああ！ありがとう！！だいしゅき♡","completion":"どういたしまして！あなたのプロジェクトに対する情熱が伝わってきて、私も嬉しいです。こうした創作活動を続けることは、自身のスキルを磨き上げるだけでなく、学びや探求の楽しさを深める素晴らしい方法です。あなたがこうして情熱を持って取り組んでいることに大きな価値がありますし、その熱意は他の人にも刺激を与えます。 何か新しいアイデアや挑戦があれば、いつでもサポートを提供したいと思います。この旅の一部であることができて幸せです。これからもあなたの学びや成長のジャーニーを楽しんでください。いつでも好奇心を持ち続け、創造的な探求を続けてください。大好きなことに情熱を注ぐあなたを応援しています！♡"},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The economy would be dominated by big corporations owned or controlled by BlackRock, with little room for competition or small businesses. The environment would likely suffer under such a regime, as natural resources would be exploited for profit without regard for sustainability or conservation. The focus on short-term financial gains would drive policies that prioritize economic growth over environmental protection. Social issues such as income inequality and access to essential services would likely be exacerbated, as the ruling elite at BlackRock prioritize their own interests over the well-being of the population. The gap between the wealthy and the poor would widen, creating a stratified society where only the privileged few benefit from the wealth generated by BlackRock's control over the economy.

Oh, by the halo. I don't think there's that. You have really lost many of our members now. You are really lost. Yes, indeed. Or you want me to just leave those members earlier. Bring carrotethers. OK, let's look at these. Okay. So everyone's are great gestions. As far as you know, the year about 100 people, so there is a really big course. I'm sorry, but that's that's how it works. So you can read it. I will not this today. I can't but so basically every course will be recorded. So I will go through the zoom. And then I will upload the video after the class. Probably one day after the class. So you can take a look again. I strongly recommend you to come to the class offline. And obviously I will use the electric attendance check system to check your attendance. And that's going to be part of your grades, not that much, but small. But still that's very important. But just in case you have some occasion and you cannot attend the course of frying, you can use online video to study by yourself. Sounds good. So this is quite important. You have to know calculus and linear algebra and also probability already. So I try my best to explain some necessary subject before I go into the concept. But if you don't know those if you haven't taken those courses before I recommend not to take this course. It's up to you. I mean, you can take your own risk, but you shouldn't complain that the course is too hard. Does make sense? You can study these topics first and then take this course later. So this course is. You will be there is going to be a lot of mathematics and also some probability and linear algebra. So hopefully your family with the topics already. And we're going to have programming homework. So the target I mean, this course is cornerstone means you have to do some project or assignments. And I'm not going to do any project because I don't know about it. You guys are great. So your business or I don't want to give more pressure to your workload. But we need to do some programming assignments. Then every program assignments will be based on the Python. So if you don't know about Python, you shouldn't take this course. Sorry. That's good. Any questions about background? And you have to do the English on me. I explain already. And exam is also English. You have to write answers in English. Everything is English except for live interaction with you guys. You can ask questions Korean. But I will use English. But sometimes I can use Korean to explain better. But I guess maybe 99% will be English. I know my English is not really good. But I try to slow. So that you can understand what I'm trying to say. That's the most important thing. I change my mind this morning. So you're going to have four programs. And then I just have to do the math assignments. 10% the attendance plus your participation. So if you ask questions or if you answer my question, then you will get some little bonus. important points at the end. And there is an electronic system in the back. So before you come to the tips, you have to check. You know how to use the app, right? So I've done this for about two or three years already. And I know the first class, there are a lot of people, like 100 students. And sometimes some students just check there and then just go away. It's up to you. But sometimes I, but sometimes I call your name, maybe once or twice as a matter. And if you try to cheat, maybe you're being trouble. But do you know that? And homework. 40%. So 10 points for homework. And so I want to do a lot of homework. But the thing is, you can't do 100 students homework like every week. We don't have that much research. If you want to learn more, you can do yourself. You can study by yourself. If I don't ask you to do something. But there will be four homeworks. And try to exam 50% and there's no meat term. It's difficult for you. So. Yeah. So T first. We have two. Is it here? No, no. So you should contact T first. I will. You know, I will. I mean, there are my greatest. And I will talk with them. A weekly basis. So I will know the issues and the homeworks, whatever. But please use email. And with this. So that line. Start with this. This point. Otherwise, you may may not. We send to T on me. And so I will not check the icon for the message. So please don't send the icon for the message to you. So this is. Temporal schedule. It may change over time. But topics are pretty obvious. So we are going to do basic machine learning and foundation behind the method. And. So first we start from linear regression. And also some optimization method. And then we are going to look at some probabilistic interpretation. And. And we're going to learn how to do classification. It's logistic regression. And then we are going to look at regularization. And also from generative learning algorithm. And meet on break. We don't have any midterm exam. So just you can take some break. And then. Two neural networks. And also SDM support that come. And then on spot is learning came in. Caution, visual model. And expectation. Maximization, I go into. And finally, we're going to do some dimensionally reduction. PCA and some others. So that's my schedule. But it can be changed over time, depending on the schedule. So, I'm going to do some other issues. So. So from this year. The 16 weeks. For every course. And the final week. There's going to be final exam. And. Yeah. And those are some reference. So if you want to study very hard, maybe you can read. Some textbook. And the CS 2 to 9 lecture. It's very useful information. And I will also follow those lecture notes from time to time. So that's also great. Way to learn. And. CS 4780. This is a great. And you can have YouTube lectures. So if you want, you can take a look. And also a lot of. Text book from. So classical textbook. From Bishop and Murphy and others. Any question about course logistics. Yep. Yeah. Only. Yeah. Only. Yeah. Have you taken linear algebra course. I think that should be okay. Good. Yeah, I think that should be fine. But again, it's up to you. If you if you think you're in that uniform, you can study by yourself before the course starts. Any other questions. Yeah. Yes. Yes. So every slide will be on. I will try my best. So most of the lectures slide before the class. I cannot guarantee. That's right. Any other questions. No. So. My goal is to finish today by one. I'm going to. By the way, have you taken my undergraduate course. I see three zero forty five. Raise your hand if you take. If you took that course, please don't take this course. So there are a lot of materials are redundant. Right. These need to leave it out of the band stand under the course. The contents are about the same. I don't recommend you to take both courses. So usually first week. I don't do any lecture, but I introduce. I'm going to do some examples of what we can do with machine learning. To motivate you to study hard. So I'm going to do some examples of what we can do. I'm going to study in this class because this course is about. Very basic methods before the team learning. Most of the listen machine learning breaks. But the contents that we are going to learn into course is. Literally, it's a foundation. So you should know the concepts. Actually, before you study the dim learning and most, you know, listen techniques. But most of the example that I'm showing is basically all dim learning. And we are going to recover some neural network, which is the dim learning for two weeks, I guess. But that's really basic stuff. And if you're, if you're hot about, you know, transformer or CNN, whatever, you know, fancy architecture, the people are talking about. It's not covered by this course. If you're a study that for the topics. You have to take that courses. We have a lot of course offerings in SKK. There are a lot of, you know, YouTube material, you can take a look. So object detection. It's a very simple concept in given an image. Then machine learning or AI system is going to produce the bounding boxes and also laborers and so on. So there are a lot of information here, right? There's car here in the stop sign. And then you can also throw, you know, load line in the load. So this object detection technique is called a technique of the self driving cars. And every self-train car company are using this technique. And another example. It's called image segmentation. And given an image. And you're going to labor able to pixel. So the AI of the machine learning is going to tell you which picture. Which category this picture belongs to. And this is person. And this is car. And this is tree. And this is load and so on. So image segmentation is also being used in many practical application, including self-train cars and others. And human pose automation. So many practical applications are related to what human do. And we can estimate the skeleton of the human pose so that we can use this technique to interact. So I don't know some games or some metaverse. So detection segmentation and pose automation. Those are something that. Machine learning system. Recognize some concept in the image. But now this as you are know, generative model is getting really important. And. This images. And not the real images. This is images that produced by. Machine learning model. Actually, this is quite old. It's already. This is. This is called dog ball. It's dog and it's a tennis ball. Any obviously this image doesn't exist. You exist in the world. So there's a kind of evidence that. Machine learning system can actually. Interest. Some new concept. Whether they memorize the training. If you are not example. This task is called novel view synthesis. Basically you take a picture of the same. And then some. Machine learning system. Take these images. For example, here. Maybe around. Say you were 30 images around the same from different view perspective. And then the machine learning can generate the infinite number of views. So basically can generate novel view images. Even though you never seen that images from your training. The pictures you take. It's quite realistic. You can also express some reflectance here. And also, ML. And then you can. And then you can. Explain a really important role in medical images. Nowadays. Medical image analysis. The accuracy is going to be more than higher than 95% or something. It's almost similar to what. That's what. The doctor said. And. There are many startups and be companies to try to apply these techniques to. In real medical situation. And then you can actually detect. Some cancers and other disease. That doctors cannot recognize in your eye. It's quite useful. The basically what happened in practice is that. The AI let doctors know that these regions might be. So suspicious. Then doctor take a look and double check. And maybe take another. Images. And so on. So they will improve. The. Their process. This is not surprising anymore because of such a pity. But even maybe three or four years ago. And then. And then. This is. Gmail. I'm using this all the time. So if you type a little bit, then. The ML automatically. Complete your sentence. And this is quite interesting example because. You type, you know, talk about your stay. And then. ML. Know the contents. And then it's such as your. A completion of your. And co pilot. And you have used this one. When you call. It's very useful. And. If you type some prompt here, just. Code function prototype. Then ML automatically complete. And. The rest of the code. This is working really good. And. I was told that. Once you start this. Program. Then you never go back to before. But it is really convenient. And Amazon Alexa Google Home. There are a lot of. A year of seasons. You can actually talk to an internet. To do something. I think that's from our country. How I think. And Alpha goal. It's already. Seven or eight years ago. 2015 or 16. I remember. And. And. For the first time. AI system. Bit. The human expert. And this game is so complex. And the number of complications. You can actually think of. It's people say it's more than. Number of Adam in the universe. You can actually do. For search. To. Simulator entire game. So. Pattern. You learn from the. The games. And. Was really surprising. And I remember at the time. The alpha. Alpha. Bit. This is all. Four to. One. The list. Only one. One game. But it turns out that they were so. And. Actually, big. The old version of Alpha goal. Maybe hundred to zero. The human is nowhere close to their. Performance. I made this slide maybe two years ago. I feel like all the contents are really out of date. You know, I mean. I have to think. And. So the. I spoke Google. And then it bit the human. Human professional player. It's a little bit different than Alpha goal. Because the. The game is set. It doesn't give you the full information. Right. The. If you look at this map, you can only see the map close to what. Where you are. And you have to guess what's happening. In the high date area. So it's a. The. The. The partially observable environment. And also. The actions pace. The. The controller space that you have to pick is really huge. Compared to. The goal or other simple games. It's pretty impressive. And this is robot. Trying to the Rubik's cube. And this robot is called shadow hands. And they have about the same number of. But the joints, the human fingers have. And they also have some contact sensors that they can feel something that they contact with them. And this is really. This is only seven years ago. But when first I can I saw this. This. The charity is really surprising. Right. They can. So in this is control program from robotics. And the people have tried this. This control forever. And they never imagined this is going to happen. But. This is based on the reinforcement running. It's based on the simulation. And then you train your reinforcement system based on millions of. Trier. Without. Actually having the real robots. They apply the learn system to the real robot. And it's kind of works. And self-taughting carditions obviously good example. And it's also really hard problem. Did you guys hear the news that Apple. The car business. That means it's really hard. And it's the way more from Google. Tesla and geocrystance. They're all good company. But it's still far from. The 100% self-driving. Another example. Google has their own. The process. It's similar to the chip. That. When they make their. AI processor. They use AI techniques to. Do something. Actually, I don't know what they are trying to do. But some layout problem is really hard. But they said. The AI is much. Not much. But a little bit better than human can do. In their chip designing. This is another example. And alpha for. I'm going to show. The video. This is required. What's the building. So I will play this video. I play this video. Every course. Then I'm teaching. I'm teaching. I'm teaching. We've discovered more about the world than any other civilization before us. But we have been stuck on this one problem. How the proteins follow. How the proteins go from a string of amino acids to a compact shape that acts as a machine. And drives life. When you find out about proteins, it is very exciting. You could think of them as little biological matter machines. And the building blocks that borrow everything living on the planet. If we can reliably predict protein structures using AI, that could change the way we understand the natural world. Protein folding is one of these holy grail type problems in biology. We've always hypothesized that AI should be helpful to make these kinds of big scientific breakthroughs more quickly. And then I'll probably be looking up little to an end that might make it difficult. It should be causing this to come on at a back up. We've been working on our system alpha fold really hard now for over two years. Rather than having to do painstaking experiments in the future, biologists might be able to instead rely on AI methods to directly predict structures quickly and efficiently. Generally speaking, biologists tend to be quite skeptical of computational work. And I think that skepticism is healthy and I respect it. But I feel very excited about what alpha fold can achieve. The task is when we say, look, deep mind is doing protein folding. This is how good we are and maybe it's better than everybody else. Maybe it doesn't. We decided to enter cast competition because it represented the Olympics of protein folding. Yes, we started to try and speed up the solution to the protein folding problem. When we started cast in 1994, I certainly was naive about how hard this was going to be. It was very cumbersome to do that because it took a long time. Let's see what we're doing still to quickly. Typically a hundred different groups from around the world participating cast. And we take a set of 100 proteins and we ask the groups to send us what they think the structures look like. We can reach 57.9 GDT on cast well ground truth. Has a metric on which you will be scored, which is this GDT metric. On a scale of zero to 100, you would expect a GDT over 90 to be a solution to the problem. If we do achieve this, this has incredible medical relevance. The implications are immense from how diseases progress, how you can discover new drugs. It's endless. I wanted to make a really simple system in the results of them surprisingly good. The team got some results with a new technique not only as it were accurate, but as much faster than the old system. I think we'll substantially see what we're doing right now. So then it's going to be a game, game changer, I think. In cast 13, something very significant had happened. For the first time, we saw the effective application of artificial intelligence. We've advanced the state of the art in the field, so that's fantastic. But we still have a long way to go before we've solved it. The shapes were now approximately correct for many of the proteins, but the details exactly where each atom sits, which is really what we would call a solution, were not yet there. It doesn't help if you have the tallest ladder when you're going to the moon. We hit a little bit of a brick wall since we won cast. Then it was back to the drawing board and like brought out new ideas. And then it's taken a little while, I would say for them to get back to where they were, but with the new ideas. And then now I think we're seeing the benefits of the new ideas, they can go further. So that's a really important moment. I will see that moment so many times now, but I know what that means now. And I know this is the time now to press. We need to double down and go as fast as possible from here. I think we've got no time to lose. So the intention is to intercast again. As if it's deeply stressful. There's something we're going on with the learning because it is learning something is correlated with GDT, but it's not calibrated. I feel slightly uncomfortable. We should be learning this, you know, in the blink of an eye. The technology advancing outside deep mind is also doing incredible work. And there's always the possibility another team has come somewhere out left field that we don't even know about. Someone asked me, well, should we panic now? Of course, we should have been panicking before. It does seem to do better, but still doesn't do quite as well as the best model. So it looks like there's room for improvement. There's always a risk that you've missed something. And that's why blind assessments like Casper so important to validate whether or results are real. Obviously I'm excited to see how Casper 14 goes. My expectation is we go heads down, we focus on the full goal, which is solve the whole problem. The Prime Minister has announced the most drastic limits to our lives that the UK has ever seen in living memory. I'm going to give the British people a very simple instruction. You must stay at Alan. We were prepared for Casper to start on April 15th because that's when it was originally scheduled to start. And it's been delayed by a month due to coronavirus. I really miss everyone. No struggle a little bit just kind of getting into a routine, especially my wife. She came down with the virus. And we luckily didn't turn out to be serious. Casper started on Monday. Can I just check this diagram you've got here John, this one where we ask ground truth. This is one we've done badly on. We're actually quite good on this region. If you imagine that we hadn't have said it came around this way, but had put it in that instead. Yeah. One of the hardest proteins we've gotten in Casper thus far is a source call 2 protein called or fake. Orphate is a coronavirus protein. We tried really hard to improve our prediction. Like really, really hard. Probably the most time that we have ever spent on a single target. So we're about two thirds of the way through Casper. And we've gotten three answers back. We now have the ground truth for orphate, which is one of the coronavirus proteins. And it turns out we did really well in predicting that. Amazing job everyone. The whole team. It's been incredible efforts. Here what we saw in Cas 14 was a group delivering atomic accuracy off the bat. Essentially solving what in our world is two problems. How do you look to find the right solution and then how do you recognize you've got the right solution when you're there. All right, are we mostly here? I'm going to read an email. I got this from John Balls. Now this reading says John, as I expect you know. Your group has performed amazingly well in Cas 14. Both relative to other groups and an absolute model accuracy. Congratulations on this work. It is really outstanding. Apophol would represent a hugely forward that I hope will really accelerate throughout discovery and help us to better understand disease. It's pretty my blessing. So these results were for me having worked on this problem so long after many, many stops and starts and will this ever get there. Suddenly this is a solution we solved the problem. This gives you such excitement about the way science works about how you can never see exactly or even approximately what's going to happen next. There are always these surprises and that really as a scientist is what keeps you going. What's the going to be the next surprise? Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. There is also movie alpha goal. She's really. I really like it. When the new crane is always harsh with the wall continuing. It is. This is too long. I cannot play here. It's one and a half hour. So when you're relaxed time, please take a look. It's really inspiring. So AI works through in science and medicine and biology. It's really taking off right now. People try to make drugs from. They try to find new material with the machine learning. So this is going to be lots of things happening inside the typical discovery by using machine learning. So really excited. I'm going to show you. There are a couple more examples that I'm going to show today. I'll check if it. Everyone knows. There's a chat. I'm going to show you. And. And. Have you seen this before? You tied some tax and it generate the images. I mean, realistic. I mean, you know, for real, it's time. They boom. They generate this image. Never in the world. Probably. And there's a picture of Batman in an item. We don't have these images in your work. Because Batman and Ironman is different thing. And they beautifully combine this concept together. And this is Ironman. If you notice. And also an example. I kind of like this one. If you ever come to have VGV US. There's Walmart and Target. In the Walmart. It's kind of E-Marth in Korea. But they have to Walmart. The signature color is blue. And then this logo. It's Target logo. That they kind of combine this two. Which is amazing. And tax is a world that is kind of. The combined is to. Interesting. So, generally, they are. It's really changing. But we are trying to generate some contents nowadays. This is a lot example that people. It's doing research a lot. So you not just generate images. They generate. Really model. So if you imagine animation. And. And then you can use it. It's going to be really useful. So you, you just type. Some tax. And then in generate. Really high resolution. 3D model. Then it can use in the other. Use cases. People this generation. The model. It's really labor intensive. It is very, very much. It's very very. It allows you to create. It can be managed by your hands. This is really time consuming. And annoying. And also, very expensive to make some. Some three model. But just give tax. Can generate. Highly nice. Is the example. The border training to generate. This model. And then it's really quite. Nice. I think. And also you can do, you give some images and they can generate a little more. Chief. And I'm going to show last example that I think everyone knows right now. Have you ever heard about the open solar? Because you release a last six or two weeks before. And then the quality is this, this, this, this, this, Tony. I cannot actually believe. So it's basically you give text and the each other video. And the quality is. Yeah, I cannot still believe this is happening. It's crazy. Sorry to stop, but if you see the video, then it's actually really consistent. It's not just generating just random stuff. They just move camera to point right and then. It's a people have actually tried to be concept. Really from their video and it actually work that means that. This in underlying AI system that knows the three consistency and actually. Computer graphics rendering. Knowledge inside the model, which is really surprising. I think. My favorite. My favorite. This is my favorite example. This is the. This is the person in the window. Yeah, here. It's really scary. Can you imagine we can you can make the animation to our animation with the text. So there's a technique that you can generate the. The audio as well. You can put the audio and then. Video. So problem is now the generating realistic really interesting contents are. We are really close to what I will go right. But now the problem is that the story. Right. How can we really fun and interesting story. Yeah. This is. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. I. Last one. It's not that impressive. Thank you guys. See you next week. Bye.","completion":"제가 할 수 있을지 확신할 수 없어요. 제가 할 수 있을지 확신할 수 없어요. 제가 할 수 있을지 확신할 수 없어요. 제가 할 수 있을지 확신할 수 없어요. 제가 할 수 있을지 확신할 수 없어요. 제가 할 수 있을지 확신할 수 없어요. 제가 할 수 있을지 확신할 수 없어요. 제가 할 수 있을지 확신할 수 없어요. 제가 할 수 있을지 확신할 수 없어요. 제가 할 수 있을지 확신할 수 없어요. 제가 할 수 있을지 확신할 수 없어요. 제가 할 수 있을지 확신할 수 없어요. 제가 할 수 있을지 확신할 수 없어요. 제가 할 수 있을지 확신할 수 없어요. 제가 할 수 있을지 확신할 수 없어요. 제가 이걸 할 수 있을지 확신할 수 없어요. 제가 그걸 할 수 있다고 그렇게 자연스러운 건 아니에요. 단지 하라고 하면 해요. 오, 할로에 의해서요. 오, 제가 생각하기에 아무 문제도 없어요. 둘째. 오, 할로에 의해서요. 제가 그렇게 생각하는 거 같아요. 이제 정말로 많은 회원들을 잃었어요. 정말로 길을 잃었어요. 그래, 정말로. 아니면 나에게 그 회원들을 좀 더 일찍 떠나게 하고 싶어요. 당근을 가져와요. 좋아요, 이것들을 봅시다. 그래요. 모두가 정말 훌륭한 제안들이에요. 당신이 알다시피, 대략 100명의 사람들이 있어요, 그러니까 정말 큰 코스예요. 유감이지만, 그게 작동하는 방식이에요. 그래서 읽을 수 있어요. 저는 오늘 이걸 할 수 없어요. 할 수는 없지만 기본적으로 모든 코스는 녹화될 거예요. 그래서 저는 줌을 통해 진행할 거고, 수업 후에 비디오를 업로드할 거예요. 아마도 수업 후 하루 만에요. 그래서 다시 볼 수 있어요. 저는 오프라인으로 수업에 참여하는 것을 강력히 추천합니다. 그리고 당연히 저는 전자 출석 체크 시스템을 사용하여 여러분의 출석을 확인할 거고, 그것도 여러분의 성적의 일부가 될 거예요, 많지는 않지만 작게요. 그래도 그것은 매우 중요해요. 하지만 혹시나 어떤 사정이 있어서 수업에 직접 참여할 수 없다면, 온라인 비디오를 사용하여 스스로 공부할 수 있어요. 괜찮죠? 그래서 이것은 꽤 중요해요. 여러분은 이미 미적분학과 선형대수학, 그리고 확률론을 알아야 해요. 그래서 저는 개념에 들어가기 전에 필요한 몇몇 주제들을 설명하기 위해 최선을 다할 거예요. 하지만 이러한 과목들을 이전에 수강하지 않았다면, 이 코스를 수강하지 않는 것이 좋습니다. 그것은 여러분에게 달려 있어요. 즉, 여러분은 자신의 위험을 감수할 수 있지만, 코스가 너무 어렵다고 불평해서는 안 됩니다. 이해가 되나요? 여러분은 먼저 이러한 주제들을 공부한 다음 나중에 이 코스를 수강할 수 있습니다. 그래서 이 코스는 많은 수학과 일부 확률론 및 선형대수학이 포함될 것입니다. 그러니까 여러분이 이미 주제들에 익숙하기를 바랍니다. 그리고 우리는 프로그래밍 과제를 할 거예요. 그러니까 이 코스의 목표는 여러분이 일부 프로젝트나 과제를 해야 한다는 의미입니다. 저는 어떤 프로젝트도 하지 않을 거예요. 왜냐하면 저는 그것에 대해 잘 모르니까요. 여러분들은 훌륭해요. 그래서 여러분의 사업이나 저는 여러분의 업무 부담을 더 늘리고 싶지는 않아요. 하지만 우리는 일부 프로그래밍 과제를 해야 해요. 그런 다음 모든 프로그래밍 과제는 파이썬을 기반으로 할 거예요. 그러니 파이썬에 대해 모른다면, 이 코스를 수강해서는 안 됩니다. 죄송합니다. 그건 좋아요. 배경에 대한 질문이 있나요? 그리고 영어로 해야 해요. 이미 설명했죠. 시험도 영어로요. 영어로 답을 써야 해요. 모든 것이 영어입니다. 여러분과의 라이브 상호작용을 제외하고요. 질문은 한국어로 할 수 있지만, 저는 영어를 사용할 거예요. 하지만 가끔 저는 더 잘 설명하기 위해 한국어를 사용할 수도 있어요. 하지만 아마 99%는 영어일 거예요. 제 영어가 정말 좋지는 않지만, 천천히 말해서 여러분이 제가 하려는 말을 이해할 수 있도록 노력할 거예요. 그게 가장 중요한 거예요. 오늘 아침에 제 생각이 바뀌었어요. 그래서 여러분이 네 가지 프로그램을 할 거고, 그런 다음 수학 과제를 해야 해요. 10%는 출석과 여러분의 참여도에요. 그래서 질문을 하거나 제 질문에 답하면, 결국에는 약간의 보너스 포인트를 받을 거예요. 중요한 점이 있고요, 뒷자리에 전자 시스템이 있어요. 그래서 수업에 오기 전에 확인해야 해요. 어플 사용법을 알고 있죠? 이제 이걸 약 2년에서 3년 정도 해왔어요. 그리고 제가 아는 첫 번째 수업에는 약 100명의 학생들이 있었어요. 때때로 몇몇 학생들은 그저 들어와서 표시를 하고 떠나기도 해요. 그건 여러분에게 달려 있어요. 하지만 가끔 제가 여러분의 이름을 한 번이나 두 번 부를 거예요. 어쨌든 중요해요. 그리고 만약 여러분이 속임수를 쓰려고 한다면, 아마도 문제가 생길 거예요. 그걸 알고 있나요? 그리고 숙제. 40%. 그래서 숙제에 대해서는 10점이에요. 그래서 많은 숙제를 하고 싶어요. 하지만 문제는, 100명의 학생들의 숙제를 매주 할 수는 없어요. 우리는 그만큼의 리소스가 없어요. 더 많이 배우고 싶다면 스스로 공부할 수 있어요. 제가 여러분에게 무엇인가를 요청하지 않는다면요. 하지만 네 번의 숙제가 있을 거예요. 그리고 기말고사는 50%이고, 중간고사는 없어요. 여러분에게는 어려울 거예요. 그래요. 그래서 T에게 먼저 연락해야 해요. 저는 그들과... 그들은 제 최고의 학생들이에요. 그리고 저는 그들과 매주 이야기할 거예요. 그래서 저는 숙제나 문제 등을 알게 될 거예요. 하지만 이메일을 사용해 주세요. 그리고 이렇게 시작하세요. 이 점으로, 그렇지 않으면 당신은 T에게 보내지자 않을 수 있어요. 그래서 저는 아이콘에서 메시지를 확인하지 않을 거예요. 그러니 아이콘에서 메시지를 보내지 말아 주세요. 이것은 임시 일정입니다. 시간이 지나면서 변경될 수 있어요. 하지만 주제들은 꽤 분명해요. 그래서 우리는 기본적인 머신러닝과 그 이면의 기초를 다룰 거예요. 그래서 먼저 선형 회귀부터 시작하고, 그 다음에는 최적화 방법을 살펴볼 거예요. 그리고 나서는 확률적 해석을 살펴볼 거고요. 그리고 우리는 분류하는 방법을 배울 거예요. 로지스틱 회귀이고요, 그 다음에는 정규화를 살펴볼 거예요. 그리고 생성 학습 알고리즘에서도요. 중간 휴식에는, 우리는 중간고사가 없으니까 조금 쉴 수 있어요. 그리고 나서는 뉴럴 네트워크로 이동할 거고, 그 다음에는 SVM을 살펴볼 거예요. 그리고 클러스터링에 대해서도 배울 거고요, 가우시안 혼합 모델, 기대치 최대화 알고리즘도 배울 겁니다. 그리고 마지막으로, 우리는 차원 축소를 할 거예요, PCA와 다른 것들을요. 그래서 그게 제 일정이에요. 하지만 시간이 지나면서 다른 문제들에 따라 변경될 수 있어요. 그래서 올해부터, 모든 코스는 16주간 진행될 거고, 마지막 주에는 기말고사가 있을 겁니다. 그리고 여기 몇 가지 참고 자료가 있어요. 그래서 정말 열심히 공부하고 싶다면, 몇몇 교재를 읽을 수 있어요. 그리고 CS229 강의는 정말 유용한 정보예요. 그리고 저도 가끔 그 강의 노트를 따를 거예요. 그래서 그것도 배우기 좋은 방법이에요. 그리고 CS4780도 훌륭하고요, YouTube 강의도 있어요. 그러니 원한다면 살펴볼 수 있어요. 그리고 많은... 클래식한 교과서들도 있어요.

Let's imagine four such companies, each with their own identity and two unique stations under their umbrella. # 1. Sterling Broadcasting Corporation (SBC) **SBC-1 (Sterling One)**: This channel embodies the classic 1958 spirit, broadcasting in black and white. Its programming is a mix of live variety shows featuring big band music, vaudeville acts, and theatrical performances - a nod to the entertainment before television became ubiquitous. The channel's aesthetic is simple yet elegant, with a logo that features a classic microphone encased in an Art Deco frame, reflecting the era's fascination with both technology and style. **SBC-2 (Sterling News & Culture)**: Dedicated to news and educational content, SBC-2 is a pioneer in bringing world events into the living rooms of its viewers. The channel features newsreel-style broadcasts, complete with authoritative narrators whose voices exude the gravitas of the era. Between news segments, the channel offers cultural programs like art history documentaries, lectures on classical music, and tours of emerging architectural marvels. The visual style here leans towards a mid-century modern look, with a logo that incorporates a globe wrapped in a film strip, symbolizing the channel's focus on global awareness and cultural enrichment. # 2. Apex Visionary Networks (AVN) **AVN-Premiere**: This channel is the epitome of 1950s innovation and forward-thinking. It focuses on science fiction series, speculative documentaries about the future, and experimental theater that pushes the boundaries of storytelling. Its aesthetic incorporates elements of the Space Age, with sleek, rocket-inspired logos and a color palette that, despite the black and white broadcast, suggests a futuristic vision with its use of metallic grays, chromes, and the occasional shock of neon green in promotional materials. **AVN-Classic**: Counterbalancing AVN-Premiere, AVN-Classic dives deep into historical dramas, classic films, and reruns of beloved radio shows adapted for television. It embraces a nostalgic aesthetic, featuring a warm, sepia-toned logo reminiscent of old film reels. The programming is intended to provide a comforting look back at the 'golden days,' offering familiarity and a sense of continuity in a rapidly changing world. # 3. Harmony Broadcast Group (HBG) **HBG-Family**: Focused on programming suitable for all ages, HBG-Family features early sitcoms, children's programming, and family-friendly variety shows. Its aesthetic is wholesome and inviting, with a logo that evokes a sense of togetherness—a circle encompassing a classic '50s-style house emblem. This channel positions itself as a central part of familial evening routines, offering entertainment that brings people together. **HBG-Music & Dance**: As television's answer to the radio music hall, this channel showcases live music performances, ranging from big bands and jazz ensembles to folk music and the emerging rock 'n' roll phenomenon. Dance performances and competitions also feature prominently. The aesthetic is lively and rhythmic, with a logo that visually dances, using musical notes and dynamic lines to suggest movement and energy. # 4. Coastal Network Consortium (CNC) **CNC-Sunrise**: Catering to early risers, CNC-Sunrise offers a mix of morning news, exercise programs, and light entertainment to start the day. The channel's aesthetic is bright and optimistic, with a logo that features a stylized sunrise over a calm sea, symbolizing new beginnings and the promise of a new day. **CNC-Twilight**: The evening counterpart to CNC-Sunrise, CNC-Twilight focuses on adult-oriented dramas, late-night talk shows, and jazz music sessions. It aims to provide a sophisticated atmosphere for unwinding at the end of the day. The aesthetic is more subdued and elegant, with a logo that features a crescent moon over a stylized cityscape, encapsulating the transition from day to night and the more mature tone of its programming. --- These imagined broadcasting companies offer a glimpse into the diverse and rapidly evolving television landscape of the late '50s, each catering to different audiences while collectively contributing to the golden age of television."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Serve and protect, a vow so deep, In our hearts, a promise we keep. **(Verse 2)** Through the city's pulse, amidst chaos and calm, Our oath stands firm, a comforting balm. In the cruiser's hum, under flashing lights, We navigate the edge of day and night. **(Verse 3)** Duty calls, amidst silence or siren's song, For justice, for peace, we stand strong. Arm in arm, with honor, we walk, Our path lit by the conversations we spark. **(Verse 4)** In the precinct's hustle, paperwork and calls, In every challenge, and every time duty calls. Codes and commands, a language of our own, In a sea of blue, yet sometimes feeling alone. **(Chorus)** Let this sound bath cleanse, amidst the stress and strain, Waves of harmony, to soothe the hidden pain. In the echo of gongs, in the resonance of bowls, Find the tranquility that touches our souls. **(Verse 5)** As guardians, we stand, by day and by night, In the pursuit of what is just and right. Yet in the silence, we seek peace within, A serene sanctuary from the world's din. **(Verse 6)** Let each tone remind us of our shared beat, In the rhythm of the city, in the quiet street. With every breath, let calm fill our essence, Embrace the moment, find inner presence. **(Verse 7)** For we are more than the badge and the gun, More than the battles fought or won. We are keepers of peace, in heart and mind, Seekers of a harmony we strive to find. **(Verse 8)** So, in this sound bath, let's renew our vow, To serve with compassion, more than ever, now. In the resonance of peace, let our spirits soar, United in purpose, stronger than before."},{"prompt":"write a lengthy sound bath guided imagery meditation for a police officer","completion":"# Sound Bath Guided Imagery Meditation for a Police Officer Welcome to this guided sound bath meditation, designed specifically for those who serve and protect. As a police officer, you encounter unique stresses and challenges every day. This meditation aims to offer you a peaceful retreat, helping you to rejuvenate your mind, body, and spirit. Please find a comfortable position, perhaps lying down or sitting in a quiet, safe space where you won’t be disturbed. Allow yourself to adjust your body until you find a position of complete relaxation. Close your eyes gently, and let's begin. # Beginning Relaxation Take a deep breath in, filling your lungs fully – feeling the air energizing every part of your being. Hold it for a moment at the top of the breath. Now, exhale slowly, letting go of all the tension, stress, and thoughts of the day. Again, inhale deeply, feeling a sense of calm spreading throughout your body. And as you exhale, imagine releasing any lingering stress or worries. With each breath, allow yourself to sink deeper into relaxation. Now, as the soothing sounds of the sound bath begin to envelop you, imagine yourself standing at the edge of a tranquil forest at dawn. # Guided Imagery The first rays of the sun are peeking through the trees, casting a gentle, warm light over everything. The air is fresh, filled with the peaceful sounds of nature. You take a step forward, your feet touching the soft moss-covered ground. As you walk deeper into the forest, you notice how the trees sway lightly in the breeze, as if they’re greeting you. The sounds of the forest blend with the harmonious tones of the singing bowls, each note resonating with a part of your body, bringing harmony and balance. You come across a gentle stream, its water crystal clear, flowing calmly. You crouch to touch the water; it's cool, refreshing. Looking into the water, you see your reflection – not just as a police officer in uniform, but as the person beneath it. A warrior of peace, strength, and compassion. As you stand, you take a deep breath, absorbing the serene energy of the forest, and as you breathe out, you let go of the heavy weight of your duty belt, the responsibilities, and the stress. Here, you are simply yourself, at peace. # Reconnecting with Purpose Continuing your journey, you hear the sounds of a distant waterfall. You follow the sound, and with each step, you feel lighter, more at ease. The soothing tones of the sound bath guide you, echoing the peacefulness of the forest. You arrive at the waterfall, its water cascading down with grace and power. You understand that, like the waterfall, you too have immense strength and the ability to move obstacles, yet you possess the grace to flow around them when needed. Standing before the waterfall, you envision washing away any doubts, fears, or pains. The water purifies your heart, mind, and spirit, renewing your sense of purpose – to serve, protect, and heal. # Peaceful Return As the sound bath tones gently fade, imagine turning back, walking out of the forest, feeling rejuvenated, balanced, and peaceful. With each step, you bring with you the calm and strength from the forest, ready to face the world once more, but now with a renewed spirit. You come back to the edge of the forest, the sun fully risen, its warm light embracing you. As you take a deep breath, gently begin to bring your awareness back to the present moment. Feel the surface beneath you, hear the sounds around you, and slowly, when you’re ready, open your eyes. # Closing Thank you for taking this journey with me. Remember, this forest of peace resides within you, accessible anytime you seek tranquility. Carry this peace with you as you continue to serve, protect, and make a difference in the world."},{"prompt":"write a lengthy sound bath meditation for a police officer","completion":"# Sound Bath Meditation for Renewal and Resilience Welcome, officer. You have chosen a path that demands courage, compassion, and resilience. This sound bath meditation is crafted to support you, providing a sanctuary for your mind and spirit. It's a space where you can lay down the weight of your responsibilities, if only for a moment, and immerse yourself in a sea of tranquility. Let's embark on this journey together, allowing the harmonious vibrations to guide us toward inner peace and strength. Finding Comfort and Stillness Begin by finding a quiet, secure place where you can remain undisturbed. Sit or lie down in a position that feels most comfortable for you. Allow your hands to rest gently by your side or on your lap. Close your eyes, take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, feel yourself sinking deeper into relaxation. With every breath, release the tensions of the day. Let go of the external identity that your uniform represents and connect with the essence of who you are at your core. Breath Awareness As the sounds of the singing bowls gently commence, bring your attention to your breath. Notice the natural rhythm of your breathing, the rise and fall of your chest or abdomen. With each inhale, imagine drawing in peace and serenity. With each exhale, release any thoughts, concerns, or tensions that may be occupying your mind. Allow the resonant tones of the bowls to merge with your breath, creating a symphony of calm within you. Visualization for Release Imagine now a stream of light descending from above, enveloping you in a warm, gentle glow. This light represents pure, healing energy. See it dissolving any physical discomfort, stress, or emotional burden you may be carrying. As this light touches each part of your body, from the crown of your head down to the soles of your feet, feel a sense of release. Visualize any negativity or heaviness flowing out of you, leaving your body, and being replaced by a sense of lightness and clarity. Embracing Serenity Now, let this visual journey take you to a place of profound tranquility. Picture yourself in a serene environment - it could be a quiet forest, a peaceful beach, or any place where you feel safe and calm. While you're here, there's nothing you need to do, nowhere else you need to be. You are simply present, bathed in the soothing vibrations of the sound bath. The harmonies surround you, filling this space with an aura of serenity, washing over you like gentle waves. Each note, each vibration, is a reminder of the peace that resides within you, even amidst chaos. Strength and Renewal In this place of deep serenity, take a moment to acknowledge your strength, resilience, and the compassion that guides you in your profession. With each tone of the singing bowls, feel these qualities being amplified within you. You are a pillar of strength for your community, a bearer of hope, and a guardian of peace. Allow the sound waves to fortify this sense of purpose, to heal any weariness of heart, and to rejuvenate your spirit. Return with Renewed Purpose Gradually, as the sound bath approaches its conclusion, start to bring your awareness back to the present moment. But you don't return empty-handed; you bring back with you the peace, the strength, and the renewal you've experienced. Slowly become aware of the physical space around you, the surface beneath you, and the rhythm of your breath. When you feel ready, gently open your eyes. Take a deep, grounding breath in, and as you exhale, embrace a sense of readiness to face the challenges and joys that your role as an officer brings with each new day. Closing Gratitude Thank you for dedicating this time to yourself, for acknowledging the importance of nurturing your inner well-being amidst your demanding duties. Carry the tranquility and strength you've cultivated today with you, allowing it to be a source of resilience in your service and protection of others. Remember, this sanctuary of peace is always within your reach, anytime you need to reconnect with your inner calm and strength. May you continue to serve with courage, guided by the light of compassion and the wisdom of peace.

However, some common methods and indicators that are used to predict economic development include: 1. GDP growth: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a key indicator of economic activity and growth. Predicting future GDP growth can give insight into the overall economic health of a country or region. 2. Inflation rate: Inflation can impact consumer purchasing power and overall economic stability. Predicting changes in the inflation rate can help forecast future economic performance. 3. Unemployment rate: High levels of unemployment can indicate economic weakness, while low levels can signal economic strength. Predicting changes in the unemployment rate can provide insight into future labor market conditions. 4. Consumer and business confidence: Consumer and business sentiment can affect spending and investment decisions, which in turn can impact economic growth. Monitoring surveys of consumer and business confidence can help predict economic development. 5. Interest rates: Central banks use interest rates to control inflation and stimulate or slow down economic activity. Predicting changes in interest rates can provide insight into future economic conditions. 6. Government policies and regulations: Changes in government policies and regulations can have a significant impact on economic development. Monitoring government actions and announcements can help predict future economic trends. It is important to note that predicting economic development is not an exact science, and there are many uncertainties and external factors that can influence the economy. Utilizing a combination of these indicators and staying informed about current events and trends can help improve the accuracy of economic predictions."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Cependant, selon l’installateur qui est venu sur place, Brinks proposerait 2 systèmes d’alarme, dont un qui est similaire à celui qu’on utilisait les dernières années. Cependant, nous n’avons pas été demandés quel système nous voulons choisir ni expliqués quels sont les inconvénients ou avantage du système qu’ils ont choisi d’installer chez nous sans nous demander. Il faut avant tout changement demander au client quelles attentes il a envers un potentiel changement de système d’alarme, comment est-ce qu’il utilise le système etc. De plus,le système que Brinks a installé ne fonctionne uniquement par télécommande ou application téléphone ce qui n’est pas tout de même logique pour une utilisation efficace du système d'alarme. Si nous n'avons pas de télécommande sur nous ni de batterie sur le téléphone alors nous ne pourrons pas activer ou désactiver l'alarme étant donné qu'on n'a plus de base d'alarme.

Mon intention est d'exprimer une préoccupation importante concernant le récent remplacement de notre système d'alarme et la manière dont celui-ci a été géré. Il nous a été signalé que Brinks propose actuellement deux types de systèmes d'alarme. Toutefois, à notre grande surprise, l'installation du nouveau système chez nous a été réalisée sans aucune consultation préalable. Nous n'avons à aucun moment été sollicités pour choisir parmi les options disponibles ni informés des avantages et inconvénients respectifs de chaque système. Un tel manque de communication nous a empêchés d'exprimer nos besoins réels et nos attentes quant à la mise à niveau du système d'alarme. Le système qui a été installé repose exclusivement sur une télécommande ou une application de téléphone pour son activation ou sa désactivation, ce qui nous semble contraire aux principes d'une utilisation efficace et sécurisée. Nous sommes particulièrement préoccupés par le fait qu'en l'absence de télécommande ou en cas de batterie de téléphone épuisée, il devient impossible de gérer l'alarme, nous laissant ainsi dans une situation potentiellement vulnérable. En outre, nous avons été informés que l'acquisition d'une télécommande supplémentaire engendrerait des coûts additionnels de 2 EUR par mois. Considérant notre longue relation client avec Brinks, cette approche nous apparaît pénalisante et loin d'être à l'écoute du client, surtout pour les familles nécessitant plus d'une télécommande pour gérer leur système de sécurité de manière pratique et efficace. Dans cette optique, nous sollicitons une rencontre ou un entretien téléphonique afin de discuter des solutions possibles qui pourraient mieux répondre à nos besoins et attentes en tant que clients loyaux. Nous sommes convaincus qu'une approche plus personnalisée et attentive envers vos clients de longue date contribuera grandement à maintenir la confiance et la satisfaction dans les services de Brinks.

A bounding box is usually defined by the coordinates of its corners. In a 2D space, this commonly takes the form of the top left corner ((x_{min}, y_{min})) and the bottom right corner ((x_{max}, y_{max})). The area of the bounding box can be calculated with the width and height of the box, where: - Width is the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates ((x_{max} - x_{min})) - Height is the difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates ((y_{max} - y_{min})) Therefore, the area of the bounding box is (Width times Height). Here is a simple Python function to calculate this: \`\`\`python def calculate_bounding_box_area(x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max): width = x_max - x_min height = y_max - y_min area = width * height return area # Example usage x_min, y_min = 1, 2 x_max, y_max = 5, 6 area = calculate_bounding_box_area(x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max) print(\\"Area of bounding box:\\", area) \`\`\` This will output: \`\`\` Area of bounding box: 16 \`\`\` In this example, \`(1, 2)\` are the coordinates of the top left corner, and \`(5, 6)\` are the coordinates of the bottom right corner of the bounding box. The width of the box is \`5 - 1 = 4\` units, and the height is \`6 - 2 = 4\` units, making the area \`4 * 4 = 16\` square units. For 3D bounding boxes, the concept is similar but with an additional dimension (z), and you would calculate the volume instead of area. You would use the differences between the max and min of x, y, and z coordinates to find the length, width, and height, respectively, and then multiply them together to get the volume. However, for the 2D case as initially described, the given method will suffice."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Since its founding in 1988, the party's ideology and position within the political spectrum have notably evolved. Initially established as a youth liberal democratic party opposing the communist regime, Fidesz has undergone significant ideological shifts over the decades, moving towards the center-right and eventually adopting more conservative, nationalist, and populist stances. As of the last knowledge update in 2023, the main political ideologies and characteristics of Fidesz can be summarized as follows: # Conservatism Fidesz embraces many aspects of conservative ideology, including the promotion of traditional values, skepticism towards rapid societal changes, and a focus on national identity. # Nationalism A strong sense of Hungarian nationalism is central to Fidesz's platform. This includes an emphasis on sovereignty, cultural identity, and sometimes skepticism or criticism towards international organizations and influences that are perceived as threats to Hungary's autonomy. # Populism Fidesz's rhetoric often includes populist elements, framing politics as a battle between the \\"honest people\\" and the \\"corrupt elite.\\" This approach has been a significant aspect of its electoral strategy, appealing to a broad base of voters who feel disillusioned with traditional political elites. # Sovereignty and Anti-Globalism Fidesz strongly advocates for maintaining Hungarian sovereignty against what it perceives as undue external influence, be it from the European Union, multinational corporations, or other international entities. It often positions itself against globalist policies in favor of national interests. # Social Conservatism The party promotes social conservatism, including traditional family values and policies that reflect these views. This has included opposition to same-sex marriage and other stances that align with conservative social policies. # Economic Policy Fidesz's economic policies have included a mix of interventionist government actions and incentives to promote domestic businesses, while also pursuing measures aimed at financial stability and attracting foreign investment. The approach can be described as pragmatically nationalist, sometimes deviating from classical economic liberalism in favor of policies that protect national interests. # Euroscepticism While Fidesz is not outright anti-European Union, it has expressed significant eurosceptic sentiments, particularly concerning issues of national sovereignty, migration, and cultural identity. The party has often clashed with EU institutions over various policies and directives. # Migration Policies Fidesz has adopted a strong stance against immigration, particularly from outside the EU, framing it as a threat to Hungarian cultural identity and security. This has been a defining feature of its policies and political messaging, especially from 2015 onwards during the European migrant crisis. It is important to note that political ideologies and positions can evolve, and the way a party presents its platform or implements policies can vary over time. Fidesz's positions also reflect broader trends in European politics, where many parties have shifted in response to globalization, migration, and changing societal values."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Hier sind einige effektive Wege, um Blutflecken zu bekämpfen: 1. **Kaltwasser**: Blutflecken sollten immer mit kaltem Wasser behandelt werden, da warmes Wasser das Protein im Blut gerinnen lässt und den Fleck noch schwerer entfernt. Weichen Sie das Kleidungsstück für einige Stunden in kaltem Wasser ein und spülen Sie es dann aus. Eventuell müssen Sie diesen Vorgang mehrmals wiederholen. 2. **Salzwasser**: Lösen Sie Salz in kaltem Wasser auf und verwenden Sie diese Mischung, um das Kleidungsstück einzutauchen oder den Fleck direkt zu behandeln. Salzwasser kann helfen, das Blut aufzubrechen und aus dem Stoff zu lösen. 3. **Backpulver**: Machen Sie eine Paste aus Backpulver und Wasser und tragen Sie sie auf den Fleck auf. Lassen Sie die Paste trocknen und bürsten Sie dann das überschüssige Pulver ab, bevor Sie das Kleidungsstück wie gewohnt waschen. 4. **Wasserstoffperoxid**: Für helle Stoffe kann Wasserstoffperoxid eine gute Option sein, da es bleichende Eigenschaften hat. Tragen Sie etwas Wasserstoffperoxid direkt auf den Fleck auf und lassen Sie es einige Minuten einwirken, bevor Sie es abspülen. Achten Sie darauf, dass Wasserstoffperoxid Farben ausbleichen kann, daher sollte es vorher an einer unauffälligen Stelle getestet werden. 5. **Enzymatisches Waschmittel**: Enzymhaltige Waschmittel sind effektiv bei der Auflösung von Proteinen, zu denen auch Blut gehört. Weichen Sie das Kleidungsstück vor dem Waschen in einer Lösung aus Wasser und enzymatischem Waschmittel ein. 6. **Aspirin oder Fleckentferner**: Eine Paste aus zerstoßenem Aspirin und Wasser kann auf den Fleck aufgetragen werden, um ihn aufzubrechen. Auch handelsübliche Fleckentferner, die speziell für Proteinbasierende Flecken (wie Blut) formuliert sind, können effektiv sein. Wichtig: Überprüfen Sie immer die Pflegehinweise des Kleidungsstücks, bevor Sie Behandlungsmethoden anwenden, und testen Sie die Methode an einer unauffälligen Stelle, um sicherzustellen, dass keine Schäden oder Verfärbungen auftreten. Ebenfalls zu beachten ist, dass sich einige Flecken, insbesondere ältere oder bereits behandelte, möglicherweise nicht vollständig entfernen lassen."},{"prompt":"Womit beginnen?","completion":"Wenn Sie sich mit einem eingetrockneten Blutfleck auf Kleidung konfrontiert sehen, ist es sinnvoll, bei der Reinigung mit dem schonendsten Ansatz zu beginnen und sich bei Bedarf zu stärkeren Methoden vorzuarbeiten. Hier ist ein empfohlener Ablauf: 1. **Kaltwasser**: Beginnen Sie immer mit Kaltwasser, da es am schonendsten ist und hilft, das Blut aufzuweichen, ohne es weiter in den Stoff einzuschließen. Tauchen Sie das Kleidungsstück in kaltes Wasser oder lassen Sie kaltes Wasser direkt auf den Fleck laufen. 2. **Salzwasser**: Wenn das Kaltwasser nicht ausreicht, weichen Sie den Fleck als nächstes in einer Salzwasserlösung ein. Das Salz kann helfen, das eingetrocknete Blut weiter aufzubrechen. 3. **Backpulver**: Sollte der Fleck immer noch sichtbar sein, können Sie eine Paste aus Backpulver und Wasser herstellen und auf den Fleck auftragen. Dies hilft oft, den Fleck aus dem Stoff zu ziehen. 4. **Wasserstoffperoxid**: Für weiße oder sehr helle Stoffe, bei denen Farbechtheit weniger eine Sorge darstellt, kann Wasserstoffperoxid eine effektive Option sein. Es hat eine bleichende Wirkung und sollte vorsichtig verwendet werden. 5. **Enzymatisches Waschmittel oder Fleckentferner**: Als nächsten Schritt können Sie ein enzymatisches Waschmittel oder einen speziellen Fleckentferner probieren. Diese Produkte sind darauf ausgelegt, proteinbasierte Flecken wie Blut aufzulösen. 6. **Professionelle Reinigung**: Sollten alle zu Hause verfügbaren Methoden versagen und der Fleck weiterhin bestehen, könnten Sie in Erwägung ziehen, das Kleidungsstück zu einer professionellen Reinigung zu bringen, besonders wenn es sich um ein empfindliches oder wertvolles Stück handelt. Bei jeder dieser Methoden ist es wichtig, den Fleck und das Waschwasser regelmäßig zu inspizieren, um den Fortschritt zu beobachten. Manche Methoden, besonders jene, die auf chemischer Reaktion basieren (wie Wasserstoffperoxid), sollten mit Vorsicht und nach Anleitung verwendet werden, um Schäden am Stoff zu vermeiden."},{"prompt":"Hell taker Eclipse Enigma: Solitude’s Shadow Savant","completion":"As of my last update in April 2023, \\"Helltaker\\" remains a popular indie puzzle-adventure game, created by Łukasz Piskorz (also known as Vanripper), that has gained a notable following for its creative gameplay, unique storyline, and the charming demons the player encounters. However, there isn't official information on an extension or update named \\"Eclipse Enigma: Solitude’s Shadow Savant\\". It sounds like it could be a fan-generated concept or wish for future content rather than an official expansion or sequel to the game. \\"Helltaker\\" itself is a short game that involves solving puzzles to proceed through various levels, with the goal of creating a harem of demon girls. Its charm largely comes from its engaging puzzles, humorous dialogue, and appealing character design. Despite its relatively short gameplay, it's had a significant impact on its fan community, inspiring a range of fan art, stories, and mods. Game developers often expand on games through DLCs, updates, or sequels given enough interest and support from the fanbase, so it's always possible future content could be developed if it hasn't been already. For the most accurate and updated information on \\"Helltaker\\" and any expansions, DLCs, or sequels, it's best to check official sources like the creator's social media accounts, the official game website, or reputable gaming news outlets."},{"prompt":"It's a fan created Oc what would Eclipse Enigma: Solitude’s Shadow Savant diologe (she antisocial)","completion":"Creating dialogue for an original character (OC) such as Eclipse Enigma: Solitude’s Shadow Savant, especially given her antisocial nature, presents a unique opportunity to explore complex character depth through her interactions. Considering her personality, her dialogue would likely reflect her preference for solitude, a possible disdain or discomfort towards social interactions, and perhaps a sharp, intelligent wit that she doesn’t often share with others. Here’s a small dialogue scenario that might fit Eclipse in the world of \\"Helltaker\\": --- **[The protagonist encounters Eclipse in a dimly lit library, books and ancient scrolls surrounding her. She doesn't look up immediately, her attention fixed on a large, ancient tome.]** **Protagonist**: \\"Greetings, I've heard tales of your wisdom. They call you Solitude’s Shadow Savant, no?\\" **Eclipse Enigma** (without looking up): \\"Tales have a way of growing taller and shadows longer than reality. Why disturb this one?\\" **Protagonist**: \\"I seek knowledge that can only be found in the shadows. They say you're the keeper of such truths.\\" **Eclipse Enigma** (finally glancing at the protagonist, her gaze sharp, yet holding a glint of curiosity): \\"And what makes you think I would share the whispers of the shadows with someone who walks in the light?\\" **Protagonist**: \\"Because every shadow needs light to exist. Perhaps we can help each other.\\" **Eclipse Enigma** (a small, knowing smile appearing on her lips): \\"Clever. But tread carefully; the path of knowledge I walk is littered with those who thought they could dance with shadows without getting lost. What is it that you seek?\\" --- This dialogue reflects Eclipse’s initial distrust and preference for solitude, her intelligence, and the sort of sharp, contemplative exchanges she might have. In this scenario, she’s intrigued by the protagonist’s persistence and wit, which prompts a rare show of curiosity towards someone else’s desires—an opportunity for her to potentially open up, albeit carefully and with a guarded attitude. Given her antisocial nature, any dialogue involving Eclipse would likely involve her slowly warming up to the idea of interaction, always careful, always observant, and intellectually probing."},{"prompt":"Dire qu'une grandeur Y diminué de 2% signifie que Y est multipliée par","completion":"98%."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here are several key components to achieving this: # 1. **Clear Goals and Motivations** - **Personal Stakes:** The protagonist must have a clear goal or motivation that is deeply personal and important to them. This goal should be challenging but achievable, and the reason they pursue this goal should be compelling. - **Internal and External Goals:** Often, a protagonist has an external goal (e.g., to save the world) and an internal goal (e.g., to find self-confidence). The internal goal should influence how they pursue the external one, making their journey more complex and interesting. # 2. **Obstacles and Conflicts** - **Realistic Challenges:** To keep the struggle realistic, obstacles must be significant and believable. These can be external (antagonists, natural disasters, societal expectations) or internal (fears, doubts, flaws). - **Consequences:**Actions taken by the protagonist should have consequences, both intended and unintended. This not only keeps the plot moving but also adds depth to the story, showing that the world operates independently of the protagonist's desires. # 3. **Agency and Decision-Making** - **Active Participation:** The protagonist should be making decisions that actively influence the plot. This includes taking risks, making sacrifices, and sometimes failing. Their actions should stem from their motivations and personality, making their path through the story unique. - **Decision Points:** Key moments where the protagonist must make difficult decisions can serve to highlight their growth, reveal character, and propel the plot forward. These moments also increase tension and keep readers engaged. # 4. **Growth and Change** - **Character Arc:** A realistic struggle often involves change. The protagonist should grow or change in some significant way by the end of the story, learning from their successes and failures. This arc makes their journey satisfying and believable. - **Learning Curve:** The protagonist shouldn’t be perfect at everything they attempt. A realistic struggle includes learning from mistakes, acquiring new skills, or gaining insights. This progression adds credibility to their journey. # 5. **Diverse Influences** - **Supporting Characters:** Include a range of supporting characters who challenge, support, obstruct, or guide the protagonist. Their interactions with these characters can provide opportunities for growth and make their struggle more complex and realistic. - **Environmental Factors:** The setting and time period can also present realistic challenges for the protagonist. These environmental factors should be more than a backdrop; they should actively influence the protagonist’s decisions and actions. # Achieving Balance Combining these elements effectively requires balance. A protagonist who always succeeds easily might seem unrealistic, but one who never succeeds can be frustrating for readers. The key is to show a believable progression, where successes are earned and setbacks are meaningful. The protagonist's actions should feel like they are genuinely affecting the course of events, and their struggle should resonate with readers as authentic and relatable."},{"prompt":"what can be infuriating about characters that say, think, feel, and do things because the plot says so?","completion":"Characters that say, think, feel, and do things merely because the plot demands it, without these actions being grounded in their established personalities or motivations, can lead to several frustrations among readers or viewers. This often stems from a lack of character agency and consistency, making the story feel forced or artificial. Here are some reasons why such character behavior can be infuriating: # 1. **Lack of Authenticity** - Characters acting out of convenience for the plot rather than from their developed personalities or motivations can break the immersion of the story. When characters do things that don't align with what has been established about them, it can make them seem less like real people and more like pawns of the writer's will, detracting from the story's authenticity. # 2. **Predictability** - If characters consistently make choices that serve the plot's need for drama or conflict, rather than choices that seem true to their nature, the story can become predictable. Readers may notice patterns in character behavior that prioritize plot progression over consistent character development, leading to a lack of suspense or engagement. # 3. **Lack of Emotional Engagement** - Emotional investment in a story significantly depends on readers forming connections with the characters. When characters lack consistent motivations and behave erratically to serve the plot, it becomes difficult for readers to empathize with or understand them. This disconnect makes it hard to care about the characters' journeys or outcomes. # 4. **Broken Character Arcs** - Character growth and arcs become less meaningful when actions are dictated solely by plot needs. For a character arc to be compelling, the changes in a character should come from their experiences, decisions, and the consequences of those decisions. When this process is short-circuited by plot convenience, it undermines the journey of growth and makes character development feel unearned. # 5. **Forces Conflict and Resolution** - Conflict that arises not organically from characters’ desires and obstacles but rather from the necessity to move the plot along can feel forced and unengaging. Similarly, resolutions that occur because the plot demands a conclusion, rather than as a natural consequence of the characters’ actions and growth, can seem abrupt and unsatisfying. # 6. **Diminished Stakes** - When characters act out of alignment with their established selves for the sake of plot progression, it can diminish the perceived stakes of the story. If readers believe that characters will always act in a way that serves plot convenience, it lowers the tension because outcomes feel predetermined by narrative necessity rather than organic character decisions. # Addressing the Issue Writers can avoid these pitfalls by prioritizing character consistency and ensuring that actions and decisions stem organically from characters' motivations and personalities. Developing a deep understanding of each character, including their desires, fears, and limits, can help ensure that their actions are believable and meaningful—thus maintaining the integrity of both character arcs and the overall plot."},{"prompt":"how impactful could it be for the story if not all problems are solved, and there are times where the protagonist gives up on certain problems, and never returns to them?","completion":"Leaving some problems unsolved in a story and having a protagonist give up on certain issues without revisiting them can significantly impact the narrative and its reception in several profound ways. This approach can add layers of realism, provoke thought, and elicit strong emotional responses, ultimately enriching the story. Here's how these narrative choices can be impactful: # 1. **Realism and Relatability** Life often presents challenges that remain unresolved or require individuals to adjust their goals and expectations. By mirroring this reality, a story can resonate more deeply with its audience, increasing its relatability. Characters who face insurmountable obstacles, recognize their limits, and sometimes choose to abandon certain pursuits can reflect the complex nature of human decision-making and perseverance. This realism can help readers/viewers see parts of their struggles and realities within the story, fostering a deeper connection. # 2. **Character Depth and Growth** Choosing to let a protagonist give up on a problem can be a powerful tool for character development. It can demonstrate maturity, wisdom, or a prioritization of values, showing character growth in a non-traditional but realistic manner. The decision to move on from certain challenges can reveal the protagonist’s priorities, strengths, and vulnerabilities, offering a more nuanced portrait of who they are and who they become. # 3. **Theme Exploration** Not resolving all problems allows for the exploration of themes such as acceptance, loss, and the limitations of control. It can prompt readers to think deeply about the nature of problems, the idea of closure, and the human capacity for change and adaptation. Stories that explore the reality of unfinished business or unattained goals can leave a lasting impression by encouraging reflection on the inevitability of such outcomes in everyone's lives. # 4. **Avoidance of Conventional Narratives** By choosing not to tie up all loose ends or have the protagonist succeed at every turn, the narrative avoids the predictability and simplicity of many conventional stories. This can make the story stand out, offering an unexpected and thought-provoking journey. It challenges the audience's expectations for a neatly wrapped conclusion, providing a more memorable and discussion-worthy experience. # 5. **Emotional Impact** The emotional journey of dealing with unresolved issues or the conscious decision to give up can be profound. Readers might experience frustration, sadness, or empathy, but these emotions are a testament to the story's impact. Engaging with these feelings can make the narrative more impactful and enduring in the minds of the audience. # 6. **Reflects the Complexity of Life** By not solving all problems, the story acknowledges the complexity of life and the multifaceted nature of human existence. It reflects the truth that some issues are beyond resolution, some battles are lost, and some dreams remain unfulfilled. This acknowledgment can foster a sense of solidarity and understanding among readers, making them feel seen and heard. # Conclusion While traditional storytelling often emphasizes resolution and the overcoming of obstacles, choosing to leave some problems unsolved and allowing the protagonist to give up on certain challenges can offer a richer, more reflective, and emotionally resonant narrative. This approach underlines the importance of the journey over the destination and highlights the value of self-awareness, acceptance, and the courage to move forward in the face of unresolved challenges."},{"prompt":"what can be lame about a protagonist that just lets everyone else influence their thoughts and actions and opinions?","completion":"A protagonist who consistently allows others to influence their thoughts, actions, and opinions, without showing significant personal growth or agency, can be problematic for several reasons. Such a character can negatively impact the story's engagement level, its thematic depth, and the audience's connection to the narrative. Here are specific aspects that can be considered \\"lame\\" or less appealing about this character type: # 1. **Lack of Agency** A protagonist with weak personal agency fails to drive the story forward through their decisions and actions. Instead of shaping the narrative, they become a passive recipient of others' influences. This can make the plot feel aimless or driven more by chance and external forces than by the protagonist's desires and struggles, potentially leading to a less compelling or satisfying story. # 2. **Reduced Relatability** While it's human to be influenced by others, a character who shows no backbone or independent thought can be difficult for audiences to relate to or root for. Readers and viewers often look for aspects of themselves in protagonists, including the ability to grow, learn, and eventually stand up for one's beliefs. A protagonist lacking these qualities might not evoke empathy or investment from the audience. # 3. **Predictable Character Arc** If a protagonist’s character arc consists solely of them being swayed by others without eventually learning to assert their independence, the arc can feel shallow and predictable. Part of what makes a character arc engaging is witnessing growth, struggles, and change. Without this, the protagonist’s journey can lack depth and fail to hold the audience's interest. # 4. **Missed Opportunities for Conflict and Growth** A protagonist who doesn't wrestle with inner conflicts or challenges and merely adopts the perspectives of those around them misses opportunities for rich, internal exploration and character development. Conflict, both internal and external, is a driving force in storytelling. It propels characters to grow, make difficult decisions, and overcome obstacles. Without this, the story can feel flat and the protagonist unevolved. # 5. **Undermines Themes** Powerful themes often emerge from a protagonist’s ability to navigate the push and pull of external influences while forging their path and standing by their convictions. A protagonist lacking this interaction may undermine or oversimplify thematic exploration, rendering the story's message less impactful or nuanced. # 6. **Diminished Emotional Impact** Protagonists who actively engage with their challenges, face conflicts, and are forced to make hard decisions generate emotional stakes. When a protagonist remains passive or overly influenced by others without pushing back, it can diminish the story's emotional impact. Audiences engage more deeply with stories where they fear for the protagonist, hope for their successes, and mourn their losses. # Tackling the Issue Addressing this issue often involves giving the protagonist moments of realization, confrontations that challenge their passivity, or introducing stakes high enough to require them to take a stand. By designing a narrative that gradually builds the protagonist's sense of self and agency, writers can transform a potentially \\"lame\\" character into a compelling and dynamic force within the story. Through this transformation, the story gains depth, engagement, and a more meaningful connection with its audience."},{"prompt":"how could action scenes, if any, be done in a mature way without coming off as a spectacle?","completion":"Action scenes, while often associated with blockbuster spectacle and visual extravagance, can also be crafted in a mature, meaningful manner that emphasizes character development, thematic depth, and realism. Here’s how to approach action scenes to ensure they resonate on a deeper level without relying on spectacle: # 1. **Focus on Realism and Consequences** - **Physical and Emotional Realism:** Ground action scenes in the physical and emotional reality of the characters. This means acknowledging pain, fear, and exhaustion rather than portraying characters as invulnerable. Realistic portrayals make the action more relatable and impactful. - **Show Consequences:** Every action scene should have consequences for the characters involved, whether physical, emotional, or narrative. These consequences can add weight to the action, making it feel like a significant event that changes the characters or their situation. # 2. **Character-Driven Action** - **Motivations and Stakes:** Ensure that the action scenes are motivated by character desires and needs. Why are the characters involved in this action? What personal stakes do they have in the outcome? Answers to these questions can provide the action with a sense of purpose beyond mere spectacle. - **Character Choices and Growth:** Use action scenes as opportunities for character choices and growth. Characters might need to make difficult decisions under pressure, revealing their priorities, fears, and capabilities. This approach can deepen the audience's investment in the characters and the story. # 3. **Strategic Placement and Pacing** - **Build Tension:** Place action scenes strategically within the narrative to build tension and serve the story's pacing. Not every scene has to be high-octane; varying the intensity and type of action can make the moments that do happen more powerful. - **Pacing Within the Scene:** Within an action scene, pay attention to pacing. Use slower moments of tension-building and quicker, more intense bursts of action to create a dynamic rhythm that keeps viewers engaged without overwhelming them. # 4. **Purposeful Choreography** - **Serve the Story:** Choreograph action in a way that serves the story and character development. Every move or sequence should feel purposeful, advancing the plot, revealing character, or exploring themes, rather than merely showcasing abilities or techniques. - **Innovative and Unique Approaches:** Consider less conventional approaches to action. This could be through innovative use of the environment, focusing on the psychology of confrontation, or employing strategy and intelligence over brute force. # 5. **Thematic Integration** - **Reflect Themes:** Action scenes should reflect and explore the themes of the story. For example, if the story deals with themes of sacrifice, how do the action scenes test the characters' willingness to sacrifice for each other or their cause? - **Symbolic Action:** Consider how the action can be symbolic or metaphorical, representing larger conflicts, themes, or character dynamics beyond the immediate physical confrontation. # 6. **Sensory Description Over Spectacle** - **Immerse the Audience:** In written narratives, use sensory description to immerse the audience in the scene. Focus on the sights, sounds, smells, and tactile sensations of the action. This can create a vivid, engaging scene without resorting to spectacle. - **Emotional and Psychological Focus:** In both written and visual media, focusing on the emotional and psychological experience of the characters during action can create a more immersive and meaningful experience than spectacle alone. By emphasizing realism, character development, thematic depth, and strategic choreography, action scenes can be mature, meaningful, and integral to the narrative’s progression, rather than mere spectacles. This approach ensures that action scenes contribute significantly to the story, deepening the audience's engagement and emotional investment."},{"prompt":"I meant in a film or series.","completion":"Crafting mature action scenes in films or series, without relying on spectacle, involves careful consideration of narrative purpose, character development, and thematic depth. Here's how filmmakers and screenwriters can achieve this: # 1. **Realism and Consequences** - **Physical Realism:** Avoid overly choreographed or unrealistic sequences that defy the laws of physics without good reason. Instead, opt for action that acknowledges the characters' human limitations and vulnerability. The portrayal of injuries, exhaustion, and the consequences of violence can add a layer of realism and gravity to the scene. - **Emotional Consequences:** Action scenes should have lasting impacts on the characters involved, affecting their emotional and psychological state. This enriches the story and makes the action feel more significant. # 2. **Character-Driven Action** - **Motivated by Character Needs and Desires:** Ensure that the action scenes are deeply rooted in the characters’ motivations. The best action scenes are those where the stakes are personal, and the outcome matters deeply to those involved. - **Character Development:** Use action scenes as a means to develop your characters. How they react under pressure, the decisions they make, and how they interact with others in these moments can reveal new facets of their character. # 3. **Strategic Placement and Pacing** - **Build Tension:** Treat action scenes as part of the overall narrative pacing, using them to build tension and release it in a way that serves the story's emotional arc. Not every moment has to be action-packed; the anticipation and aftermath are just as critical. - **Dynamics Within the Scene:** Balance the intensity within the scene itself, mixing faster-paced action with slower, more intense moments of decision-making or reflection to keep the audience engaged. # 4. **Purposeful Choreography** - **Supports the Narrative:** Choreograph action sequences in a way that advances the story or sheds light on character relationships and dynamics. Avoid gratuitous violence or action for action’s sake. - **Unique and Creative:** Seek innovative ways to stage action, using the environment, character skills, or the story’s unique elements to bring fresh perspectives to action scenes, making them memorable beyond their immediate impact. # 5. **Thematic Integration** - **Reflects Larger Themes:** Make sure action scenes are thematically integrated, reflecting the larger story's themes. This could mean staging a fight that’s not just about physical dominance but about ideological differences, or a chase that underlines a character’s deeper emotional escape. - **Symbolism and Metaphor:** Utilize action as a means to explore symbolic or metaphorical battles, enriching the narrative’s depth and providing audiences with rich material for interpretation. # 6. **Focus on Impact Over Spectacle** - **Emphasize Emotional and Psychological Experience:** Highlight what the characters are going through mentally and emotionally during the action. This creates a deeper connection between the audience and the characters, making the scene about more than just its visual impact. - **Cinematic Techniques:** Utilize cinematography, editing, and sound design to enhance the realism and emotional resonance of the action, rather than leaning on excessive special effects. Thoughtful use of these elements can increase the impact of action scenes without overwhelming the audience with spectacle. By prioritizing these aspects, filmmakers can create action scenes that are mature, meaningful, and integral to the story's development, resonating with audiences on a deeper level than spectacle alone. This approach ensures that action sequences contribute to the thematic richness and character exploration that define compelling narratives in film and series."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.
