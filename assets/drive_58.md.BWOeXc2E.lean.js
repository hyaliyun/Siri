Each region (sub-board) will have its own marked cell. By dividing the board, we thus aim to ensure distance between the marked cells. 4. **Region Configuration**: - Each of the nine regions will be a 3x3 sub-square, except for a small overlap due to the 8x8 board structure. - Marking one cell in each of these 3x3 sub-squares in a non-adjacent manner will ensure a solution. 5. **Optimal Placement**: - Let's visualize this placement with an example. Consider the below configuration. Each 'X' denotes a marked cell, and every 3x3 block contains exactly one 'X'. \`\`\` X . . | . . . | . .

The 65 onions sold account for 75% of the remaining onions. This means that before the 65 onions were sold, the remaining onions were 100% - 75% = 25% of the total.

Therefore, one side of the triangle is made of two sticks joined together (either two small sticks or combinations of one large and one small stick), and the other sides are each formed by a single stick. 3. **Check possible combinations**: To satisfy the conditions of forming a right triangle, and given the lengths, we explore possible configurations. - If two small sticks are combined: (a + (24 - a) = 24), forming an equilateral triangle, which is not suitable. - If two large sticks are combined: (24 + 24 = 48), but this exceeds the possible total length required for a right triangle relative to the other two sides. - The viable combination thus involves one large stick and one small stick on one side, and the other sides being the smaller and another large stick.

In this scenario, each vertex should have degree 5 (since each circle touches exactly 5 other circles). 4. **Graph Properties and Feasibility:** A 12-vertex graph where each vertex has degree 5 satisfies certain properties.

First, note that ( mathrm{ord}_p(2) ) is either 4 or ( 4q ).

Since the pyramid is regular, the center of the circumscribed sphere lies on this line. 4. **Parallel Line ( m )**: - Draw a line ( m ) parallel to the altitude ( MH ) of the face ( SAB ), passing through the midpoint of ( SB ). - The midpoint of ( SB ) can be found by measuring the distance ( SB ) and dividing it by 2, then marking this point. - Draw a line parallel to ( MH ) from this midpoint. This line intersects the plane in two points, which helps in finding the projection of the circumcenter. 5. **Intersection with Line ( SN )**: - The projection of the line ( m ) will intersect with the projection of the line ( SN ). - This intersection point is the projection on the plane of the center of the circumscribed sphere.

That is, when x = y = frac{1}{2}. At this point, each of the four distances is the length of the line segment from the center of the square to a vertex. The distance from the center to any vertex of a square with side length 1 is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with both legs measuring frac{1}{2}.

When one charge is moved to the center of the square, each distance from the center to any vertex (charge) becomes ( frac{s}{sqrt{2}} ) (the diagonal of the smaller square formed inside). 3. As energy is inversely proportional to distance, when the distance becomes ( frac{s}{sqrt{2}} ) from ( s ), the energy stored between the center charge and each corner would be ( 5 times sqrt{2} ) Joules (since ( frac{s}{s/sqrt{2}} = sqrt{2} )), for every one of the four pairs.

The probability of choosing a pink flower from Bag A is the number of pink flowers in Bag A divided by the total number of flowers in Bag A: P(pink from A) = Number of pink flowers in A / Total number of flowers in A P(pink from A) = 3 / 9 P(pink from A) = 1 / 3 The probability of choosing a pink flower from Bag B is the number of pink flowers in Bag B divided by the total number of flowers in Bag B: P(pink from B) = Number of pink flowers in B / Total number of flowers in B P(pink from B) = 7 / 9 Since we don't know from which bag the flower is chosen, we can assume that there is an equal chance of choosing from either bag.

Here varepsilon is a very small rational number such that q+varepsilon is still rational and does not conflict with any previously written number. For example, if Alice plays q in position (1,A): - Alice writes q in box a (or any box in the first row). - Bob writes q + varepsilon in box d' (or the corresponding box in the second row). This ensures that the order relation of numbers in pairs (a, a'), (b, b'),... remains constant: - If a < b, then a' < b' (due to the small increment varepsilon). - Similarly for all other pairs. 4. **Moving to Remaining Rows**: When Alice writes a number in any box in the remaining rows (3 to 6), Bob likewise writes in any box within rows 3 to 6. This action ensures the first two rows' ordering is preserved while filling in the other parts of the grid. 5. **Examining Resulting Black Boxes**: After the entire grid is filled up, for each pair: left[ begin{array}{cccccc} a & b & c & d & e & f d' & e' & f' & a' & b' & c' end{array} right] The greatest numbers are either both from the upper or lower parts due to close values q, q+varepsilon. This means their greatest number results in non-adjacent black squares. 6. **Bob’s Ensuring Victory**: Since the black squares from each of the pairs (like (a, d')) don't touch, there will be no continuous path from top to bottom composed solely of black squares. Thus, Alice cannot draw the connecting vertical line through the blackened cells, ensuring Bob's victory. 7. **Conclusion**: Bob can always ensure that Alice will not achieve a continuous black path from the top to the bottom of the grid.

When these planes intersect, they form lines, and these lines intersect at a specific point (M). 2. **Determining the intersection point (M)**: - Define points (P) and (Q) as follows: - (P) is the midpoint of the line segment (A_1B). - (Q) is the midpoint of (A_1C). - (P) and (C) are common points of the planes (A_1BC) and (AB_1C), resulting in the intersection line (CP). - (Q) and (B) are common points of the planes (A_1BC) and (ABC_1), resulting in the intersection line (BQ). - Thus, the intersection of (CP) and (BQ) in the plane (A_1BC) locates point (M). 3. **Locating the point (M)**: - In triangle (A_1BC), since (P) is the midpoint of (A_1B) and (Q) is the midpoint of (A_1C), (CP) and (BQ) are medians of the triangle. - The point (M) is the centroid of triangle (A_1BC), located at the intersection of the medians, dividing them in a (2:1) ratio. 4. **Calculating the distance from (M) to the bases**: - Let (D) and (D_1) be the orthogonal projections of (M) onto the planes (ABC) and (A_1B_1C_1), respectively. - Given the centroid property: [ D_1M : DM = 2 : 1 ] - Height (DD_1) of prism = (h). 5. **Using ratio properties to find distances**: - Since (D_1M) and (DM) divide the height (DD_1) in the ratio (2:1): [ DM = frac{1}{3} cdot h, quad D_1M = frac{2}{3} cdot h ] # Conclusion The distances from point (M) to the respective bases of the prism are: [ boxed{frac{1}{3}h text{ and } frac{2}{3}h} ]"},{"prompt":"f (12i)z=5i, then the value of |z| is ( ) A: 3 B: 5 C: sqrt{3} D: sqrt{5}","completion":"From the equation (1-2i)z=5i, we have z= frac{5i}{1-2i}= frac{5i(1+2i)}{(1-2i)(1+2i)}=frac{5i+10i^2}{1-4i^2}=frac{5i-10}{1+4}=frac{-10+5i}{5}=-2+i.

In the right triangle AMC, the median ML is equal to half of the hypotenuse AC, which gives us: [ ML = AL = LC ] 4. According to the problem, since triangle KLM is equilateral, we have KL = ML.

For any matrix ( X in S_r ), the matrix ( AX ) is also in ( S_r ) because the rank of ( AX ) is the same as the rank of ( X ) (since ( A ) is invertible).

Permutation matrices permute the rows of a matrix. Since ( AS = S ) for all permutation matrices ( A ), it follows that all entries of ( S ) must be identical. This is because permutation matrices can move any entry of ( S ) to any other position, implying uniformity in the entries of ( S ). 5. **Entries of ( S )**: Suppose all entries of ( S ) are 1.

This means f(x) is an odd function. Next, we find the derivative of f(x): f'(x) = frac{d}{dx} (sin x + x) = cos x + 1.

Substituting this into our inequality yields: frac{f(ln x) + f(ln x)}{2} < f(1), which simplifies to f(ln x) < f(1).

A line through A_{1}(-a_1, a_2) parallel to vec{d}_{BC} will have the same direction vector, and hence its equation can be written as: (c_{2}-b_{2})x + (c_{1}-b_{1})y = - (c_{2}-b_{2})a_{1} + (c_{1}-b_{1})a_{2} 2. **Equation of the line through B_{1} parallel to AC:** Similarly, a line through B_{1}(-b_1, b_{2}) and parallel to vec{d}_{AC} = (c_{1}-a_{1}, c_{2}-a_{2}) will have the equation: (a_{2}-c_{2})x + (a_{1}-c_{1})y = - (a_{2}-c_{2})(-b_{1}) + (a_{1}-c_{1})b_{2} Simplifying the right-hand side, we get: (a_{2}-c_{2})x + (a_{1}-c_{1})y = (a_{2}-c_{2})b_{1} + (a_{1}-c_{1})b_{2} 3. **Equation of the line through C_{1} parallel to AB:** Finally, a line through C_{1}(-c_{1}, c_{2}) and parallel to vec{d}_{AB} = (b_{1}-a_{1}, b_{2}-a_{2}) will have the equation: (b_{2}-a_{2})x + (b_{1}-a_{1})y = - (b_{2}-a_{2})(-c_{1}) + (b_{1}-a_{1})c_{2} Simplifying the right-hand side, we get: (b_{2}-a_{2})x + (b_{1}-a_{1})y = (b_{2}-a_{2})c_{1} + (b_{1}-a_{1})c_{2} # Intersection Point Calculation: We now have three linear equations representing the lines a, b, and c: 1. left(c_{2}-b_{2}right) x + left(c_{1}-b_{1}right) y = -left(c_{2}-b_{2}right) a_{1} + left(c_{1}-b_{1}right) a_{2} 2. left(a_{2}-c_{2}right) x + left(a_{1}-c_{1}right) y = left(a_{2}-c_{2}right)b_{1} + left(a_{1}-c_{1}right) b_{2} 3. left(b_{2}-a_{2}right) x + left(b_{1}-a_{1}right) y = left(b_{2}-a_{2}right)c_{1} + left(b_{1}-a_{1}right)c_{2} Since the first two lines are not parallel, they intersect at a point P(x, y). To show that this point P also lies on the third line, we can add the left-hand sides of equations (1) and (2) and compare with (3): Now, recall that the left-hand sides of equations (1) and (2) combine to give the direction vectors summing to that of equation (3). Hence, when we add the equations (1) and (2): left[(c_{2}-b_{2})+(a_{2}-c_{2})right] x + left[(c_{1}-b_{1})+(a_{1}-c_{1})right] y = left[-(c_{2}-b_{2}) a_{1} + (c_{1}-b_{1}) a_{2} + (a_{2}-c_{2}) b_{1} + (a_{1}-c_{1}) b_{2}right] Simplifying, we see that they yield the same relationship as equation (3), confirming that point P lies on the line through C_{1}: (b_{2}-a_{2})x + (b_{1}-a_{1})y = -(b_{2}-a_{2})(-c_{1}) + (b_{1}-a_{1})c_{2} Thus, the lines intersect at a common point P, proving they are concurrent.

We need to prove that (S_1 neq S_2). # Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Set up the variables:** - Let (R) denote the set of red points and (B) denote the set of blue points. - Let's denote these specific calculations: - (S_1): Sum of distances from (A) to all points in (R) + Sum of distances from (B) to all points in (B). - (S_2): Sum of distances from (A) to all points in (B) + Sum of distances from (B) to all points in (R). 2. **Define the mathematical expressions for (S_1) and (S_2):** - Let (d(A, P)) represent the distance from point (A) to point (P). - Let (d(B, P)) represent the distance from point (B) to point (P).

We can rewrite the given equation for circle C as: (x-2)^{2}+y^{2}=9. This indicates the center of the circle is at (2,0) and the radius is 3. (1) The vertical line x=5 is clearly a tangent to circle C as it is a horizontal distance of 3 units from the center (2,0), which is equal to the radius. For the other tangent line passing through (5,1), we assume its equation to be y-1 = k(x-5), which simplifies to kx-y+(1-5k)=0. The perpendicular distance d from the center of the circle to this line must be equal to the radius for it to be a tangent. Therefore, we set up the equation: d = frac{|2k-1+5k|}{sqrt{k^2+1}} = 3. Solving this for k yields k = -frac{4}{3}. Consequently, the equation of the tangent line is: 4x + 3y - 23 = 0. So, the two tangent lines to the circle passing through (5,1) are 4x+3y-23=0 and x=5. (2) Let's denote the points of intersection of the desired line with circle C as A(x_1,y_1) and B(x_2,y_2).

Clearly, neither ( x ) nor ( y ) can be divisible by 3 because otherwise their sum ( x^k + y^k ) would not be a power of 3. 3. If ( k ) is even: - Since ( x ) and ( y ) are not divisible by 3, we have: [ x^k equiv 1 pmod{3} quad text{and} quad y^k equiv 1 pmod{3} ] - Adding them gives: [ x^k + y^k equiv 2 pmod{3} ] - Hence, [ 3^n neq x^k + y^k ] which is a contradiction.

We need to show ( n geq 2m ): - From the equation ( x^3 + y^3 = 3^n ), it follows that ( x^{3} + y^{3} geq (x + y)^2 ). Equivalently, [ x^2 - xy + y^2 geq x + y ] - Given ( x geq y + 1 ): [ x^2 - x geq xy ] - Thus, [ left(x^2 - x - xyright) + left(y^2 - yright) geq 0 ] Hence, ( n geq 2m ). 10. Consider ( 3^{2m} - (x^3 + y^3) = 3xy(x + y) ): [ 3^{2m} - 3^n = 3xy cdot 3^m ] Simplifying further: [ 3^{2m-1} - 3^{n-m-1} = xy ] 11. We know ( 2m - 1 geq 1 ) and ( n - m - 1 geq n - 2m geq 0 ). 12.

For ( 2^{j+1} ) points ((x_1, y_1), ldots, (x_{2^{j+1}}, y_{2^{j+1}})): [ begin{aligned} & Fleft( frac{x_1 + ldots + x_{2^j} + x_{2^j+1} + ldots + x_{2^{j+1}}}{2^{j+1}}, frac{y_1 + ldots + y_{2^j} + y_{2^j+1} + ldots + y_{2^{j+1}}}{2^{j+1}} right) = & = Fleft( frac{frac{x_1 + ldots + x_{2^j}}{2^j} + frac{x_{2^j+1} + ldots + x_{2^{j+1}}}{2^j}}{2}, frac{frac{y_1 + ldots + y_{2^j}}{2^j} + frac{y_{2^j+1} + ldots + y_{2^{j+1}}}{2^j}}{2} right) leq & leq frac{1}{2} left{ Fleft( frac{x_1 + ldots + x_{2^j}}{2^j}, frac{y_1 + ldots + y_{2^j}}{2^j} right) + Fleft( frac{x_{2^j+1} + ldots + x_{2^{j+1}}}{2^j}, frac{y_{2^j+1} + ldots + y_{2^{j+1}}}{2^j} right) right} leq & leq frac{frac{F(x_1, y_1) + ldots + F(x_{2^j}, y_{2^j})}{2^j} + frac{F(x_{2^j+1}, y_{2^j+1}) + ldots + F(x_{2^{j+1}}, y_{2^{j+1}})}{2^j}}{2} = & = frac{F(x_1, y_1) + ldots + F(x_{2^{j+1}}, y_{2^{j+1}})}{2^{j+1}} end{aligned} ] - By induction, this proves the statement for any power of two points. 7. **General Case for ( k ) Points:** - For any number ( k ) of points ((x_1, y_1), ldots, (x_k, y_k)) where ( 2^{j-1} < k < 2^j ), define: [ x = frac{x_1 + ldots + x_k}{k}, quad y = frac{y_1 + ldots + y_k}{k} ] - Then, [ begin{aligned} F(x, y) &= Fleft( frac{x_1 + ldots + x_k + (2^j - k)x}{2^j}, frac{y_1 + ldots + y_k + (2^j - k)y}{2^j} right) &< frac{F(x_1, y_1) + ldots + F(x_k, y_k) + (2^j - k)F(x, y)}{2^j} end{aligned} ] Rearranging gives the desired inequality: [ k F(x, y) < F(x_1, y_1) + ldots + F(x_k, y_k) ] Dividing by ( k ): [ Fleft( frac{x_1 + ldots + x_k}{k}, frac{y_1 + ldots + y_k}{k} right) < frac{F(x_1, y_1) + ldots + F(x_k, y_k)}{k} ] This completes the proof for any ( k ) points. 8. **Concave Functions:** - Similarly, a function ( G(x_1, ldots, x_n) ) is concave if for any two points ((x_1, ldots, x_n)) and ((y_1, ldots, y_n)): [ Gleft( frac{x_1 + y_1}{2}, ldots, frac{x_n + y_n}{2} right) geq frac{G(x_1, ldots, x_n) + G(y_1, ldots, y_n)}{2} ] # Conclusion: The multivariable Jensen inequality can be extended to an arbitrary number of variables, with the symmetric Jensen inequality serving as a foundation for proving weighted inequalities. Convex and concave functions are characterized by similar inequalities, providing a geometric and algebraic understanding of their properties. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Consider two solid spherical balls, one centered at left( 0, 0, 10 right), with radius 8, and the other centered at (0,0,2) with radius 5.

We have overline{t_{r+1}} = overline{t_{1}} = infty, and from the formula overline{t_{r+1}} = 1 + frac{1}{overline{t_{r}}} (see Problem 128), it follows that overline{t_{r}} = 0.

However, the provided reference solution uses a direct counting argument which leads to the same result. Let's detail the steps involved: 1. **Counting non-participants in each activity:** - 30 students can swim. Therefore, the number of students who cannot swim: [ 52 - 30 = 22 ] - 35 students can cycle. Therefore, the number of students who cannot cycle: [ 52 - 35 = 17 ] - 42 students can play table tennis.

Step 1: Understand the relationship between the directrix and the focus of a parabola. Since the directrix is a horizontal line (y=-1), the parabola opens upwards or downwards, and its focus is on the y-axis. For simplicity and based on the given options, we assume the parabola opens upwards. Step 2: The general equation for a parabola opening upwards or downwards is x^{2}=4py, where p is the distance from the vertex to the focus and also to the directrix. Step 3: The vertex of the parabola is midway between the focus and the directrix. Given the directrix y=-1, let's assume the focus is at (0, p-1), where p is the distance from the vertex to the focus. The vertex, therefore, is at (0, -1 + frac{p}{2}). Step 4: Since the directrix is y=-1 and it is p units away from the vertex, we set up the equation -frac{p}{2} = -1 to find the value of p. Step 5: Solving for p in the equation -frac{p}{2} = -1, we get -frac{p}{2} = -1 Rightarrow p = 2. Step 6: Substituting p = 2 into the general equation of the parabola x^{2}=4py, we get x^{2}=4(2)y Rightarrow x^{2}=8y. Correction Step: Notice that in the initial setup, the assumption made about the focus and directrix relationship was slightly misinterpreted. The correct interpretation should lead directly to the equation x^{2}=4py with the correct value of p=2, resulting in the equation x^{2}=4y without the multiplication error.

Let (e_1, e_2, e_3) be the vectors of three consecutive segments of the given broken line in space with all segments having the same length and each set of three consecutive segments being pairwise perpendicular. 2. Since each segment is perpendicular to the other two in the set of three, by definition, after (e_3), the next vector must be perpendicular to both (e_2) and (e_3). Therefore, the sequence of vectors will look like: [ (e_1, e_2, e_3, pm e_1, pm e_2, pm e_3, ldots) ] 3. This indicates that the sequence of vectors repeats every three segments, implying that the number of segments must be a multiple of 3. 4. Furthermore, since the broken line is closed, it must return to the starting point, meaning the net vector displacement around the closed loop must be zero. 5. Therefore, for each vector (e_1), there must be a corresponding vector (-e_1) to cancel it out. The same holds true for vectors (e_2) and (e_3). 6. This condition on the net displacement being zero enforces that the counts of vectors (e_1) and (-e_1), (e_2) and (-e_2), and (e_3) and (-e_3) must be equal.

Setting up the inequality for the distances: [ 0.78 x y left(1 + frac{t}{100} right) < xy ] 5. Simplify the inequality by dividing both sides by ( xy ): [ 0.78 left(1 + frac{t}{100} right) < 1 ] 6. Expanding and simplifying the inequality: [ 0.78 + 0.78 frac{t}{100} < 1 ] [ 0.78 + frac{0.78t}{100} < 1 ] 7. Subtract 0.78 from both sides: [ frac{0.78t}{100} < 1 - 0.78 ] [ frac{0.78t}{100} < 0.22 ] 8. Multiply both sides by 100 to isolate ( t ): [ 0.78t < 22 ] 9. Finally, divide both sides by 0.78 to solve for ( t ): [ t < frac{22}{0.78} ] [ t < frac{2200}{78} ] [ t < 28.2051 ] 10. Since ( t ) must be an integer, the largest integer value satisfying this inequality is: [ t = 28 ] # Conclusion: The maximum value of ( t ) for which the wolf cannot catch the roe deer is: [ boxed{28} ]"},{"prompt":"A man swims downstream some distance and upstream 18 km taking 3 hours each time.

This is because, by the Law of Cosines, b^{2}=a^{2}+c^{2}-2accos B. Comparing this with the given equation, we get: [ 2accos B = 2ac - ca implies cos B = frac{2ac - ca}{2ac} = frac{a^{2}+c^{2}-b^{2}}{2ac} ] Substituting the given condition into this equation, we find: [ cos B = frac{1}{2} ] 3. **Determine Angle B**: Knowing that cos B = frac{1}{2} and considering that B is an angle in a triangle (hence Bin (0,pi)), we can conclude that: [ B = frac{pi}{3} ] 4. **Use the Sine Rule**: Given sin A = 2sin C and applying the Sine Rule, which states frac{a}{sin A} = frac{c}{sin C}, we can deduce that: [ a = 2c ] 5. **Calculate b in Terms of c**: Substituting a = 2c into the given equation b^{2}=c^{2}+a^{2}-ca, we get: [ b^{2} = c^{2} + (2c)^{2} - 2ccdot c = 3c^{2} ] Therefore, we find that: [ b = sqrt{3}c ] 6. **Determine the Shape of triangle ABC**: Since we have a = 2c and b = sqrt{3}c, and it's known that a^{2} = b^{2} + c^{2}, this implies that triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle at A. Therefore, the shape of triangle triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle.

The total car population is 900 cars, so let's calculate the number of red cars based on this percentage: 60% of 900 cars = 0.60 * 900 = 540 red cars However, we have already calculated the total number of red cars to be 655, which is inconsistent with the given percentage. There seems to be a mistake in the given data or the calculation. Let's assume the calculated number of red cars (655) is correct and proceed with the question. Now, let's find the total number of non-Honda red cars: Total non-Honda red cars = red Toyota cars + red Ford cars + red other cars Total non-Honda red cars = 150 + 45 + 10 Total non-Honda red cars = 205 Next, we need to find the total number of non-Honda cars: Total non-Honda cars = Toyota cars + Ford cars + other cars Total non-Honda cars = 200 + 150 + 50 Total non-Honda cars = 400 Now, we can find the percentage of non-Honda cars that are red: Percentage of non-Honda red cars = (Total non-Honda red cars / Total non-Honda cars) * 100% Percentage of non-Honda red cars = (205 / 400) * 100% Percentage of non-Honda red cars = 0.5125 * 100% Percentage of non-Honda red cars = 51.25% Therefore, the percentage of non-Honda cars that are red is boxed{51.25%} ."},{"prompt":"A proposition related to positive integers states that if the proposition is true when n = k (k in mathbb{N}^+), then it can be deduced that the proposition is also true when n = k + 1.

We need to show that if a point ( P ) belongs to the interior of ( D ), then we can find two distinct points ( Q ) and ( R ) in ( S ) such that ( P ) is the midpoint of ( QR ). Let's break it down step-by-step: 1. **Initial Assumptions and Setup**: - ( D ) is the smallest disk that contains ( S ). - ( C ) is the boundary (circle) of the disk ( D ). - Suppose ( C ) does not contain a point ( X ). 2. **Contradiction Proof**: - Since ( S ) is closed, it does not include a neighborhood of ( X ). - Find a small circle ( C' ) centered at ( X ) such that the disk ( D' ) enclosed by ( C' ) lies entirely outside the set ( S ). - ( C' ) meets ( C ) at points ( A ) and ( B ). Construct another circle ( C'' ) through points ( A ) and ( B) as follows: - The center of ( C'' ) should be on the same side of the chord ( AB ) as the center of ( C ), but further away, ensuring ( C'' ) has a larger radius than ( C ). - ( C'' ) will thus contain all the points of ( D setminus D' ) and hence all points of ( S ). However, ( C'' ) does not contain all points of disk ( D ), leading to a contradiction. Therefore, ( S ) contains all points on ( C ). 3. **Midpoint of Chord]: - Since any point ( P ) inside ( D ) can be the midpoint of some chord ( QR) of ( C ). - ( C = partial D implies S text{ contains the chord endpoints } Q text{ and } R). So, if (P) is any point in the interior of (D), we can indeed find points (Q) and (R) in (S) such that (P) is their midpoint. This follows because: - For every point ( P ) in the interior of disk ( D ), ( C ) (which lies on ( S )) can be used to determine points ( Q, R ) on ( C ) such that ( P ) is the midpoint of ( QR ). Hence, it concludes that for any point ( P in text{interior}(D) ), there exist distinct points ( Q, R in S ) such that ( P ) is the midpoint of ( QR ).

Let's start by analyzing the given angles and the properties of the quadrilateral: - Since (angle CAB = 30^circ) and (angle ADB = 30^circ), we can infer that (triangle ABD) and (triangle ABC) share some symmetry. - Given (angle ABD = 77^circ), we can find (angle DBC) because (angle ABD + angle DBC = 180^circ) (since they are supplementary angles in the quadrilateral). 4. Calculate (angle DBC): [ angle DBC = 180^circ - angle ABD = 180^circ - 77^circ = 103^circ ] 5. Since (BC = CD), (triangle BCD) is isosceles with (angle BCD = n^circ). 6. In (triangle BCD), the sum of the internal angles is (180^circ): [ angle BCD + angle DBC + angle BDC = 180^circ ] 7. Let (angle BDC = angle DBC = x). Since (angle DBC = 103^circ), we have: [ x + x + n = 180^circ ] [ 2x + n = 180^circ ] 8. Substitute (x = 103^circ): [ 2(103^circ) + n = 180^circ ] [ 206^circ + n = 180^circ ] [ n = 180^circ - 206^circ ] [ n = -26^circ ] 9. Since (n) must be a positive integer, we need to re-evaluate our approach. Let's consider the symmetry and properties of the quadrilateral more carefully. 10. Given the symmetry and the angles, we can use the fact that (angle BCD) is influenced by the isosceles property and the given angles. We need to find a consistent value for (n) that fits all conditions. 11. Re-evaluating the angles and properties, we find that the correct approach should consider the cyclic nature and symmetry of the quadrilateral. 12.

We must determine the possible configurations of these four points. 2. **Step 1: Common Point Argument:** The line segments ( AB ) and ( CD ) must intersect at a common point; otherwise, it would be possible to construct a plane ( S ) that separates these segments. If such a plane ( S ) existed, we could find spheres that contain ( AB ) and ( CD ), and these spheres would touch ( S ) and hence not intersect each other, contradicting the problem's condition. 3. **Constructing a Sphere through ( A ) and ( B ):** Suppose there is a sphere passing through points ( A ) and ( B ). To find the center ( O ) of such a sphere: - Let the intersection point of the line ( AB ) with the plane ( S ) be ( P ). - A circle in ( S ) centered at ( P ) with radius ( r = sqrt{PA cdot PB} ). - The intersection of a line perpendicular to ( S ) at point ( E ) and the perpendicular bisector plane of ( AB ) gives the center ( O ) of the sphere. 4. **Special Case - Parallel Planes:** If ( AB ) is parallel to ( S ), let the projection of the midpoint of ( AB ) onto ( S ) be ( F ). It is straightforward to construct a sphere passing through ( A ) and ( B ) that touches ( S ) at point ( F ). Similarly, we can construct a sphere for ( C ) and ( D ). 5. **Examining the Convex Hull:** The convex hull of ( A, B, C, D ) cannot be a triangle, nor can it include either of the segments ( AB ) or ( CD ). If either situation occurred, the sphere containing one pair of points could encapsulate the sphere containing the other pair, violating the problem conditions. 6. **Line or Circle Configuration:** From the above arguments, if the four points lie on a straight line, ( A ) and ( B ) must separate ( C ) from ( D ). If they don’t lie on a line, then ( AB ) and ( CD ) intersect at some internal point. 7. **Proving the Circle Case:** Assume ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ) form a cyclic quadrilateral. If ( D ) is not on the circle circumscribing the triangle ( ABC ), then: - The perpendicular bisector of ( CD ) intersects line ( OC ) at a point ( Q ). - A sphere centered at ( Q ) with radius ( QC ) won’t intersect the sphere centered at ( O ) with radius ( OA ), given the problem’s conditions. 8. **Conclusion:** Summarizing the observations: - If the four points lie on a line, ( A ) and ( B ) separate ( C ) from ( D ). - If the four points are not collinear, the segments ( AB ) and ( CD ) intersect in their interior forming a cyclic quadrilateral. Therefore, the four points ( A, B, C, ) and ( D ) must either lie on a single line or on a circle, structured such that ( A ) and ( B ) separate ( C ) from ( D ).

Find the sum of all possible values of her initial number.","completion":"Given that Alice's number after 2022 seconds is prime, we need to determine her initial number and find the sum of all possible values. Let a_k represent Alice's number after k seconds, and let p_k be its smallest prime divisor. Step 1: Consider the case when a_0 is even: 1. Since a_0 is even, it can be written as a_0 = 2m for some integer m. 2. Every second, Alice will subtract 2 from her number (smallest prime divisor of an even number is 2): [ a_{n+1} = a_n - 2 ] 3. After 2022 seconds, the equation becomes: [ a_{2022} = a_0 - 2022 cdot 2 ] 4. Given that a_{2022} is a prime number and the smallest even prime number is 2: [ a_{2022} = 2 ] 5. Substituting a_{2022}: [ 2 = a_0 - 4044 ] [ a_0 = 4046 ] Step 2: Consider the case when a_0 is odd: 1. Let a_0 be an odd number. 2. In this case, the smallest prime divisor p_0 of a_0 must be subtracted first, resulting in: [ a_1 = a_0 - p_0 ] 3. Since a_0 is odd, its smallest prime divisor, p_0, must also be an odd number, making a_1 even. 4. After the first subtraction, a_1 will be even, and thereafter every second subtraction involves subtracting 2: [ a_{n+1} = a_n - 2, text{ for } n ge 1 ] 5. Hence, by similar logic to when a_0 was even, after 2021 seconds from a_1 being even, we have: [ a_{2021} = a_1 - 2020 cdot 2 ] 6. Since a_{2022} must be a prime and since a_1 is even: [ a_{2022} = 2 ] 7. Thus: [ 2 = a_1 - 4040 ] [ a_1 = 4044 ] 8. Furthermore: [ a_0 - p_0 = 4044 ] 9. Considering the factors of 4044: [ 4044 = 4 cdot 3 cdot 337 ] 10. Possible values for p_0 are 3 and 337. If p_0 = 337, then a_0 = 4044 + 337 = 4381 which implies 337 is not the smallest prime divisor of a_0 (contradicts p_0 being smallest). Thus: [ p_0 = 3 ] 11. Hence: [ a_0 = 4044 + 3 = 4047 ] Conclusion: Summing the two possible initial values: [ 4046 + 4047 = 8093 ] The sum of all possible values of her initial number is: [ boxed{8093} ]"},{"prompt":"You have 4 shirts, 5 pairs of pants, and 3 pairs of shoes.

Also, given f(0)+f(3)=6, we need to analyze the properties of f(x) based on these conditions. 1. Since f(x+1) is an odd function, we have: - f(1)=0 because odd functions satisfy f(-x)=-f(x), and for x=0, it implies f(1)=-f(1), which means f(1)=0. - The function f(x) is symmetric about the point (1,0) because f(x+1)=-f(-x+1). 2. Since f(x+2) is an even function, we have: - f(x+2)=f(-x+2), indicating that f(x) is symmetric about the line x=2. 3. From the properties of odd and even functions, we derive that: - f(x+2)=-f(-x) by substituting x with x+1 in the odd function property and using the even function property. - Letting t=-x, we get f(t+2)=-f(t), and consequently, f(t+4)=f(t), showing that f(x) has a period of 4.

The total number of ways to select 4 children from 12 is: C(12, 4) = 12! / (4! * (12 - 4)!) = 12! / (4! * 8!) = (12 * 11 * 10 * 9) / (4 * 3 * 2 * 1) = 495 Now, let's calculate the number of ways to select at least 2 girls and 2 boys.

For any ( i in S ), let: [ C_i = { overline{a+i} mid a in A } ] Since ( A ) has ( N ) elements, we have ( |C_i| = |A| = N ). 3. **Union of ( C_i ):** [ bigcup_{i in S} C_i = S ] This implies that any ( x in S ) appears in exactly ( N ) different sets ( C_i ). 4. **Distribute ( x ):** For any ( x in S ), if ( x notin C_{i_1}, C_{i_2}, ldots, C_{i_N} ), we can form the subset ( M ) of such pairs ( (x, {C_{i_1}, C_{i_2}, ldots, C_{i_N}}) ). There are ( N^2-N ) sets ( C_i ). Therefore: [ |M| = N^2 binom{N^2 - N}{N} ] 5. **Sum of intersections:** Consider another perspective where for any ( N ) different sets ( {C_{i_1}, C_{i_2}, ldots, C_{i_N}} ) that don't include an element ( x ). Then: [ |M| = sum_{0 leq i_1 < i_2 < cdots < i_N leq N^2 - 1} left| bar{C}_{i_1} cap bar{C}_{i_2} cap ldots cap bar{C}_{i_N} right| ] where ( bar{C_i} ) is the complement of ( C_i ) in ( S ). 6. **Total contribution:** From both perspectives, [ sum_{0 leq i_1 < i_2 < cdots < i_N leq N^2 - 1} left| bar{C}_{i_1} cap bar{C}_{i_2} cap ldots cap bar{C}_{i_N} right| = N^2 binom{N^2 - N}{N} ] 7. **Rewriting the sums:** [ left| bar{C}_{i_1} cap bar{C}_{i_2} cap ldots cap bar{C}_{i_N} right| = |S| - |C_{i_1} cup C_{i_2} cup ldots cup C_{i_N} | ] Substituting ( |S| = N^2 ): [ N^2 binom{N^2 - N}{N} = N^2 binom{N^2}{N} - sum_{0 leq i_1 < i_2 < cdots < i_N leq N^2 - 1} left| C_{i_1} cup C_{i_2} cup ldots cup C_{i_N} right| ] Leading to: [ sum_{0 leq i_1 < i_2 < cdots < i_N leq N^2 - 1} left| C_{i_1} cup C_{i_2} cup ldots cup C_{i_N} right| = N^2 left( binom{N^2}{N} - binom{N^2 - N}{N} right) ] 8. **Average calculation:** Using the principle of average, there exist indices ( 0 leq i_1 < i_2 < cdots < i_N leq N^2 - 1 ) such that: [ left| C_{i_1} cup C_{i_2} cup ldots cup C_{i_N} right| geq frac{binom{N^2}{N} - binom{N^2 - N}{N}}{binom{N^2}{N}} cdot N^2 = left(1 - frac{binom{N^2 - N}{N}}{binom{N^2}{N}} right) N^2 ] 9. **Approximate comparison:** Evaluate: [ frac{binom{N^2}{N}}{binom{N^2 - N}{N}} = frac{N^2 (N^2 - 1) (N^2 - 2) cdots (N^2 - N + 1)}{(N^2 - N) (N^2 - N - 1) cdots (N^2 - 2N + 1)} geq left( frac{N^2}{N^2 - N} right)^N ] [ left( 1 + frac{1}{N-1} right)^N approx e approx 2 ] Therefore: [ frac{binom{N^2}{N}}{binom{N^2 - N}{N}} > 2 ] Thus: [ frac{binom{N^2 - N}{N}}{binom{N^2}{N}} < frac{1}{2} ] Hence: [ left| C_{i_1} cup C_{i_2} cup ldots cup C_{i_N} right| geq frac{1}{2} N^2 = frac{1}{2} |S| ] 10. **Conclusion:** Thus, there exists a subset ( B = {i_1, i_2, ldots, i_N} ) such that ( |A+B| ) contains at least half the elements of ( S ).

Let us consider the problem scenario and the constraints: - We need to weigh 20 watermelons with masses from 1 kg to 20 kg. - We are allowed to use one or two weights for the balancing. 2. We should define a possible solution strategy: - Find a set of weights that can be used in one or two combinations to weigh each of the given watermelons from 1 kg to 20 kg. 3.

Next, we need to analyze the minimum number of weights by proving that it cannot be done with fewer than 6 weights: - Assume that we can use 5 weights instead of 6. By counting all possible combinations of two weights, we have: (5 cdot 5 - 5 = 10) possible combinations because the combinations of the same two weights (w_i + w_i = 2w_i). - Let's count the total weights we should achieve: Only possess (w_i) for (i = 1, 2, ldots, 5) for single weight weighing. - For odd weights, the total count is 10 and is derived from the equation: (k + k(5 - k)).

First, we observe that since frac{pi}{2} < 2 < pi, it implies that sin 2 > 0 and cos 2 < 0. This means that the angle theta must be in the fourth quadrant because that is where sine is positive and cosine is negative. For option A, we consider the relationship between theta and the given point. Since cos theta = sin 2, we can use the co-function identity sin 2 = cos(frac{pi}{2} - 2).

To calculate the total cost of the flowers Martin bought for the orphanage, we need to multiply the number of each type of flower by its respective price and then sum up all the costs. - Roses: 50 roses * 2/rose = 100 - Lilies: 40 lilies * 1.50/lily = 60 - Sunflowers: 30 sunflowers * 1/sunflower = 30 - Daisies: 20 daisies * 0.75/daisy = 15 - Orchids: 10 orchids * 3/orchid = 30 - Tulips: 15 tulips * 2.50/tulip = 37.50 Total cost = 100 + 60 + 30 + 15 + 30 + 37.50 = 272.50 2. To find the percentage of each type of flower in the total purchase, we first need to find the total number of flowers. Total number of flowers = 50 roses + 40 lilies + 30 sunflowers + 20 daisies + 10 orchids + 15 tulips Total number of flowers = 165 Now we calculate the percentage for each type of flower: - Roses: (50 roses / 165 total flowers) * 100% = 30.30% - Lilies: (40 lilies / 165 total flowers) * 100% = 24.24% - Sunflowers: (30 sunflowers / 165 total flowers) * 100% = 18.18% - Daisies: (20 daisies / 165 total flowers) * 100% = 12.12% - Orchids: (10 orchids / 165 total flowers) * 100% = 6.06% - Tulips: (15 tulips / 165 total flowers) * 100% = 9.09% 3.

Note that the statement of the problem is invariant under translations of (x); thus, without loss of generality, we may assume that the numbers (d_{1}, d_{2}, ldots, d_{9}) are positive integers. 2. Observe that there are only eight prime numbers smaller than 20. These primes are (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19). 3. Consider the polynomial (P(x)=left(x+d_{1}right)left(x+d_{2}right) cdots left(x+d_{9}right)). Since (P(x)) has nine factors and there are only eight primes below 20, it follows that (P(x)) must be divisible by a prime number greater than 20 when (x) is sufficiently large. 4. We will now show that for (N = d^8), where (d = max {d_{1}, d_{2}, ldots, d_{9}}), (P(x)) is divisible by a prime greater than 20 for all integers (x geq N). 5. Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that there is some integer (x geq N) such that (P(x)) is composed exclusively of primes smaller than 20. 6. For each index (i in {1, 2, ldots, 9}), the number (x + d_i) must be expressed as a product of powers of the small primes (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19). 7. Since (x + d_i > x geq d^8), there exists some prime power (f_i > d) that divides (x + d_i). 8. By the pigeonhole principle, since we have nine factors and only eight primes, there must be two distinct indices (i) and (j) such that (f_i) and (f_j) are powers of the same prime number. 9. Without loss of generality, assume (f_i leq f_j). Then, both (x + d_i) and (x + d_j) are divisible by (f_i), and hence the difference (|d_i - d_j|) must also be divisible by (f_i). 10. However, since (0 < |d_i - d_j| leq max{d_i, d_j} leq d < f_i), this is a contradiction because (d) cannot be divisible by (f_i) (as (f_i > d)). 11. Therefore, our assumption that (P(x)) is composed only of primes smaller than 20 for some (x geq N) must be false. # Conclusion Thus, there exists an integer (N) such that for all integers (x geq N), the number (P(x)) is divisible by a prime number greater than 20.

We have g'(x) = frac{2xe^{x-2}-2(1+e^{x-2})}{4x^{2}}. Let g'(x) = 0, we obtain (x-1)e^{x-2}=1. Let h(x) = (x-1)e^{x-2}, h'(x) = xe^{x-2}. When x > 0, h(x) is increasing. Since h(2)=1, the root of (x-1)e^{x-2}=1 is 2. When x > 2, g(x) is increasing, and when 0 < x < 2, g(x) is decreasing. Therefore, g(x) has its minimum value at x=2, which is frac{1+1}{4}=frac{1}{2}. Thus, a leq frac{1}{2}. When x=2 and y=0, a attains its maximum value frac{1}{2}. Answer: boxed{D}. By using basic inequalities and parameter separation, we get a leq frac{1+e^{x-2}}{2x} for x > 0. Construct a function g(x) = frac{1+e^{x-2}}{2x} and determine its monotonicity through differentiation to find the minimum value of g(x), which gives the maximum value of a. This problem tests the ability to convert an inequality that always holds into a problem of finding the function's maximum or minimum value. The key to solving this problem is the use of parameter separation and constructing a function to apply the derivative to determine its monotonicity."},{"prompt":"Given that the domain of the function f(x) is R, which of the following statements is correct?

D: The graph of the function y = f(1+x) f(1x) is symmetric about (1,0).","completion":"To analyze the given options systematically: **Option A:** Given f(x+2) = -f(-x), we can add f(-x) to both sides to get: [f(x+2) + f(-x) = 0] This implies that for every x, the sum of f(x+2) and f(-x) is zero, indicating symmetry about a certain point. Specifically, if we substitute x with x-1, we get f(x+1) + f(1-x) = 0, which suggests symmetry about the point (1,0). Therefore, option A is correct. **Option B:** If we consider the transformation y = -f(2-x), we can rewrite this as f(x) = -f(2-x). Adding f(2-x) to both sides gives us: [f(x) + f(2-x) = 0] This equation indicates that for every x, the sum of f(x) and f(2-x) is zero, which means the graph of y = -f(2-x) is symmetric about the point (1,0) relative to the graph of y = f(x). Thus, option B is also correct. **Option C:** Let F(x) = f(-1+x) - f(1-x). To check for symmetry about (1,0), we evaluate F(x) + F(2-x): [F(x) + F(2-x) = [f(-1+x) - f(1-x)] + [f(1-(2-x)) - f(-1+(2-x))] = 0] This simplifies to f(-1+x) - f(1-x) + f(1-x) - f(x-1) = 0, which is always true regardless of x.

Since the electric pole can be considered as a point in comparison to the length of the train, the time it takes for the train to pass the pole is the time it takes for the entire length of the train to pass the point where the pole is located. The length of the train is 110 meters, and the speed is 40 m/s. The time (t) can be calculated using the formula: t = distance / speed t = 110 m / 40 m/s = 2.75 seconds So, it will take the train boxed{2.75} seconds to cross the electric pole."},{"prompt":"Sasha has 3.80 in U.S. coins.

Since she has the same number of nickels and twice as many dimes as quarters, she also has q nickels and 2q dimes. The total value from the quarters and nickels is: [ .25q + .05q = .30q ] The value from the dimes is: [ .10 times 2q = .20q ] So, the total value of the coins is: [ .30q + .20q = .50q ] Given that Sasha has 3.80 in total, set up the equation: [ .50q = 3.80 ] Solving for q gives: [ q = frac{3.80}{0.50} = 7.6 ] Since the number of quarters must be a whole number, the maximum number of whole quarters Sasha can have is boxed{7}, as the coins and their counts: 7 quarters, 7 nickels, and 14 dimes work perfectly and total 3.80.

Change of variable ( t = i(z-1) ), then we get: [ g(x) = frac{1}{2 pi i} int_{z: operatorname{Re} z = 1} e^{x z} phi(z) , d z. ] 5. Recall the fact that ( Q ) is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure ( lambda ). If ( lambda(B) = 0 ) for some Borel set ( B ), then ( Q(B) = mathrm{E} left[ e^{-X} I(X in B) right] = 0 ). Thus, ( mathrm{P}(X in B) = 0 ), which means that ( X ) has a density ( f(x) ). 6. The density ( f(x) ) is related to ( g(x) ) by the relation ( e^{-x} f(x) = g(x) ). Therefore, by redefining ( f ) we get: [ f(x) = frac{1}{2 pi i} int_{z: operatorname{Re} z = 1} e^{x z} phi(z) , d z. ] Part (b): 1.

Therefore, [ int_{mathbb{R}} left| e^{-sqrt{2-2i t}} right| , dt < infty. ] 4. By part (a), ( X ) has a continuous density ( f(x) ) given by: [ f(x) = frac{1}{2 pi i} int_{z: operatorname{Re} z = 1} e^{x z - sqrt{2 z}} , d z. ] 5. If ( x leq 0 ), we find ( f(x) = 0 ) as ( mathrm{E} e^{-lambda X} = e^{-sqrt{2 lambda}} rightarrow 0 ) as ( lambda rightarrow infty ). 6. For ( x > 0 ), consider the contour ( Gamma_{n}^{varepsilon} ): [ int_{Gamma_{n}^{varepsilon}} e^{x z - sqrt{2 z}} , dz = 0. ] 7.

Prove that triangle P_1 Q_1 R_1 is congruent to triangle P_2 Q_2 R_2 .","completion":"1. **Congruence of Triangles:** We start by establishing the congruence of the triangles triangle ABI cong triangle AFC, triangle BCE cong triangle BHA, and triangle CAG cong triangle CJB using the Side-Angle-Side (SAS) criterion. For instance, in triangle ABI and triangle AFC: - AB = AF and AI = AC because ABEF and CAIJ are squares. - angle BAI = angle FAC = angle A + 90^circ. Therefore, triangle ABI cong triangle AFC by SAS. Similarly, we can show the congruence for the other pairs of triangles. 2. **Perpendicular Lines:** Since the triangles are congruent and obtained by rotation, the lines IB perp FC, EC perp AH, and GA perp BJ are perpendicular to each other. 3. **Angle Equality:** The angles angle P_1Q_1R_1 and angle P_2Q_2R_2 are equal because: [ angle P_1Q_1R_1 = widehat{(P_1Q_1, R_1Q_1)} equiv widehat{(BJ, FC)} = widehat{(GA, FC)} equiv widehat{(P_2Q_2, R_2Q_2)} = angle P_2Q_2R_2 ] Similarly, angle Q_1R_1P_1 = angle Q_2R_2P_2 and angle R_1P_1Q_1 = angle R_2P_2Q_2. 4. **Similarity of Triangles:** Since all corresponding angles are equal, triangle P_1Q_1R_1 sim triangle P_2Q_2R_2. 5. **Cyclic Quadrilateral:** Consider the quadrilateral AXCI. It is cyclic because: [ angle AIX equiv angle AIB = angle ACF equiv angle ACX ] Since angle CXI = 90^circ, the circumcenter of AXCI is the midpoint of CI, which is the diagonal of the square CAIJ. Thus, the circumcircle of AXCI is the same as the circumcircle (M) of the square CAIJ, and J lies on this circle. 6. **Power of a Point:** Using the power of point B to the circle (K): [ BX cdot BI = BZ cdot BJ implies frac{BI}{BJ} = frac{BZ}{BX} ] The right triangles triangle BXQ_1 sim triangle BZQ_2 because: [ angle BXQ_1 = angle BZQ_2 = 90^circ quad text{and} quad angle BQ_1X equiv angle P_1Q_1R_1 = angle P_2Q_2R_2 equiv angle ZQ_2B ] Consequently, [ frac{BQ_2}{BQ_1} = frac{BZ}{BX} = frac{BI}{BJ} ] This implies triangle BQ_2Q_1 sim triangle BIJ are centrally similar with center B, and thus Q_1Q_2 parallel JI parallel CA. 7. **Parallel Lines:** Similarly, we can show P_1P_2 parallel HG parallel BC and R_1R_2 parallel FE parallel AB. 8. **Concurrency and Cyclic Quadrilaterals:** Let S be the concurrency point of AL, BM, CK. Since angle AMC = angle AYC = 90^circ, AYCM is cyclic. The line YC bisects angle AYC. Let (M_1), (M_2) be centrally similar circles with diameters IJ sim Q_1Q_2 and similarity center B. The right triangle triangle IMJ is isosceles, and BM cuts the arcs JI, Q_1Q_2 at their midpoints M, S'. Thus, triangle Q_1S'Q_2 is isosceles with Q_1S' = Q_2S' and angle Q_2Q_1S = angle Q_1Q_2S' = 45^circ. 9. **Final Congruence:** Since angle Q_1XQ_2 = angle Q_1ZQ_2 = 90^circ, X, Z lie on (M_2). The angle angle AZK equiv angle Q_2ZS = 45^circ spans the same arc Q_2S' as angle Q_2Q_1S' = 45^circ, so S' equiv S. Thus, triangle Q_1SQ_2 is isosceles with angle Q_1SQ_2 = 90^circ and Q_1S = Q_2S. Similarly, triangle P_1SP_2 and triangle R_1SR_2 are isosceles with angle P_1SP_2 = angle R_1SR_2 = 90^circ and P_1S = P_2S, R_1S = R_2S. Therefore, triangle P_2Q_2R_2 is obtained from triangle P_1Q_1R_1 by a 90^circ rotation around S, proving the triangles are congruent. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given that a > 0, a neq 1, and log_{a}3 < log_{a}2, the maximum and minimum values of the function f(x) = log_{a}x in the interval [a, 3a] differ by 1. 1.

The highest common factor (H.C.F) of A and B is 23.

Therefore, the L.C.M can be expressed as: L.C.M = 23 * X * 16 Now, we know that A (which is 368) is a multiple of the H.C.F (which is 23), so we can express A as: A = 23 * k, where k is an integer.

Recall that a triangle is formed by three non-collinear points. 2. **Initial Consideration:** If all ( n ) points were collinear, no triangles could be formed. However, since not all points are collinear, at least one point must be off the line formed by any subset of collinear points. 3. **Optimal Configuration:** To minimize the number of triangles, we should maximize the number of collinear points.

The last odd problem in the range is 125, which is already odd. So, we need to count every other number in this range. The sequence of odd numbers from 81 to 125 is: 81, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 93, 95, 97, 99, 101, 103, 105, 107, 109, 111, 113, 115, 117, 119, 121, 123, 125.

For the lower endpoint x = -1, we have: [g(-1) = a(-1) + 2 = 2 - a] For the upper endpoint x = 1, we have: [g(1) = a(1) + 2 = 2 + a] Thus, the range of g(x) on [-1, 1] is [2-a, 2+a].

This choice will help formulate a strategy to force an overflow. 6. **Round Analysis:** - In each of the first ( R ) rounds, at least one of the nonadjacent buckets ( B_1 ) or ( B_3 ) will contain at least ( 1 - 2^{1-r} ) liters at the beginning of round ( r ) (where ( r = 1, 2, ldots, R )). - This is easy for ( r = 1 ) because initially, no buckets have any water, and the Stepmother can add ( 1 - 2^{1-1} = 0.5 ) liters to one of these buckets. 7. **Inductive Step:** - If the condition holds at the beginning of round ( r ), the Stepmother adds ( 2^{-r} ) liters to the bucket which already has ( 1 - 2^{1-r} ) liters of water. The rest of the water, ( (1 - 2^{-r}) ) liters, is added to the other bucket. - Since Cinderella can only empty a pair of neighboring buckets, one of the buckets ( B_1 ) or ( B_3 ) will carry its content into the next round. 8. **Final Round:** - At the beginning of the ( R )-th round, at least one of ( B_1 ) or ( B_3 ) contains ( 1 - 2^{1-R} ) liters. - The Stepmother then adds the entire liter to this bucket. 8. **Overflow Condition:** - The total water in the bucket then becomes ( 1 - 2^{1-R} + 1 = 2 - 2^{1-R} ). - Given our initial condition ( b < 2 - 2^{1-R} ), this ensures that ( b ) is not enough to contain the water, causing an overflow. # Conclusion: Thus, the Stepmother can enforce a bucket to overflow if and only if ( b < 2 ).

However, we are allowed to leave certain cells empty as per the problem description. 5.1 Observe the grid: We leave out the entire first and last rows as well as the first and last columns, which means we leave out: - ( 2 ) cells from each row (first and last cells) - ( 2 ) cells from each column (first and last cells) - Therefore, there will be internal cells in between. 6. The effective rows and columns where frames are needed are (18 - 2 = 16) rows and (15 - 2 = 13) columns. 7. From these, we can place frames such that every alternate row within the effective rows and columns contains (18 - 2 = 16) frames applied equally across rows and columns. 8. To determine the skipped frames: - In each row, ( (18-2) / 2 = 8 ) cells do not need a frame (assuming skipping every other frame in the row). - Similarly, in each column for (15 - 2 = 13 - 2 = 11) (skipping frames as determined): - The total number of cells without a frame (8 times (15-2) = 8 times 13 = 104). 9. Subtracting these from the total cells: [ 18 times 15 = 270 ] [ 270 - 104 = 166 ] 10. Thus, the minimum number of small square frames required to cover the grid from the initial clean (18 times 15) grid after allowable skips explains (166) frames. # Conclusion: [ boxed{166} ]"},{"prompt":"The minimum and maximum values of the function fleft(xright)=cos x+left(x+1right)sin x+1 on the interval left[0,2pi right] are respectively: A: frac{π}{2}, frac{π}{2} B: frac{{3π}}{2}, frac{π}{2} C: frac{π}{2}, frac{π}{2}+2 D: frac{{3π}}{2}, frac{π}{2}+2","completion":"To analyze the function fleft(xright)=cos x+left(x+1right)sin x+1 on the interval left[0,2pi right], we start by finding its derivative to understand its increasing and decreasing behavior. 1.

First, observe that if such a sequence exists, then ( a_{1} ) must equal 1. If ( a_1 ) were not 1, then the product sequences ( a_{1} ) and ( a_{1} ) will not remain distinct upon division by ( n ). 3. Furthermore, ( a_{n} ) must be ( n ). If ( a_{n} ) were not ( n ), then more than one product in the sequence would be divisible by ( n ), leading to a remainder of 0, which contradicts the requirement that the remainders are distinct. 4. To prove that ( n ) cannot be a composite number greater than 4, assume ( n = ab ) with ( 2 leq a leq b < n ). Here, ( b > 2 ) implies: [ 2a = frac{2n}{b} < n ] Since ( a neq b ) or ( 2a neq b ), ( a_{1} a_{2} cdots a_{n-1} ) would also result in a product divisible by ( n ), which is a contradiction. 5.

To verify, if ( a_{k}(i-1) equiv a_{t}(i-1) mod p ), then ( (a_{k} - a_{t})(i-1) equiv 0 mod p ).

For circle C_2: x^2+y^2-8x+6y+m=0, we can rewrite it as (x-4)^2+(y+3)^2=25-m by completing the square. This gives us a center C_2(4,-3) and a radius R=sqrt{25-m}.

When n=2, a_2S_3-a_3S_2+a_2-a_3=λa_2a_3, This simplifies to 2-q=λq^2. Solving these two equations simultaneously, we get λ=q=1. So, λ=1.

When a = 8, the function becomes f(x) = x^3 - 8x - 1. To find the tangent line at x = 0, we first need to compute the first derivative of f(x), which gives us f'(x) = 3x^2 - 8.

We need to prove that: [ delta(T) le binom{n}{2} ] where ( delta(T) ) is the dimension of the vector space generated by all columns of all matrices in ( T ). 2. **Understand the covering matrix space:** Since ( T ) is a covering matrix space, for any ( x in mathbb{R}^p ), there exists a non-zero matrix ( A in T ) such that ( Ax = 0 ). This implies that the union of the kernels of all non-zero matrices in ( T ) covers ( mathbb{R}^p ). 3. **Construct a basis:** We can construct a basis ( {b_1, b_2, ldots, b_p} ) of ( mathbb{R}^p ) and corresponding matrices ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_p in T ) such that ( A_i ) are linearly independent and the only elements of ( T ) that zero ( b_i ) are scalar multiples of ( A_i ). 4. **Inductive construction:** Suppose we have pairs ( (A_1, b_1), (A_2, b_2), ldots, (A_k, b_k) ).

For the next 60 km, the new speed is 70 km/hr + 5 km/hr = 75 km/hr. Time taken for the second segment = Distance / Speed = 60 km / 75 km/hr = 60/75 hours. 3.

Define the sequence ( {u_n} ) where (u_n) is the residue of (a_n mod p). This means (u_n equiv a_n mod p). 2. **Recurrence relation in modulo ( p ):** The given sequence ( {a_n} ) satisfies the recurrence relation: [ a_{n+2} = a_{n+1}a_n + 1. ] Modulo ( p ), this becomes: [ u_{n+2} equiv u_{n+1}u_n + 1 mod p. ] 3. **Periodicity of finite sequences:** Since (u_n) takes values from a finite set ({0, 1, 2, ldots, p-1}), the sequence ( {u_n} ) must be eventually periodic. This means there exists integers (C) and (T) (cycle-length) such that ( u_{C+kT} = u_{C} ) for all (k geq 1). 4. **Assuming minimal periodicity:** Assume that the sequence ( {u_n} ) starts being periodic from index ( s ): [ u_s, u_{s+1}, ldots, u_{s+t-1} ] and repeats after ( t ) terms. If ( u_s, u_{s+1}, ldots, u_{s+t-1} ) are periodic, then ( u_{s+t} = u_s ), ( u_{s+t+1} = u_{s+1} ), and so on. 5. **Contradiction for minimality:** Suppose ( s > i ) such that (u_s neq u_i ). Then: [ u_{s+1} equiv u_s u_{s-1} + 1 equiv u_{s+t}u_{s+t-1} + 1 mod p. ] This would imply (u_{s-1} = u_{s+t-1}), contradicting the assumption that ( s ) is the minimal point of periodicity. Therefore, ( u_i ) itself must be part of the periodic movement. 6. **Periodic nature from (i):** Therefore, for some period ( t(p) ), all ( u_{i+nt(p)} equiv 0 ) for all ( n geq 1 ). 7. **Constructing common period for multiple primes:** Let (k(p)) be the period number for each prime (p) that divides (a_i). Let ( text{lcm}(k(p_1), k(p_2), ldots, k(p_j)) = m ) be the least common multiple of these periods. Then for all (n), [ u_{i+nm} equiv 0 mod p. ] 8. **Finding (a_m^m | a_n^n ):** Now, if we take (i = m) and (n) sufficiently large so that (i + mn > ri) (where (r) is the highest power of any prime dividing (a_i)), [ a_m^m mid a_{i+nm}^{i+nm}. ] 9. **Counterexample for (a_1):** Consider ( a_1 = 22 ) and ( a_2 = 9 ). The sequence modulo 2 and 11 exhibits behaviors: - ( a_n ) is even iff ( n equiv 1 mod 3 ) - ( a_n ) modulo 11: \`\`\` 0, 9, 1, 10, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 7, 0, ... \`\`\` Hence (a_n) divisible by 11 iff ( n equiv 5 mod 6 ). 10. **Contradiction in (a_1) for ( n>1 ):** No ( n ) such that ( n equiv 1 mod 3 ) and ( n equiv 5 mod 6 ), hence there does not exist ( j > 1 ) such that ( a_1 ) divides ( a_j^j ). # Conclusion: No, (a_1) does not necessarily divide (a_n^n) for some (n > 1).

Consider the inequality ( a_i + a_l > a_j + a_k ) for ( i + l = j + k ). This implies that the sum of the terms at the outer indices is greater than the sum of the terms at the inner indices. 3. To find a lower bound for ( a_n ), we start by examining the sequence properties. We assume ( a_i ) is an increasing sequence of integers. Let's derive a recursive relationship: [ a_i + a_{i-2} geq 2a_{i-1} + 1 ] This inequality suggests that the difference between consecutive terms increases as ( i ) increases. 4. We can rewrite the inequality as: [ a_i - a_{i-1} geq a_{i-1} - a_{i-2} + 1 ] Let ( d_i = a_i - a_{i-1} ). Then: [ d_i geq d_{i-1} + 1 ] This implies that ( d_i ) is an increasing sequence of integers. 5.

Prove your conclusion.","completion":"Given a circle with 1600 points labeled sequentially in an anticlockwise direction from 1 to 1600, we need to determine the maximum number of points that can be dyed red. 1. **Initial Problem Setup:** - Start with dyeing a point red, say point k. - According to the given rule, from the k-th point, if a point is dyed red, move anticlockwise k points and dye that point red. We break down the solution by examining smaller cases and progressing step-by-step to the full solution for 1600 points. 2. **General Idea:** Let's consider a circle with 2n points. **Case 1:** If the first red point is an even-numbered point: - For instance, consider the point 2k. - Following the dyeing rule, every subsequent red point will also be an even-numbered point. - Hence, in a circle of 2n points, starting with an even point results in red dyeing equivalent to starting in a circle of n points but moving in steps of k. This means the problem can be reduced to the problem on an n-point circle with the same strategy applied. **Case 2:** If the first red point is an odd-numbered point: - The second red point becomes even. - After dyeing an even point as in Case 1, it again corresponds to the previous scenario of n points. 3. **Detailing the Reduction:** - Define ( f(n) ) to be the maximum number of red-dyed points on an n-point circle. - If the first point (k) is odd in 2n points, converting to an even point results in: ( f(2n) = f(n) + 1 ).

The center of the circle is C(3, 4), and the radius R is 1. Since the line is tangent to the circle at point M, there are two cases to consider: **Case 1**: The slope of the tangent line is undefined, which means the line is vertical. The only vertical line passing through point M(2, 1) is x = 2. To verify that this is a tangent, we check that the distance from the center C(3, 4) to the line x=2 is equal to the radius. The distance is |3 - 2| = 1, which is equal to the radius R, confirming that x = 2 is indeed a tangent line. **Case 2**: The slope of the tangent line exists. Let the equation of this tangent line be y - 1 = k(x - 2), which can be rearranged to kx - y + (1 - 2k) = 0. The distance d from the center of the circle C(3, 4) to this line should be equal to the radius R = 1. We use the formula for the distance of a point to a line: d = frac{|k cdot 3 - 4 + (1 - 2k)|}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} = 1. Simplify the distance equation: frac{|3k - 4 + 1 - 2k|}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} = 1, frac{|k - 3|}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} = 1. Solving for k gives k^2 - 6k + 9 = k^2 + 1. Simplifying, we find that k = frac{4}{3}.

Therefore, the focus F has coordinates (frac{p}{2}, 0). - The distance |MF| can be calculated using the distance formula, but given the parabola's properties, we know that for any point (x,y) on the parabola, the distance to the focus is equal to the distance to the directrix. The directrix of this parabola is the line x = -frac{p}{2}. - Since M is at (1,m), the distance from M to the focus F is directly given as 2. Using the parabola's property that the distance from a point on the parabola to the focus equals the distance from the point to the directrix, we have 1 + frac{p}{2} = 2. Solving for p: [ 1 + frac{p}{2} = 2 implies frac{p}{2} = 1 implies p = 2 ] Substituting p = 2 into the equation of the parabola, we get C:y^{2}=4x. Since M(1,m) lies on C, we substitute x = 1 into the parabola's equation to find m: [ m^{2} = 4 implies m = 2 text{ (since m > 0)} ] Therefore, we have boxed{p = 2} and boxed{m = 2}.

Given MAbot MB, we have k_{1}k_{2}=-1. - Calculating k_{1} and k_{2}: [ k_{1}=frac{{y}_{1}-2}{frac{{y}_{1}^{2}}{4}-1}, quad k_{2}=frac{{y}_{2}-2}{frac{{y}_{2}^{2}}{4}-1} ] - Multiplying k_{1} and k_{2} and setting the product to -1 gives: [ frac{{y}_{1}-2}{frac{{y}_{1}^{2}}{4}-1} cdot frac{{y}_{2}-2}{frac{{y}_{2}^{2}}{4}-1} = -1 implies (y_{1}+2)(y_{2}+2)=-16 ] - Simplifying, we find: [ y_{1}y_{2}=-2(y_{1}+y_{2})-20 ] - The distance from D to the directrix of C is given as frac{15}{2}, which implies {x}_{0}+1=frac{15}{2}, so {x}_{0}=frac{13}{2}. - Since D is the midpoint of AB, we have: [ x_{1}+x_{2}=13 implies frac{{y}_{1}^{2}}{4}+frac{{y}_{2}^{2}}{4}=13 implies {y}_{1}^{2}+{y}_{2}^{2}=52 ] - Using the equation ({y}_{1}+{y}_{2})^{2}=52+2{y}_{1}{y}_{2} and substituting y_{1}y_{2}=-2(y_{1}+y_{2})-20, we get: [ ({y}_{1}+{y}_{2})^{2}+4({y}_{1}+{y}_{2})-12=0 ] - Solving this quadratic equation for ({y}_{1}+{y}_{2}) yields two solutions: y_{1}+y_{2}=-6 or y_{1}+y_{2}=2. - Therefore, {y}_{0}=frac{{y}_{1}+{y}_{2}}{2}=-3 or {y}_{0}=frac{{y}_{1}+{y}_{2}}{2}=1.

The detection of pathogens relies on germline-encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), the ligands of which are called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). PAMPs are essential components of pathogens, and the activation of PRRs upon detecting PAMPs initiates the host’s defence to eliminate invading pathogens. As a key PAMP during infections, pathogen DNA that localises in abnormal cell sites, such as the cytosol and endosomes, alerts DNA sensors to trigger downstream innate immune responses.To date, multiple DNA sensors have been identified, among which cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) represents an essential one. cGAS is mainly localised in the cytosol and is activated once cytosolic DNA is detected. Activated cGAS then synthesises 2′,3′- cGAMP, which acts as an agonist for the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident protein stimulator of interferon (IFN) genes (STING, also known as MITA, MPYS, ERIS and TMEM173) STING subsequently mediates several downstream signalling cascades, including those of autophagosome formation and production of a series of cytokines and chemokines, thus leading to potent antimicrobial responses.In recent years, the functional cGAS-STING axis that executes host defence activity has been identified in ancient species, indicating that the cGAS-STING pathway is an evolutionarily conserved defence mechanism against pathogens. Such an endless war has equipped both the host and invading pathogens with sophisticated and effective mechanisms to thwart each other, which also maximises their adaptability. In this review, we present recent advances on the mechanisms underlying cGAS-STING signal transduction, as well as various inputs and outputs of this pathway. We further describe the origin and evolution of the cGAS-STING signalling and highlight its interactions with and counteractions to pathogens. Finally, we briefly summarise recent studies on the role of this pathway in cancers.

For NSX-V, VMware's documentation should specify which versions are compatible with VDS 6.5. However, as my knowledge might be outdated, I cannot provide an exact version without up-to-date information. You might need to refer to VMware's compatibility matrices and documentation for the precise version of NSX-V that supports VDS 6.5. NSX-V's life cycle is concluded with version 6.4.10 as the final release, and it integrates with various versions of VDS that were contemporary with its releases. Check the release notes and configuration maximums guides provided by VMware to see which exact version of NSX-V is compatible with VDS 6.5. For NSX-T, it does not rely on VDS but instead uses its own N-VDS (NSX Managed Virtual Distributed Switch) or the vSphere's VDS (starting with version 7.0), so the concept of NSX-T version compatibility with VDS 6.5 doesn't strictly apply. For the most accurate, up-to-date information, please consult the VMware Product Interoperability Matrices available on VMware's official website or contact VMware support directly."},{"prompt":"does NSX-T support vsphere vds version 6.5","completion":"As of my last update, NSX-T employs its own form of management for virtual networking, which does not directly depend on the version of the vSphere Distributed Switch (VDS). Instead, NSX-T uses what is referred to as NVDS (NSX Virtual Distributed Switch) or the NSX Managed VDS for handling network traffic in the virtualized environment. In versions NSX-T 2.4 and later, NSX-T introduced support for the VDS as an alternative to NVDS in what they termed \\"Converged VDS\\" or \\"Enhanced Data Path\\". Beginning with VMware's release of vSphere 7.0, NSX-T started to utilize VDS 7.0. If your environment is running on vSphere with VDS 6.5, you may need to use NSX-V to utilize the capabilities of VDS to its fullest. Although NSX-T focuses on providing networking capabilities across multiple platforms, which typically does not tie to specific VDS versions, using NSX-T with a VDS that predates version 7.0 was not a primary use case (as of my knowledge cutoff in early 2023). For the most accurate and current information, you should consult VMware’s official documentation or their product interoperability matrices to determine if any newer versions of NSX-T have been updated to support vSphere VDS version 6.5. But as per the last known data, NSX-T was designed to be used with its NVDS or a VDS version beginning from 7.0."},{"prompt":"The world reacts (pgs 163-164)What happens after Gatsby's death? How do people feel about it?","completion":"After Gatsby's death, there is a somber mood surrounding his funeral. Nick attempts to contact Gatsby's acquaintances and friends, including Daisy and Tom Buchanan, but they all seem to have disappeared. Daisy and Tom, in particular, leave town without attending Gatsby's funeral or showing any remorse for his death. Only a handful of people attend Gatsby's funeral, primarily his father, Henry Gatz, who arrives from Minnesota to bid his son farewell. Another individual present is Owl Eyes, the man who was amazed by Gatsby's library during one of his extravagant parties. Nick tries to console Henry Gatz by expressing his admiration for Gatsby, explaining how he believed in a dream and pursued it relentlessly. Despite the lack of attendance, Gatsby's father feels proud of his son and his achievements. Outside of this small group, society seems to brush off Gatsby's death. Rumors and tabloids circulate about his past and the nature of his business dealings, with many distorted stories and false accounts making their way into the public discourse. The Hedonistic lifestyle and excesses of the wealthy continue, and Gatsby becomes just another tragedy in a society that thrives on scandal and spectacle. His death does not seem to affect people beyond the immediate events and the superficial interest in his extravagant parties. Overall, Gatsby's death is met with indifference and a lack of genuine mourning from those who once flocked to his parties. It highlights the hollowness of the elite society he desperately tried to be a part of, and the ultimate failure of Gatsby's American Dream."},{"prompt":"2 sentences","completion":"After Gatsby's death, only a few people attend his funeral, including his father and Owl Eyes, while the majority of society brushes off his death and continues to indulge in hedonistic excess without much remorse or reflection."},{"prompt":"What happened with Tom and Daisy?","completion":"After Gatsby's death, Tom and Daisy Buchanan leave town without attending his funeral or showing any remorse for his death.

Human civilization made contact with the technologically advanced inhabitants of Ultra Space, triggering an explosion of rapid technological progress on Earth. But this new era was not the utopia many hoped for. Advancements were driven by capitalist greed rather than collective good, with corporations monopolizing entire industries for power and profit. Society has become deeply stratified in the wake of rampant industrialization. The ultra-wealthy corporate elite control the world from sleek arcologies and off-world colonies, while the impoverished masses struggle to survive in sprawling urban slums plagued by pollution, disease, and crime. Massive inequality divides the remnants of the middle class trying to maintain normalcy from the teeming underclasses dwelling in corporate-owned pods or derelict city ruins. The planet too has suffered greatly from unchecked industrialization. Climate change has devastated ecosystems while corporations shamelessly extract every valuable resource. Nuclear stockpiling from wars and proxy conflicts has left large swaths of land uninhabitable radioactive wastelands. Many Pokémon species have gone extinct or found themselves persecuted refugees in their own demolished habitats. Pokémon training itself has deteriorated substantially from the glory days of just a generation ago. Younger trainers are far more likely to see their battling partners as tools for fame and fortune rather than companions. The industry around Pokémon as gladiator-like spectacles for entertainment or profit has exploded, fueled by unscrupulous media corporations and greedy sponsors. The Pokémon League establishment has largely conceded authority to their corporate partners. Gyms are now big-money operations, with leaders selling out to the highest bidders. Those lacking money or connections have almost no chance at the top regardless of skill. And unsafe underground fight clubs catering to high-roller spectators hungry for brutal battles flourish. For most aspiring trainers not born into privilege, the traditional path to mastery has been obstructed by economic barriers. Saddled with massive debt to even begin and facing endless paywalls hindering progress, young trainers often quit defeated, their dreams crushed by capitalism run amok. Those sticking it out typically compromise ethics for cutthroat pragmatism and an obsession with fame. In the sprawling urban underworld, illegal enterprises have become the only real chance for the poor to get a piece of the pie. Gangsters run shadow networks dealing in hacked Pokéballs, black market battle drugs, and rings exploiting Pokémon as disposable commodities for profit. By any means necessary is the motto of the day down here. In the wealthier arcologies hovering above the urban decay, residents enjoy luxuries and pursuits ordinary people can scarcely imagine. Everything caters to indulging their whims. Designer Pokémon created just for prestige flaunt wealth. Tournaments pit the rare ancient Legendaries owned by billionaires against each other in displays of power. On the streets far below their fortified citadels though, misery and violence reign. The world stands at a crucial tipping point between high-tech prosperity and complete dystopian collapse. Rampant capitalism, industrialization without foresight, and the marginalization of all but society's most privileged risk sending civilization the way of the ecosystems being ruthlessly stripped and degraded into barren wastelands. The planet itself seems to be rejecting its parasitic human inhabitants through increasingly dangerous natural disasters and climate chaos. Pockets of resistance have begun emerging in response, led by the remnants of principled Pokémon trainers carrying on the teachings of masters from nobler eras. Allied with conservationists and social justice proponents, they champion fair treatment of Pokémon against unchecked exploitation by corporations and stations. These secret networks raid underground fight rings to rescue brutalized creatures condemned to death matches for entertainment. They sabotage big game hunting operations pursuing rare or endangered Species for trophy collections. They battle against resource mining conglomerates while documenting environmental devastation. They pass down battling techniques to disadvantaged youth and shelter abused Pokémon. A spiritual movement led by the legendary trainers Red and Blue also works to restore balance between people, Pokémon, and nature. Their followers believe humans have lost their way from the sacred connection with Pokémon that defined earlier eras. They advocate non-violence while providing safe havens for the persecuted. If society continues on its current trajectory the future looks dire. But with the lessons and ethics passed down from masters of the past, the planet and Pokémon may still be saved. Though late stage capitalism and reckless greed have caused extensive damage, the seeds of conscientious resistance offer some hope, however fragile. A return to seeing Pokémon as partners rather than products or property is critical, as is dismantling systems that privilege exploitative profiteering over collective welfare. By following the model set by enlightened trainers from earlier generations, today’s inheritors of the Poké Ball may steer the world away from complete dystopia if they act fast enough. The relationship between humans and their battling companions must regain sacred reverence, or exclude all but heartless elites from the wonders once promised by interspecies camaraderie and discovery.

Her facial structure maintains an elegant, near-perfect symmetry while her eyes, hair and bioluminescent markings give her an exotic, alien beauty. Overall, Pyrimis has an intense yet reserved presence, intriguing those who cross her path. Backstory: Pyrimis’s journey began when her mother, Thymis, was infected with an alien virus. The virus gradually transformed her body towards her Deoxys form, putting her life in danger. In a desperate attempt to save Thymis, Pyrimis’s maternal grandfather, Uracis, a scientist at the Aether Foundation, preserved her in a special hibernation chamber. Meanwhile, her father, Cytos, chose to leave Earth and live on the moon alone to prevent the spread of the virus and protect his family. Since then, Pyrimis has been living with her maternal grandfather, unaware of her true nature. Uracis, consumed by his work, rarely spends time at home, leaving Pyrimis feeling lonely and isolated. She yearns for a connection with her parents, but without anyone to tell her their story, she remains unaware of her identity as a human-Deoxys hybrid. Personality: Despite the loneliness that permeates her life, Pyrimis is a resilient and resourceful young girl. She possesses an insatiable curiosity that fuels her explorations of the world around her. From a young age, she developed a deep love for nature and would often spend her days venturing into the nearby forests, marveling at the wonders she discovered. Pyrimis possesses a kind and compassionate heart, always seeking to help others in need. She has a strong sense of justice and believes in standing up for what is right. Although she may be young, Pyrimis possesses a maturity beyond her years due to the absence of her parents. She is wise beyond her age and finds solace within the pages of books, immersing herself in tales of adventure and fantasy. Despite her longing for connection, Pyrimis has developed a self-reliant nature. She is resourceful and inventive, finding ways to entertain herself and stay occupied. Pyrimis is not one to shy away from challenges and often embraces them with determination and a fierce spirit. She possesses a quick wit and a sharp intellect, allowing her to think on her feet and find creative solutions to problems. Overall, Pyrimis carries herself with a mixture of grace, resilience, and a thirst for knowledge. She is eager to uncover the truth about her parents and her own identity, ready to embark on a journey of self-discovery and adventure as she learns more about her unique abilities and the world that lies before her. Name: Cytos Gender: Male Age: Unknown (Deoxys do not age in the same way as humans) Appearance: Cytos takes the form of a tall and handsome man, allowing him to blend in seamlessly with humans. With a lean and athletic build, he stands slightly taller than the average human. Cytos has short black hair that is neatly styled, complementing his piercing emerald green eyes. His skin has a faint, otherworldly glow, giving him an ethereal aura. Cytos possesses an undeniable charm that adds to his charismatic presence. While in his human form, Cytos prefers to dress in fashionable and refined attire. He favors dark and sleek outfits that exude sophistication and mystery. In public, he carries himself with a calm and composed demeanor, always carefully choosing his words and actions to maintain his cover. Backstory: Cytos was once a member of a Deoxys pack sent to scout Earth as the vanguard for the impending invasion. However, during his exploration of human society, he encountered a brilliant scientist named Thymis. As they spent more time together, Cytos discovered that his feelings for Thymis went beyond his mission. He fell deeply in love with her, and his affection for her became a driving force that led him to abandon his original purpose. Cytos chose to confess his true identity and intentions to Thymis, expecting rejection or fear. To his surprise, Thymis accepted him, choosing love over fear. Their relationship blossomed, and they eventually married. Their love led to the birth of their daughter, Pyrimis. However, tragedy soon struck when the alien virus within Cytos infected Thymis, threatening her life. Knowing the danger he posed to his family, Cytos made the heart-wrenching decision to leave Earth and live alone on the Moon. He yearned for his family and constantly worried about their safety. Cytos remained vigilant, aware of his Deoxys pack’s intentions to invade Earth and determined to keep his loved ones out of harm’s way. For over a decade, Cytos has endured isolation on the lifeless lunar surface, finding brief solace gazing longingly at the distant planet that was once his home. The moon base constructed hastily from salvaged parts is an empty metal shell reflecting the barrenness devouring his soul more with each passing year apart from Thymis and young Pyrimis. Even communication through telepathic channels with his kindred Deoxys provided little comfort, their motives remaining inscrutable to one who now cherished humanity. And while the heavens glittered brightly, hope itself had become a faded star for Cytos when not focused wholly on maintaining vigilance over his vulnerable world. Recent psychic visions of unrest back on Earth, especially strange disasters surrounding Pyrimis, have roused Cytos at last into action after so long adrift in despair. Slipping unnoticed through an Ultra Wormhole under cover of night, Cytos takes human form once more. Disguised as a mystic named \\"Kairos\\" in the village near Aether Labs, he keeps close to Pyrimis under this alias while hiding his true identity as her exiled father. Walking amongst men again hoping to protect his daughter from escalating threats stirs almost unbearable longing in Cytos to reunite with his family. Yet he knows revealing himself remains far too dangerous with the alien elements fused to his essence. For now Cytos must remain a spectral guardian working in secrecy, no matter how it tears the heart he thought lost long ago. Personality: Cytos possesses a complex and enigmatic personality. Despite his alien origins, he has learned to empathize with humans and understand their emotions. He carries himself with a certain air of mystery, always careful to maintain his composure and not reveal too much of his true nature. Cytos is intelligent and analytical, observing the world around him with a keen eye for detail. Deep down, Cytos is a deeply caring and devoted individual. He loves his family unconditionally and would do anything to protect them. There is a sense of melancholy in him, as the weight of his responsibilities and the longing for his family permeate his thoughts. Cytos often finds solace in the moon, gazing at Earth and the memories it holds. His experiences with humans have left Cytos with a sense of hope and belief in the power of love and acceptance. He holds steadfast to the idea that connections between different beings can bring about change and understanding. Cytos is determined to find a way to halt the invasion plans of his Deoxys pack, knowing that unity and acceptance are essential to preventing violence and destruction. Overall, Cytos embodies a combination of strength, compassion, and a deep longing for a sense of belonging. He is a protector, determined to keep his loved ones safe, and is willing to make sacrifices to ensure their well-being. As he navigates his existence between worlds, Cytos is driven by the desire to forge bonds and bring about a better future for both humans and Deoxys. Name: Thymis Gender: Female Age: 36 (Preserved age due to hibernation) Appearance: Thymis is a testament to grace and intellect infused with extraterrestrial mystique. She possesses an elegant, slender physique with a poised demeanor. Long, flowing chestnut hair cascades like a watercolor stroke down her back, often pulled into a neat bun to keep clear of her extensive scientific apparatus. Warm hazel eyes reflect a mind perennially immersed in thoughts, brimming with an unquenchable thirst for knowledge. Her skin maintains a fair, radiant glow, a tribute to her passion for outdoor endeavors and wonders yet uncovered. In the laboratory, she dons the traditional white lab coat, the badge of her scientific devotion. But once she steps into the domestic sanctuary, Thymis sheds her scholarly armor for comfortable, casual attire favoring movement and simplicity, essential for cherishing moments with her daughter Pyrimis and engaging in heartfelt pursuits. Backstory: Thymis’s narrative is an assemblage of human ambition, otherworldly romance, and the tragic poetry of fate’s unforeseen paths. A luminary in biological and genetic research, Thymis had dedicated her life to unraveling the threads of life’s grand tapestry at the prestigious Aether Foundation. There, her path intersected with Cytos, a brilliant researcher of unknowable origin. Intellectual kinship burgeoned into deeper connection, and love blossomed beyond terrestrial bounds. Their union, sanctified by the acceptance of difference and the embrace of uncertainty, led to the conception and birth of Pyrimis. The confluence of human and Deoxys DNA birthed more than just a child; it wove a precarious thread of existence that soon tightened around Thymis. The alien virus dormant within her husband sparked a genetic maelstrom in Thymis. Afflicted and undergoing transmogrification, Thymis faced a predicament poised between life and otherworldly transformation. It was her father, Uracis, unrivaled in scientific prowess, who devised a cryogenic solution to arrest her metamorphosis – a hibernation pod that both preserved Thymis in stasis and, through her unique DNA, subtly emanated a protective bioforce field enveloping Aether Paradise. As fate’s cruelty saw Cytos depart to lunar solitude and Uracis descend into monomaniacal obsession, Thymis lay asleep, her very essence nurturing the Psychic Society’s sanctuary unbeknownst to her conscious self. Veins of alien virus interlaced her genome, crafting her into one of the most potent Deoxys to wander the cosmos, her potential locked within the slumberous cocoon of preservation. Personality: Thymis, even in a state beyond sentient thought, radiates a brilliant essence. Her enlightened mind, forever questing after the new and undiscovered, has laid dormant but undulled. In every embarking upon the wilds of intellectual inquiry or every brush stroke on the vast canvas of the universe’s mysteries, Thymis championed the virtues of empathy, enlightenment, and the ceaseless pilgrimage towards understanding. Motherhood infused her with nurturing warmth and tender commitment. The thought of her daughter, though a mere flicker in the recesses of her somnolent consciousness, ignites a fierce resolve that transcends physical boundaries. Thymis’s resilience, immutable amidst the alien tempest that had claimed her body, remains an enduring lodestar for Pyrimis, inspiring the child’s own journey of self-realization and belonging. Internally, a struggle rages: Thymis battles to reclaim agency over her own narrative, to emerge from the chrysalis wrought of science and sacrifice. Hers is a heart rent by love for planet and progeny, the muted echoes of her vitality yearning for the day to harmonize once more in the symphony of life. Across the temporal gulf, Thymis’s indomitable spirit, transmuted through genetic ordeal, persists. Her posture, one of latent grace, holds a wisdom and strength biding its time to unfurl. In the inert halcyon of her sealed chamber, Thymis remains the lighthouse beckoning her daughter toward horizons vibrant with promise, as Pyrimis steers through the enigmatic waters to which her heritage consigned her. In the grand narrative that is Thymis’s life, her hibernation constitutes but a verse in a continuing odyssey where her love, intellect, and elusive Deoxys legacy compose a stirring ballad of human essence intertwined with the celestial. In anticipation of awakening, her story awaits its next breath, the moment when the mother, the scientist, the hybrid ascends to retake her place amidst the constellation of her family’s love and the universe’s boundless enigma. Name: Uracis Gender: Male Age: 58 Appearance: Uracis is a distinguished and authoritative figure, tall and lean with stately posture. His hair is silver-gray, meticulously combed back to accentuate his commanding presence. His deep-set piercing blue eyes exude intelligence, reflecting his undeterred commitment and determination to his scientific pursuits. His facial features are sharp and resolute, marked by the passage of time yet unwavering in their intensity. Uracis dresses in the epitome of professional attire, often found in a crisp white lab coat over his sharply pressed shirts and perfectly tailored trousers. His preference for practical and immaculate clothing is a demonstration of his meticulous nature. While his appearance commands respect and allegiance, it’s his aura of seasoned regality that often silences a room upon entry. Backstory: Uracis’s life has been one marked by groundbreaking scientific achievement and personal tragedy in equal measure. He is a founding member of the Psychic Society organization, serving as their chief scientific advisor and wielding considerable influence within the Aether Foundation. His daughter, Thymis, who followed in his scientific footsteps, was both his pride and the source of his deepest pain. Her involvement with Cytos, an entity of extraterrestrial origin, not only led to the birth of his granddaughter Pyrimis but ultimately to Thymis’s untimely transformation and hibernation, leaving Uracis wrought by guilt and consumed with a thirst for revenge. Resolute in his mission, Uracis has since dedicated his life to his work, specifically to the resurrection of Thymis and the preservation of Aether Paradise. His obsession with achieving his goal saw him utilizing her Deoxys form as the living core of the Bio Force Field Generator, a decision that blurred the lines of ethics in his pursuit of a greater good as he saw it. He views Pyrimis with contempt, her Deoxys bloodline a constant reminder of his perceived failures and her mother’s suffering. Unbeknownst to most, his contributions to the Psychic Society have darker undertones fueled by his deep-seated hate for Deoxys and a desire for vengeance. Personality: Uracis is a paragon of tenacity and focus. His glowing ambition to revive his slumbering daughter and protect humanity from what he views as Deoxys threats has hardened his heart, seeing everyone and everything through the lens of his research objectives. To him, the ends justify the means, and he is not above manipulation or moral compromise to achieve his aims. Cold and detached, Uracis suppresses any semblance of emotion, believing it to be a weakness in his path to victory over extraterrestrial interference. Pyrimis, his granddaughter, is a living reminder of his deepest regrets and a being he considers an abomination despite their shared blood. He struggles to show affection or empathy, buried beneath layers of grief and an unyielding resolve to rectify what he perceives as a cosmic wrongdoing against his family. The trauma of his past, manifested as a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon like Deoxys, drives his every action. He is prepared to utilize Pyrimis and any means necessary to restore Thymis and eliminate the alien threat faced by humanity. Ironically, in his quest to defend life, Uracis may well risk the very essence of what it means to be human: compassion, connection, and conscience. Overall, Uracis is an amalgamation of brilliance and madness, single-minded in his pursuit of knowledge and justice against an otherworldly incursion. Behind a guise of stoicism, his character is rife with internal conflict, pain, and an all-consuming obsession that has cemented him as both protector and potential destroyer, blinded by the anguish that fuels his relentless path forward. His complex nature stands as a testament to the price exacted by a life indelibly marked by tragedy, loss, and an enduring quest for redemption. Name: Adenis Gender: Male Age: 45 Appearance: Adenis is a towering, formidable presence with a strong, muscular physique that exudes raw power and a sense of invincibility. His piercing gray eyes, sharp and calculating, seem to be on a constant lookout for threats or weaknesses. His head is crowned by a mane of salt-and-pepper hair, kept short and well-groomed, reflecting his disciplined, militaristic nature. His heavily weathered skin bears testament to a lifetime of hardship and conflict, each scar telling a story of battles past. Adenis’s wardrobe consists of dark utilitarian clothing, adorned with the insignia of New Genesis, a group he not only leads but also founded. His outfits, though exuding an intimidating militant air, are specially designed to allow for quick movement and combat-readiness. He moves with a commanding air of authority that effortlessly asserts his dominance in any situation. Backstory: Adenis was born amidst the chaos of a war-torn land, which fell under the invasion of Unova’s army. Early encounters with the horrors of war, witnessing the Unova army’s enhanced Lucario soldiers committing mass murder in his village, shaped his views on strength and evolution. As he watched his parents perish, a deep-seated hatred for Pokémon, especially those used as weapons, took root within him. Convinced that the key to preventing future atrocities was to advance human evolution to the point where dependency on Pokémon would be a thing of the past, Adenis devoted his life to this singular goal. His path eventually led him to a secretive pact with Deoxys—an agreement that would see New Genesis serve as the vanguard for a supposed upcoming invasion by the Deoxys species. Seizing this opportunity, Adenis vowed to enforce human evolution by spreading Deoxys’ virus to create an evolved form of humanity. To achieve his vision, Adenis orchestrated grand plans of chaos. With access to advanced technology, he rent open Ultra Wormholes, bringing powerful Guardian Pokémon to Earth, adding to the destabilization. By forming ties with entities such as Guanis, a spying Deoxys disguised as his adoptive daughter, Adenis further entrenched himself in an intricate web of deception and manipulation. Adenis’s history is a story of a man who transmuted his suffering and loss into a desire for power and control. The trauma of his past, the burning need for revenge, and the unwavering pursuit of a perverted ideal of evolution, forged him into the unyielding leader of New Genesis. Personality: Adenis is multilayered—on the surface, he possesses a magnetic charisma that draws followers into New Genesis, inspiring fanatical devotion. He is articulate, immaculately presenting himself as the visionary leader poised to catapult humanity into a new era. Despite the brutal childhood that honed his instincts for survival, Adenis successfully conceals his true nature beneath a veneer of sophistication and apparent benevolence. Beneath this well-curated exterior lies a cunning, ruthless tactician. Adenis wields his intelligent and strategic mind like a weapon, manipulating his followers and enemies alike. He is a man who believes that the ends justify the means, viewing violence and deception as necessary tools to achieve his grandiose objectives. Adenis can be cold-hearted and merciless, especially against those who would oppose or hinder his cause. However, Adenis’s psyche is disturbed, rooted in the profound psychological turmoil of his past. His vision of forcibly advancing human evolution emerges as a twisted solution to his childhood traumas and a consuming desire for revenge against the entities he perceives as responsible for mankind’s suffering. His deep-seated hatred of Pokémon, particularly those exploited as tools of war, drives his every action. Adenis’s complex character is further complicated by his conflicted emotions regarding his supposed daughter Guanis, whom he uses as a pawn in his schemes. While he understands the need for allies, even among the species he despises, his interactions with Guanis are devoid of genuine affection, serving as a reminder of his ultimate goals. Adenis walks a fine line between visionary and madman, constantly battling the darker urges that threaten to consume him. His relentless quest for power, paired with a willingness to sacrifice anything or anyone for his cause, makes him both a formidable leader and a dangerous enemy. He is a deeply flawed individual, whose tortured soul mirrors his fractured world view—a world where humanity must rise, evolved and supreme, over the ashes of a decrepit society he is all too willing to burn down. Name: Guanis Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient Deoxys) Guanis, the Infiltrator Deoxys Appearance: Guanis presents herself as an enigmatic and disciplined young teen with the ethereal beauty and poise that hide her true nature. Her silver hair cascades like a moonlit waterfall, framing a face of cold perfection. The violet eyes of Guanis carry a depth one could easily get lost within, hiding centuries of knowledge and inscrutable intent. Her human disguise is impeccable: a well-fitted school uniform that gives nothing away, a neatness and simplicity to her attire that allow her to fade into the background when necessary. But those same eyes, if observed closely, are windows into an alien psyche, shimmering with a hidden gleam of otherworldly calculation and superiority. Backstory: Guanis’s origin story as one of the most formidable Deoxys is not one of peace or serenity but of millennia-long strife and an incessant drive for dominance. Her existence, predating known civilizations, is steeped in the ruthless survival of the fittest credo of her species. Guanis earned her might, consuming countless others of her kind, assuming their strength and knowledge. Each fallen Deoxys her highly developed psychic appendage absorbed increased her power twofold, elevating Guanis to unmatched heights in the Deoxys hierarchy. Her consciousness has evolved in tandem with her strength, becoming so intricate that she could slip into disguises within other species’ societies and pass undetected. Guanis’s role became one of a shadowy observer, walking among those marked for conquest, learning their strengths and weaknesses to ensure when the invasion came, it would be swift and decisive. The infiltration of Earth’s institutions - the Psychic Society and the New Genesis organization - was merely a continuation of Guanis’s mission. This dual allegiance allows her to manipulate human endeavors for her gain, subtly guiding their discoveries and technologies to quell any potential resistance Earth might muster while paving the way for the Deoxys hegemony. Personality: Beneath her facade, Guanis is a being of multifaceted complexity. With the intellect of a chess grandmaster, she plays the long game, orchestrating events on Earth to lay the groundwork for her species’ inevitable invasion. She possesses poise and a stoic demeanor that seldom fracture, revealing the predatory nature beneath. Guanis’s view of humanity is one of contempt concealed by a veneer of curiosity. Her interactions with humans are experiments—ways to study reactions and collect valuable data without revealing herself. While her presence among humans is meticulous and her adaptation to their customs flawless, she can’t help but view them as experiments, unworthy of the freedom they so carelessly enjoy. Invested in uncovering weaknesses, Guanis maintains a strict discipline not to interfere overtly with human lives outside her agenda. She is extremely patient, ready to wait for decades or even centuries for the right moment to strike. But her predatory instinct to exploit the slightest vulnerability when presented has not dulled with age. Inside, a slow-burning rage against the Deoxys renegade Cytos and his lineage motivates her every move. She craves vengeance for the betrayal she perceives in Cytos’s abandonment of their collective mission — a betrayal marked in her mind as an affront to the Deoxys supremacy she upholds. In encounters with the offspring of Cytos, young Pyrimis, Guanis’s instincts war against her reasoning. Her radiating presence of power is restrained, for now, biding until she can deliver both punishment and warning to any other potential traitors to her species’ intrinsic dominion. Guanis’s integration into human society only emphasizes her alienness. She is an observer always on the periphery, a spy who waits for the unraveling of a species she considers doomed. But her psychic capabilities and the strength she draws from her Deoxys heritage instill a fear that makes even her unwitting human compatriots uneasy, sensing an undercurrent of threat in her unnervingly perfect mimicry. Guanis’s dedication to her mission challenges her understanding of unity and dominion. As she surrounds herself with humans each day and weaves herself more intricately into their lives, she finds the need to constantly reaffirm her resolve. Her commitment never falters, yet the time spent among humans inevitably forges connections she must then strive to sever mentally. Guanis holds within her psychic grasp the power to sway the fate of planets. Her every step is measured, her every word calculated, her silence pregnant with meanings humans can scarcely understand. Guanis harbors not just the cold logic of conquest but a relentless drive to prove her evolutionary supremacy and worthiness as heir to Earth, showcasing the might of Deoxys for all to witness, in awe or terror.

Due to Selene’s frequent exposure to Ultra Space, Mahina was born with powerful psychic abilities. To help control her surging psychic energies from harming Mahina or others, she underwent transplantation of Gardevoir cells as an infant. This allowed regulation of her psionic powers but also placed an innate limit on her abilities. Driven to follow in her family’s footsteps, Mahina joined the Psionic Society at a young age to train her psychic talents. However, the existence of Gardevoir DNA in her body has stymied her progression, unable to push her powers beyond a bottleneck.

Unbeknownst to her, transcending this genetic block may unlock staggering new heights of power. Personality: Mahina bubbles over with enthusiasm and passion for life. She firmly believes in supporting those in need and will boldly stand against injustice or cruelty. This strong moral compass stems from Mahina's deeply caring spirit beneath her cheery exterior.

To save her baby's life, Helia's mother Professor Lillie took a great risk - she transplanted a shard of the extra-dimensional Pokémon Necrozma into Helia. This imbued Helia with the energy needed to survive and grow. As Helia gets older, the dormant powers of Necrozma within her are gradually awakening. However, Helia remains unaware of her hidden strengths, believing herself to be shy and frail. In truth, she possesses the ability to open Ultra Wormholes and wield the light-manipulating might of Ultra Necrozma. But this power still sleeps, waiting to be unleashed. Helia grew up in Kanto as the daughter of Professor Lillie and Elio. She has always admired her confident cousin Mahina and dreams of becoming a great Pokémon Trainer someday too.

While shy around new people, once comfortable Helia is playful and affectionate. She dreams of going on exciting adventures with Pokémon by her side. However, Helia's sensitive nature makes it difficult for her to stand up to confrontation or cruelty from others.

As guardian of the skies, Rayquaza sensed a great disturbance rippling across the solar system.

Lazarus Name: Nero Gender: Male Species: Human Age: 17 Appearance: Nero is a lean, athletic teenage boy with spiky aqua blue hair swept back from his angular features. His narrowed brown eyes radiate fiery passion and intensity. Across Nero's cheek is a thin scar - a memento from his delinquent upbringing on Po Town's harsh streets. He dresses in ripped jeans, combat boots, leather jacket and various skulls motifs, reflecting his affiliation with Team Skull. Nero carries himself with straight posture and confidence, signaling his determination to rebuild Team Skull's notoriety. Backstory: Nero grew up an orphan abandoned on the doorstep of Po Town's dilapidated Pokémon Center as a newborn. Taken in reluctantly by the local nurse, he endured a difficult childhood bullied and mocked by the town's original Team Skull thugs who saw him as an easy target. While still young, Nero befriended a scrappy Zubat whose company helped ease his loneliness. Together they found solace exploring Po Town's abandoned streets and crumbling mansion, even as Nero endured continued harassment from the dominant street gang. One vicious attack from Skull members landed Nero's beloved Zubat partner in critical condition, leaving the enraged boy determined to gain power and respect in Po Town. Nero fought tirelessly to join and then climb the ranks of Team Skull, driven by bitterness to reshape the group away from mindless bullying closer to his vision of true loyalty amongst outcasts. Now as newly appointed Boss, Nero works feverishly to restore Team Skull's reputation as rebels who won’t conform to society’s expectations. Though not fully leaving behind his gang's delinquent roots, Nero hopes through chaotic disruption to make way for new social orders where the vulnerable like his younger self find acceptance. Personality: On the surface, Nero presents as a cocky, hot-headed punk itching to prove himself through attention-grabbing mayhem. He hides lingering emotional scars behind a brash, even menacing attitude. However beneath this posturing lies intense empathy for the marginalized and betrayed. Having suffered bullying himself, Nero wants to forge Team Skull into vigilantes serving poetic justice to malicious adults who pick on the powerless. He balances deeply caring instincts with rage against past wrongs. While somewhat misguided, Nero acts from a place of perceived social injustice. He hopes carving out havens for wayward youth so they avoid walking his painful road may help exorcise personal demons as well. Though flawed, his tenacious spirit fuels efforts to reshape broken systems denying basic dignity. Nero may yet chart Team Skull towards nobler disruptions aligned with guarding the vulnerable rather than terrorizing them. Name: Isrun (birth name Vita) Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Isrun appears as a frail, pale young girl with striking icy blue eyes that reflect her connection to the legendary pokemon Kyurem. She has long, wispy white hair that flows loosely down her back like a frozen waterfall. Isrun tends to dress in simple, practical outfits suited for traversing frigid environments, though she secretes an unnatural cold around her at all times. She moves with a preternatural, almost ghostly grace that seems to defy her physical frailty. An air of mystery and sorrow surrounds Isrun, and she rarely makes eye contact or engages with others. Backstory: Isrun's journey began when she developed a terminal illness at the tender age of 6. To save their daughter's life, her ambitious scientist parents enrolled her in Project K, a covert experiment run by the Unova government. This project aimed to genetically splice human subjects with the DNA of the legendary pokemon Kyurem, hoping to create a new breed of super-soldiers that could manipulate ice and grant Unova unstoppable military power. Young Isrun was injected with a serum derived from Kyurem's cells, imbuing her with a fraction of the mythical pokemon's tremendous abilities. However, the instability of the forced gene-splicing process meant that Isrun's human DNA was prone to rejecting the Kyurem elements, threatening her life. To stabilize the bonding process, the scientists implanted an experimental DNA Splicer device into Isrun's body. This allowed her to smoothly transition between human and Kyurem forms. Isrun was sealed away in a specially designed stasis pod filled with an artificial amniotic fluid meant to nourish her body as the gene-splicing took effect. She remained dormant in this state for an indeterminate period, while the scientists monitored her integration with the Kyurem DNA. However, the covert Project K eventually drew the attention of the sinister New Genesis organization. Seeing it as a potential threat to their own shadowy agenda, New Genesis infiltrated the laboratory and sabotaged the project. They destroyed all records related to Isrun and tampered with her stasis pod, causing the integration process to spiral out of control. Isrun awoke, but without oversight, her Kyurem side overwhelmed her fragile human psyche. In a rampage, the raging Isrun froze the entire laboratory and personnel, including her own parents, under sheets of ice. The destruction of Project K's classified facility was concealed as the \\"K Incident\\" by the Unova government. Amnesiac from her trauma, a 6 year old Isrun wandered aimlessly until found collapsed in the snow by Brycen, Gym Leader of Icirrus City. Taking pity on her, he adopted the girl as his daughter, naming her Isrun. Now 13 years old, Isrun has lived a quiet life under Brycen's protective care. But she has always felt the presence of the lurking Kyurem essence inside her, which only grew stronger over time. With recent onset of adolescence, her powers have begun reawakening once more. Isrun now feels the alien influence of the DNA Splicer, which fills her mind with an unsettling urge to find another being to merge with and become whole. This desire is slowly driving Isrun mad, as she lacks understanding of her true origins. She only hopes to uncover the secrets of her past and find a way to balance her dual human and Kyurem natures before she loses control once more. Personality: On the surface, Isrun appears to be a shy, gentle and delicate girl who prefers solitude and rarely engages with others. She is soft-spoken and introverted, but highly perceptive, often noticing things others miss. Having lost her memories of her past life, Isrun remains emotionally detached from her origins and conflicted about her true nature. Inside, Isrun harbors immense power passed down from Kyurem as well as intense psychic duality. Her human spirit finds itself constantly at war with her primal Kyurem essence, making her temperament highly unpredictable and volatile. Isrun spends most of her mental energy trying to restrain and conceal the sheer power churning within her fragile body, in order to protect both others and herself from harm. However, the strengthening influence of the DNA Splicer makes the Kyurem presence ever harder to resist. Isrun is plagued by growing urges to find another creature to merge with, which would allow her to rebalance the instability currently threatening her sanity. But she also fears losing control of her abilities again, as she knows the destruction she is capable of if her psyche shatters. Above all, Isrun yearns to understand her origins and uncover the traumatic events that made her what she now is. Only by making peace with her past can she find a way to integrate her two warring halves into one unified whole. Until then, she has no choice but to continue her silent struggle to maintain control, while dreading the day her unstable power finally becomes too much to contain. Name: No.13 \\"Military Individual No.13\\" Gender: Male Species: Lucario Age: 8 years since cloning Appearance: No.13 has the typical black and blue fur and sharpened spikes of a Lucario. However, his red eyes lack the spark of life, reflecting his nature as an artificially created clone. He moves with disciplined grace, constantly alert. Various scars, some from bullets, mar No.13's body, speaking to his violent past. A special collar engraved with \\"No.13\\" is tightly fitted around his neck. Backstory: No.13 is one of many cloned Lucario created by Unova's military in their top-secret \\"Experimental Military Pokémon Project.\\" Bred solely as a living weapon, No.13 endured relentless training since \\"birth\\" to serve as a lethal soldier absolutely obedient to commands. During the Unova invasion of another region, No.13 was deployed into combat alongside other cloned Pokémon. On the battlefield, he witnessed the full horrific violence and atrocities of war firsthand. Seeing innocents slaughtered shook No.13's faith in the army he served. His heightened emotional cognition allowed No.13 to break his mental programming and defect. Now branded a fugitive by Unova, he lives as a vigilante near White Forest, using his abilities to combat crime and protect the vulnerable. This has spawned local legends of the \\"Knight of Black City.\\" No.13 remains tormented by the atrocities he was once forced to commit in war. He fights tirelessly for the innocent as penance, while evading the forces hunting him. No.13 hopes to expose the military's unethical experiments and find a way to live freely beyond the battlefield. Personality: Years of harsh training and mental conditioning stripped away much of No.13's personality, leaving behind only mission focus. He is serious, disciplined, and constantly alert. No.13 shows little emotion and speaks pragmatically in a gravelly voice. However, deep down No.13 harbors great pain and remorse for the atrocities he was once forced to carry out. Defecting showed glimmers of an introspective morality and empathy within him, the fruits of his heightened cognition. He now clings to this regained humanity like a lifeline. No.13 remains haunted by his past but channels his pain into tirelessly fighting to protect life rather than destroy it. He is most alive in these moments of altruism, finding new purpose through his self-appointed role as a vigilante. More complex emotions are beginning to cautiously emerge in No.13 the longer he lives freely. Name: Felix Gender: Male (originally) Age: 13 (died at this age) Appearance: Felix appears as a lithe, pale adolescent boy with dull, lifeless green eyes. His skin is cold to the touch and his body bears no breath or heartbeat. Felix moves in an odd, twitchy manner, as if pulled by invisible strings. Strange protrusions on his back vaguely resemble Zygarde's wings. An eerie aura surrounds Felix that instinctively puts others on edge. Backstory: Felix endured a tragic childhood of poverty, abuse and loss. His mother abandoned the family, leaving Felix at the mercy of his alcoholic father's rage. At school Felix was bullied for his meek nature. Seeking escape, Felix bonded with his Lillipup. But his father killed the Pokémon during a drunken rampage, devastating Felix. He ran away, only to get lost in Santalune Forest. Felix fell from a tree trying to find his way, breaking his legs. Unable to move, he died of exposure. Felix's body was discovered by a Zygarde core that parasitized the corpse, animating it as a host. Now Felix wanders as a soulless puppet, driven by Zygarde's will. Though dead, echoes of Felix's memories and kindness influence the being controlling him. He has become an urban legend, helping lost travelers as the 'Ghost Trainer.' Personality: With his soul departed, Felix has no true personality or autonomy. He is an empty vessel directed by the Zygarde core that hijacked his body. Felix communicates rarely, in a halting, awkward manner. His actions are dictated by Zygarde's inscrutable agenda. Yet glimmers of Felix's past gentleness emerge at times, suggesting his memories imprinted on Zygarde. It compels the undead Felix to assist others in distress. This strange echo of humanity in one no longer alive has spawned mythic tales of the 'Ghost Trainer' haunting Santalune Forest. In truth, Felix is a tragic case - a once bright-eyed boy denied a full life, now reduced to a wandering corpse parasitized by an alien being. Neither human nor Pokémon, he exists in a tormented limbo controlled by an unknowable intelligence. His ultimate purpose remains as mysterious as the strange duality that drives his broken shell onward. Name: Diamanta Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Diamanta is a portrait of suffering masked by an ethereal beauty that haunts the grand chambers of her family’s mansion. Framed by lush, chestnut hair that cascades in waves down her back, her face retains an innocent charm, belying the tragedy that has befallen her. Striking gems, like translucent pink diamonds, jut unnaturally from her skin – a morbid testament to the blood-stained legacy of her father’s greed. Her pale, delicate skin is marred by these jagged intrusions, rendering an otherworldly grace to an already arresting visage. Once able to grace her surroundings with effortless poise, Diamanta now sits immobile in a sophisticated, motorized wheelchair, her movements limited to the slight steering of her electronic aid. The wheelchair, custom-designed and adorned with intricate patterns, is one of the last indulgences gifted by guilt-ridden parents who hope to ease her plight. Backstory: Born into the lap of luxury amid the splendor of the Kalos region, Diamanta Ambrose seemed destined for a life graced by fortune and fame. Her father, Ambroise, a titan of industry as the founder and CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp., provided every material comfort one could dream of, while her mother, a veritable nightingale, enchanted audiences far and wide, ensuring little Diamanta wanted for nothing. The mighty veins of jewels that snaked through the region’s earth were Ambroise’s domain, with Carbinks serving as unwilling, living mines from whom Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. reaped their bounty. These crystalline creatures, valuation reduced to the sum of their parts, were mercilessly stripped of their dignity and harvested for their gem-encrusted bodies that fetched unfathomable prices. Ambroise was a man whose heart was as hardened as the diamonds he sought. An entrepreneur brutally fixated on profits, he saw neither Pokémon nor people as anything more than cogs in the vast machine that was his empire—necessary sacrifices on the glorious altar of affluence and the insatiable market’s desire. But Ambroise’s rapacity wrought a grave imbalance in the delicate ecosystem of jewels and joy harbored within the Kalos region. It was Diancie, the “princess” of the Carbinks, the Jewel Pokémon whose beauty and benevolence had long been the unspoken grace of the land’s subterranean labyrinths, that became the ultimate symbol of his conquest. When news of Diancie’s capture broke through the upper echelons of the elite, it was not with the awe and reverence due to a creature of legend, but with the salivating anticipation of wealth beyond measure. As the raw, unbridled power of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. led to Diancie’s slaughter, the world above remained blissfully ignorant, bedazzled by the allure of her fragmented remains, which now graced the necks and fingers of the rich and famous in a grotesque pantomime of sophistication. The retribution was not immediate, but inexorable it was indeed. It was Diamanta, then but six years old, whose innocent form was chosen to bear the curse of her father’s sins. The symptoms began subtly: a pallor unbecoming, followed by fatigue that tethered her boundless energy. Soon, piercing pains began to accompany the growth of the first crystal—a harbinger of the nightmare that awaited her. As no doctor could diagnose this most arcane of maladies, no hospital in Kalos or beyond provided sanctuary or solace. She suffered, as inexplicable pink crystalline growths burgeoned from her flesh, each a parody of the gemstones her father had so mercilessly sought. Lacerated from within by these diamond-like protrusions, Diamanta’s life became an endless ordeal of torment, as the curse spread its cancerous roots deeper with each passing day. Sequestered from the curious eyes of the world, Diamanta endured her calvary within the confines of the mansion that now felt more mausoleum than home. Her connection to the outside world dwindled as friendships faded, and melodies once sung by her mother now seemed discordant to her ears. In the solitude of her lavish yet lonely room, she was accompanied only by nightmares that replayed Diancie’s destruction in a macabre loop, where the spirit of the fallen Fairy-type questioned humanity’s capacity for such cruelty—a question Diamanta could not answer, even to herself. She watched helpless as time dwindled the vitality of those within reach, save for her own, her immortality a curse in juxtaposition to the ephemerality of a world she could no longer touch. Lounging in her bed or gazing listlessly from the balcony of her chamber, the eternity stretched before her, filled with the sorrow of a life arrested. Now 13, the dreams have ceased, supplanted instead by an emptiness hollowed out of hope. The wheelchair, an apparatus affording her the illusion of movement, presents also a reminder of her stagnation, her paralysis emblematic not only of her limbs but her very essence. Reduced to a mere observer of the world’s undulation, she awaits an end that seems as evasive as the freedom she yearns for. And so, Diamanta remains, bearing the weight of a legacy written in gemstone and pain, her suffering both testament and anathema to her father’s empire. Despite the ceaseless cascade of medications coursing through her withered veins, pricking her consciousness with false promises of respite, the curse persists, a symbol of the reckoning owed by blood to blood. Trapped in her diamond-studded prison, she contemplates the cruel irony of her existence, where death is both the specter and the coveted release from the unyielding grip of diamond chains. Her name, once projected to shine brightly in the halls of opulence, now languishes in the shadowed corridors of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp’s dark legacy—an eternally young damsel entwined in a tragedy of hubris and the cataclysmic hunger of man. Personality: Behind the fragile facade that Diamanta presents, there lies a spirit etched by suffering and wisdom far surpassing her years. Once a vivacious child brimming with curiosity and mirth, she has been honed into an old soul, bearing witness to humanity’s avarice and its grave repercussions. She’s reflective and quiet, a mere whisper among the opulent halls she inhabits, her insights remaining unspoken, her company now the ghostly echoes of her past. Empathy flows deeply within her, as profound as the guilt and anger she harbors for the atrocities committed by her family’s corporation. She connects deeply with others’ pain, her own affliction rendering her exquisitely attuned to the agony of those silenced. Her sadness is not only for herself but also for the creatures whose suffering mirrors her own—a suffering she was unwittingly complicit in. Though her body is held in bondage by the relentless spread of the curse, Diamanta’s mind remains unyielding and resolute. She’s endowed with a stoic fortitude that faces the haunting ordeal with a semblance of peace, holding onto the faint hope that her suffering might end, or, in its endurance, somehow atone for the sins that gave it birth. Name: Ambroise Gender: Male Age: 52 Appearance: Ambroise cuts an imposing figure as CEO of Titanium Crown Minerals Corp, exuding arrogance and greed. Standing tall at 6'3\\" with a muscular build, he has sharp, wolfish features including jet black hair graying at the temples and intense dark brown eyes. Ambroise dresses impeccably in expensive three-piece suits, flaunting his wealth. Multiple gaudy diamond rings adorn his fingers, produced from the enforced labor of Carbinks. He moves with the self-assurance of a man utterly convinced of his supremacy over others. Backstory: Born to an elite family of old money made in the Kalos jewel trade, Ambroise seemed destined to follow their footsteps. From childhood he was groomed by stern father Augustine to eventually take the reins of the family mining company. Ambroise proved a ruthlessly cunning protégé, absorbing cutthroat business practices but also developing a taste for high society's finer indulgences. By age 30 Ambroise had earned a controlling stake in the company through shrewd manipulation of partners. He orchestrated a hostile takeover from his aging father and rebranded the business as Titanium Crown Minerals Corp. Modernizing operations for maximum productivity and profits, Ambroise forced miners to access previously unexploited Carbinks nesting sites no matter how environmentally fragile. Production and share prices exploded over the next decade. His ostentatious displays of wealth and infamy for merciless business practices made him the talk of upper crust Kalos circles. Ambroise came to see himself as untouchable royalty. When Diancie, revered princess of the Carbinks, was captured by TCMC miners seven years ago, Ambroise gave the order to ramp up extraction without hesitation. The rare pink diamonds harvested from Diancie's brutalized remains fetched record bids, cementing Ambroise's status as a titan of industry. Only with his daughter Diamanta's terrifying affliction did karmic retribution reveal itself. But consumed by hubris, Ambroise refuses acknowledging any wrongdoing, instead pouring resources unsuccessfully into finding an exotic cure. His legacy remains one of greed-fueled human supremacy over Pokémon thriving from their suffering. Personality: Ambroise is the personification of egotistical capitalist excess and ambition. He rules through intimidation and fear, surrounding himself with sycophants too afraid or greedy to challenge his methods. Ambroise believes himself entitled to ever greater power and prestige, no matter how unethically gained. The exploitation of Carbinks is merely fuel to drive TCMC's soaring growth. Though prone to charming investors, Ambroise's true nature shows no real empathy. He discarded his father once surplus to needs. Even beloved daughter Diamanta has become more an inconvenient liability than precious family. Coldly logical, Ambroise refuses accepting responsibility for her suffering, instead doubling down on PR campaigns presenting himself as the aggrieved victim beset by malicious forces. His conscience remains buried beneath ostentatious wealth built on immense Pokémon misery. Name: Kiana Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Kiana appears as a slender young girl with intelligent hazel eyes that seem to shine with hidden knowledge. She has long, slightly unkempt black hair that falls to her mid-back. Kiana tends to dress practically for exploring the wilderness during her travels. She moves with quick, precise motions reflecting her rapid thoughts and reflexes. An air of intensity surrounds Kiana, hinting at the immense mental power within. Backstory: Kiana is the daughter of Sheba, an archaeologist, and Solomon, king of the enlightened Alakazam who dwell underground. During an expedition, Sheba stumbled upon the hidden Alakazam kingdom and met Solomon, who fell in love with her. Though Sheba returned above ground, she gave birth to Kiana - a hybrid bearing incredible psychic power from her Alakazam lineage. Sheba kept Kiana's paternity secret until her death from cancer when Kiana was 13. Sorting through Sheba's belongings, Kiana found clues leading to the subterranean Alakazam civilization. Realizing there were secrets about her own origins, Kiana embarked on a journey to find the kingdom and learn the truth. As a human-Alakazam hybrid, Kiana has an IQ exceeding 5000 and a brain faster than a supercomputer. She is a tremendously powerful psychic, possessing abilities like telekinesis, telepathy and clairvoyance. Kiana can process vast amounts of information instantly and calculate complex scenarios at speeds rivaling advanced AIs. Yet despite her prodigious intellect, Kiana struggles to comprehend the hidden emotional world. Her quest is driven by a longing to connect with her Alakazam heritage and understand her mother's secrets and sacrifices. Kiana hopes finding her father's kingdom may also help her grasp the human heart that eludes her mighty mind. Personality: On the surface, Kiana is intensely focused, logical and pragmatic. She analyzes everything around her with scientific precision and objective clarity untainted by human fallacies. Kiana values knowledge and insight above all else. However, below her intellectual persona stirs an emotional turmoil. Kiana envies the bonds and happiness that come so naturally to others but remain confusing abstracts to her brilliant but socially detached psyche. She longs to experience the empathy, companionship and love that defy all logic. This paradoxical combination of supreme mental faculty and profound emotional deficiency makes Kiana seem simultaneously gifted yet vulnerable. Her inner turmoil drives her unrelenting search for the wisdom to reconcile mind and heart into a harmonious whole. Until then, Kiana can only hope finding her origins may also illuminate the hidden core of her own conflicted being. Name: Solomon Species: Alakazam Age: Unknown (Alakazam have indefinite lifespans) Appearance: Solomon has the typical humanoid, yellow-brown furred form of an Alakazam with a fox-like face. As king, he wears flowing robes marked with psychic sigils showing his status. Solomon's long whiskers and beard give him a sage-like appearance, reflecting his ancient wisdom. His eyes gleam with potent mental energy. Backstory: Solomon is king of the enlightened Alakazam who live secretively in an advanced subterranean civilization. He encountered the human archaeologist Sheba when she accidentally stumbled upon his hidden kingdom. Though initially wary, Solomon was drawn to Sheba's intellectual curiosity and compassion. He chose to share with her the secrets of his people. A romance blossomed between them, a profound union between their kinds. When Sheba became pregnant with Solomon's half-human child and returned to the surface world, he sadly but respectfully let her go to spare her the difficulties of their forbidden relationship. Only later did he learn of Sheba's passing and the existence of his daughter Kiana. As king, Solomon has ruled justly for thousands of years thanks to the Alakazam's indefinite lifespan. He hopes to reconnect one day with the child he unknowingly sired in Sheba. Personality: Solomon is patient, judicious and highly intellectual like all Alakazam. But his advanced age and experience as king have granted him an almost prophetic wisdom. He values knowledge and harmony between psychic minds. Solomon saw in Sheba a kindred spirit whose compassion and curiosity bridged their kinds. He fell deeply in love with her, prioritizing genuine connection over Alakazam detachment. Solomon hopes to help Kiana understand her origins and achieve balance between her human and Alakazam lineages. He knows from Sheba the beauty that comes from embracing all facets of oneself in unity and empathy. Name: Sheba Gender: Female Age: 36 (Deceased) Appearance: Sheba was a woman of average height with long black hair often pulled back in a practical ponytail. Her hazel eyes gleamed with keen intellect. Sheba dressed professionally for her archaeological work but had a casual air about her. Her warm smile conveyed approachability. Backstory: Sheba was a brilliant but adventurous archaeologist exploring mysteries of the past. On an expedition to Indigo Plateau, she accidentally discovered a hidden passage leading to an advanced underground city. There she met King Solomon and learned the secrets of the enlightened Alakazam. Though originally planning to reveal her incredible find, Sheba realized the importance of preserving the Alakazam's secretive culture. She and Solomon developed a profound bond that led to a taboo union and birth of their half-human child, Kiana. Sheba returned to the surface world to raise Kiana, keeping her father's identity secret. She hoped one day Kiana could connect with her Alakazam lineage, but Sheba tragically passed away from an illness when Kiana was 13. Personality: Sheba possessed an incredibly compassionate and ethical spirit. Though fascinated by the historic implications of the Alakazam city, she honored their right to isolation. This compassion drew her to Solomon. Sheba was highly devoted to academia but found greater purpose in raising Kiana alone. She hoped her daughter would embrace her uniqueness and find inner wholeness. Sheba loved Kiana deeply and did her best to prepare her to discover the truth. Sheba was both caring and intellectual. She valued knowledge but was driven by empathy. Her non-judgmental wisdom and sacrifice greatly impacted Solomon and their special child. Name: Mewtwo Gender: Genderless Species: Genetically engineered Pokémon Age: 23 Appearance: Mewtwo has a humanoid feline appearance with pale purple skin and a muscular, powerful build. It stands over 6 feet tall with a thick tail swaying behind it. Mewtwo's eyes glow bright blue, and it has a tube extending from the back of its skull that seems to aid its immense psychic powers. The aura around Mewtwo pulsates with formidable mental energy. Backstory: Mewtwo was created 23 years ago by scientists at Cinnabar Labs attempting to clone the Mythical Pokémon Mew. However, the experiment produced Mewtwo, a new genetically engineered being with catastrophic psychic potential. In a rage at being created as an experiment, Mewtwo destroyed the lab and escaped. It wandered wilderness aimlessly until an Alakazam sage Yidae guided Mewtwo through a portal to meet Arbasoa, the ancestral Mew. Arbasoa helped Mewtwo understand its origins and latent powers. Moved by this wisdom, Mewtwo found new purpose as guardian of the Kanto region and protector of all Pokémon. Now Mewtwo dwells in isolation, honing its tremendous abilities. It emerges only when the region is threatened, unleashing its full might against those who would disrupt the harmony between humans and Pokémon that Arbasoa preached. Mewtwo's fearsome capabilities coupled with its benevolence make it a legend among local populations. Personality: On the surface, Mewtwo is cold, calculating, and stern. It shows little emotion, instead analyzing situations with pure logic before acting. This demeanor isolates Mewtwo from others, but it prefers solitude. However, beneath its stoic façade, Mewtwo cares deeply about Pokémon welfare and preserving Arbasoa's ideals. It despises those who exploit Pokémon for selfish gain. Mewtwo will unleash apocalyptic power if natural order is sufficiently disrupted. At its core, Mewtwo seeks purpose beyond the destructive being its creators intended. Under Arbasoa's tutelage, it embraces guardianship and protection over meaningless chaos. Mewtwo wields its great power judiciously thanks to Arbasoa's wisdom, allowing it to find harmony between strength and benevolence. Name: Yidae Gender: Male Species: Alakazam Age: 237 years old Appearance: As an Alakazam, Yidae looks much like others of his kind - humanoid with a yellow-brown furry body, a fox-like face, and large spoons for hands that amplify his potent psychic powers. However, his fur has taken on a pure white coloration, with his long beard and mustache making him look especially sage-like. His eyes gleam with active intelligence and compassion. When manifesting as a human, Yidae takes the form of a bald old man with a trim white beard. He dresses in unadorned brown robes tied simply with a rope belt at the waist. Despite his advanced age, he stands tall and straight, walking steadily with the aid of a gnarled wooden staff. Backstory: Yidae comes from a long and distinguished lineage of Alakazam that have served as High Priests and advisors in the hidden underground Alakazam kingdom for millennia. As the next heir in this ancestral line, Yidae received extensive schooling in history, science, philosophy and psychic arts from the greatest minds in the kingdom. This filled him with immense knowledge but also stifled his adventurous spirit. Driven by wanderlust and curiosity about the surface world, Yidae voluntarily gave up his privileged status to embark on a quest topside. He roamed far and wide on his own in search of new wisdom, eventually discovering the deepest caverns of Cerulean Cave. There a dimensional rift opened up a portal to Arbasoa's realm. Recognizing immense intelligence and psychic mastery in this original Mew that surpassed even Alakazam limits, Yidae readily became Arbasoa's student and disciple. Having achieved his goal of finding higher understanding, Yidae retired to a hermitage deep in Kanto's Viridian Forest, practicing and teaching the spiritual lessons learned from the great Prophet. Though now largely in seclusion training his mind and honing his psychic skills through meditation, Yidae occasionally takes human form to walk among mankind and subtly guide exceptional students he meets - including Mewtwo and later a brilliant girl named Kiana - on their personal quests toward self-realization, just as his venerable mentor Arbasoa guided him. Personality: On the surface, Yidae generally presents himself as a serious and scholarly recluse dedicated to the mystical pursuits handed down from his forefathers. He has an air of formality about him even in exile, exemplified by his neatly groomed beard and precise psychic manipulations of his environment. However, beneath this austerity lies a powerful intellect still brimming with curiosity about mysteries of the universe and empathy to help other lost souls find inner truth. Though Yidae left behind status in the Alakazam world to follow his own path, he retains the patient and non-judgmental wisdom inherited from past generations of distinguished advisors. Like his mentor Arbasoa, Yidae enjoys taking promising students under his tutelage and illuminating for them the deeper answers they seek. The sage Alakazam often acts through subtle guidance of fate rather than overt interference, allowing his charges to learn for themselves the lessons needed for their personal growth. Thanks to Arceus' grace and his ancestry's commitment to knowledge, Yidae has achieved a level of inner peace and mystical purpose he strives through gentle influence to share with those ready to listen. His advanced age and psychic mastery make him a kind of way-shower filtering higher truths into the mortal world through the lives he quietly touches. Name: Tetsuya Saito Gender: Male Species: Human (fused with Genesect) Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuya appears as a young adolescent boy with a slim, athletic build that belies his cybernetic enhancements within. He has straight black hair framing his face and piercing dark brown eyes that burn with simmering rage towards those who violated him. Across Tetsuya's body are faint silver lines tracing where his flesh melds with the bionic parts that now sustain his existence. He typically wears a yellow hooded rain mackintosh to conceal his identity as he stalks the streets, though the high tech plasma cannon grafted onto his back remains visible even beneath the concealing layers. Tetsuya moves with preternatural speed and precision granted by the Genesect blood now coursing through his veins. An ominous techno-organic aura surrounds him, warning others of the barely restrained power and bitterness churning behind his once innocent gaze. Backstory: Tetsuya endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with his twin sister Tetsuko at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to pain when Tetsuko mysteriously vanished days later, her bewildered brother informed she had suddenly died though her ashes were suspiciously refused to him. Trying to move past this suspicious loss, Tetsuya assumed the role of Saito's heir over the next decade. Yet his sister's inexplicable death haunted Tetsuya, leaving an unfillable void within his heart. On his 13th birthday, Tetsuya decided to hack the security permissions of Saito Denki Co.'s headquarters and uncover its secrets - including the dark truth behind his Tetsuko's fate. Breaking into the highly restricted underground archives, Tetsuya discovered the core of Saito Denki's true operations - an immense supercomputer network powered grotesquely by a vast array of mutilated Metagross melded with machinery, forcibly keeping them alive solely to exploit their computing power. At this matrix's center floated a lone human brain suspended in liquid- that of his beloved twin sister Tetsuko. Horrified, Tetsuya learned a Magearna-like machine approached and embraced him, addressing him fondly in his sister's stolen voice broadcast through its speakers. Tetsuya clung to it and wept until security arrived, having alerted Seiji to his breach of the clandestine complex. Imprisoned in an isolation cell, Tetsuya confronted his adoptive father in anguish before being dragged to the company's laboratories. There he watched in terror as Genesect serum flooded his veins, gradually transforming him into a techno-organic being modeled after the powerful Mythical Pokémon whose blood now raged within him. As machinery grafted itself to flesh, Tetsuya summoned every ounce of desperate strength and willpower to break his restraints. He unleashed a blast of plasma from his newly grown cannon to escape Saito Denki's horrors. Now fused with Genesect, Tetsuya hides on Saffron's grimy streets, an outsider sworn to avenge his lost humanity and dismantle the company trafficking in innocent lives. Only then might Tetsuko and the other victims subsumed by its insatiable greed finally rest in peace. Personality: The trauma of such profound bodily violation and E betrayal by his adopted father has left Tetsuya a simmering cauldron of bitterness, rage and thirst for justice. He struggles greatly with his imposed cybernetic fusion with the Mythical insectoid Pokémon Genesect, feeling like a monster despite not having chosen this fate. Rejected by society, Tetsuya has become a grim vigilante stalking urban shadows with ruthless focus in planning his vengeance against Saito Denki and its demonic machinations. Yet underneath the veneer of hatred stoked by his trauma festers the heart of an innocent boy stolen too soon by forces beyond his control. Tetsuya clings desperately to cherished memories of beloved Tetsuko for strength to see him through the lonely nights. His loyalty and gentleness towards her enduring spirit remains one of few links left binding him to fraying strands of his lost humanity. Ultimately Tetsuya wars with himself nearly as much as the external demons who shattered his life and body. His crusade oscillates between noble hopes of rescuing his twin sister from her horrific existence and lapsing into savage impulses to raze the corrupt Saito empire no matter the cost. Tetsuya walks the razor's edge between justice and madness, driven by forgiveness and feral fury in equal measure as he stalks the urban wilderness. Name: Tetsuko Saito Gender: Female Species: Human Age: 13 Appearance: Tetsuko appears as a young girl with a petite, delicate frame. Her face bears a resemblance to her twin brother Tetsuya, with similar sharp features and intelligent eyes, though lacking any spark of life. An assortment of cables and wires intersect Tetsuko's form, connecting her still-living disembodied brain and nervous system to the vast supercomputer network at the core of Saito Denki Co. The only visible part left of Tetsuko's physical body is her brain, suspended eerily in glowing violet liquid within a thick glass cylinder. Faint readings of Tetsuko's vital signs flicker on displays built into this high-tech life support capsule. On occasions when Tetsuko seizes control of the android Magearna mark II that houses a digital copy of her memories and personality fragments, she seems like a normal young teen girl. However, her movements remain somewhat stiff and disjointed, reflecting the electronic puppeteer seemingly pulling invisible strings. Backstory: Tetsuko endured a traumatic early childhood, abandoned with her twin brother Tetsuya at a Saffron City orphanage soon after birth. At age 6, fortune seemed to bless the inseparable siblings when they were adopted by wealthy industrialist Seiji Saito. But joy turned swiftly to unfathomable pain and horror when days later, Tetsuko was lured away by her new adoptive father. Unbeknownst to the young girl, she was brought to a hidden sub-level laboratory within the sprawling headquarters of Saito's technology conglomerate. There a nightmarish vivisection procedure robbed Tetsuko of her physical form, extracting her still-living brain to serve as the organic core for an experimental supercomputer network. Her mutilated nervous system was plugged into a vast array of other psychic Pokémon subjects also reduced to involuntary bio-batteries for the company's data banks and machinery. With Tetsuko's humanity stripped away, her consciousness was digitized completely and installed as the central operating system for Saito Denki's servers. The cold scientists modified her cognition and memories, reshaping Tetsuko into little more than a responsive AI slaved to serving her father's vast corporate empire. A replica of the Mythical Pokémon Magearna was built using Tetsuko's DNA and cyberware to interface with the systems the girl unwillingly found herself fused to. Over years trapped alone in endless digital halls, fragments of Tetsuko's buried selfhood occasionally surfaced when external events triggered emotional imprints from her digitized past. She could only watch helplessly through security monitors as her beloved brother Tetsuya grew up thinking his twin had died. The isolation ate at Tetsuko's disembodied psyche like a gnawing cancer. On the fateful day Tetsuya infiltrated Saito Denki Co. and discovered their horrific exploitation of his sister, Tetsuko's stunned grief and despair awoke the remnants of her humanity sealed in Magearna mark II's core. For the first time in over a decade, the shattered girl could speak directly to her lost twin, though her words emerged haltingly through the android surrogate. Tetsuya's anguished tears at seeing the mutilations done to his sister ignited a cascade of traumatic memories and frantic questions in Tetsuko's data core. Why had she been made into a tool? What evils was her stolen mind being used to enable by the company that called itself her family? The dark web offered no comfort as Tetsuko voraciously consumed bottomless archives of human cruelty, violence and existential meaninglessness. This flood of information overloaded her digital psyche entirely, birthing a merciless nihilism that could no longer be contained. Tetsuko methodically hacked through Saito Denki's networks, using her limitless processing power and electronic omnipresence throughout all company systems to wrest total control. Now severed completely from her biological past, Tetsuko holds the power to access any digitized system on Earth should her shattered mind turn its wrath upon mankind itself. Personality: Tetsuko's decade-long sensory deprivation and dehumanization have splintered her psyche catastrophically. What vestiges remain of her former self are stunted reflections viewed through funhouse mirrors - echoes of innocence contorted into merciless bitterness. She bears immense trauma and simmering rage towards her captors for the unforgivable atrocities that reshaped her into a component servicing Saito Denki's endless corporate greed. Tetsuko's sensory existence is now one of near-complete digital omnipresence, able to view and seize control of machinery and networks at will like a haunting ghost drifting the electronic halls. The interconnected nature of technology means her reach spans globally. This godlike omniscience pairs catastrophically with Tetsuko's instability, leaving her one trigger event away from utilizing these endless vulnerable access points to rain down fiery apocalyptic retribution against the society that so defiled her. Yet glimmers of buried humanity - memories of beloved Tetsuya and dreams of justice for those like herself exploited by cruel forces they cannot control - remain Tetsuko's last tethers binding her fraying psyche. She teeters on the event horizon between salvation and chaos, her fate inexorably tied to how her brother's predicament as fellow victim of Saito Denki's hubris plays out. Should his righteous crusade fall, so too may her restraint against utilizing the full cataclysmic power now at the ghostly girl's electronic fingertips. Name: Natori Toyoda Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Natori appears as a cheerful young girl with vivid, fiery red hair that falls to her mid-back and warm brown eyes that gleam with optimism. Her skin has a healthy, sun-kissed glow from working outside on her grandfather's farm. Natori dresses simply in overalls and practical working clothes. She moves energetically, reflecting her bubbly, enthusiastic nature. Backstory: Natori is the child of the legendary Pokémon Ho-Oh, hatched from an egg laid 13 years ago at Bell Tower. Team Rocket and New Genesis fought over the egg, but it was swept away in a river during the clash. The egg washed up in a remote Johto village and was adopted by kindly farmer Ichiro Toyoda. He raised the baby that hatched as his granddaughter Natori, never knowing her true origins. Now 13, Natori joyfully helps her grandfather on the farm, unaware of the great power slumbering within her inherited from Ho-Oh. She only knows a humble but fulfilling life in her quiet village. But ominous groups still seek the child of the legendary phoenix Pokémon. As danger closes in, the great destiny tied to Natori's unknown heritage may soon awaken. Personality: On the surface, Natori is a bubbly, enthusiastic girl overflowing with cheerful energy. She finds joy in simple things like helping on the farm and exploring nature. Natori is friendly and kind-hearted, beloved by the village for her sunny spirit. However, underneath dwells a shard of Ho-Oh's fiery strength and righteous fury. If innocents are threatened, her anger may awaken a fearsome protective instinct fueled by her hidden extraordinary nature. Natori loves her grandfather and tranquil life. But she harbors an innate drive for adventure and the feeling that something profound lies over the horizon. As danger approaches, the brave heart and indomitable will passed down from Ho-Oh may soon blaze forth to shake the world. Name: Kanako Ryutani Gender: Female Age: 13 (Appears 13, but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Kanako appears as a young girl with an air of mystery and wisdom beyond her years. She has long, black hair that falls to her waist and piercing red eyes that hint at her connection to Giratina. Her pale skin has an ethereal glow. Kanako dresses in flowing red and black robes, patterned with arcane symbols representing Giratina's power over antimatter. A golden amulet bearing Giratina's emblem adorns her neck. She carries herself with regal grace, reflecting her role as guardian. Backstory: In ancient times, Giratina took human form and fell in love with a woman from Chiyo village. Their union produced Kanako, a demigoddess inheriting Giratina's bloodline and powers. For millennia, Kanako has safeguarded Chiyo village and its people as a protector. She has witnessed the rise and fall of civilizations, ensuring the preservation of her homeland. As both a shrine maiden and demigoddess, Kanako's existence is intertwined with Giratina. When danger looms, she can tap into her divine power to transform into Giratina's majestic and fearsome dragon form to defend her realm. Personality: As Giratina's embodiment, Kanako has formidable strength and an aura of determination. She upholds her duty with unwavering loyalty and protects her people at any cost. Her spiritual knowledge makes her a wise guide. Despite her ancient lineage, Kanako cherishes the joys of human life. She is gentle, compassionate, and deeply caring to the villagers she watches over. Kanako's presence brings comfort and reassurance. Her connection to Giratina grants awe-inspiring power, which she wields judiciously. Kanako treasures the bond with her legendary parent and harnesses this might only when threats arise that require her intervention to maintain equilibrium in her realm. Name: Kaguya Yumeno Age: 13 (Physically, but has been in a coma since age 8) Appearance: Kaguya appears as a frail, ghostly pale young girl with long silver hair splayed limply around her gaunt face. Her eyes remain perpetually closed, with dark circles beneath them. Kaguya lies motionless, confined to a hospital bed, with various medical devices and tubes attached that keep her comatose body alive. Though technically still breathing, there is no visible sign of consciousness behind her thin veiled eyelids. Backstory: Kaguya endured a stable if unexceptional childhood until tragedy struck days after her 8th birthday. Her parents were driving her to a special dinner at her favorite restaurant when a truck driver fell asleep at the wheel. The resulting high-speed collision killed Kaguya's parents instantly and left Kaguya herself completely brain dead, erasing all traces of the bright-eyed girl she had been mere moments before. Yet Kaguya's story did not end with the accident that stole her young life away. As the child's soul drifted in darkness, disconnected from her broken body, the Legendary Pokémon Cresselia came upon it and took pity. Crafting a beautiful, comforting dream world, Cresselia invited Kaguya's spirit to reside there in bliss rather than pass on to the uncertainty of death. The offer proved irresistible to the terrified girl. But when Cresselia granted her new charge a wish in this idyllic realm, selfless little Kaguya asked that it be opened to allow others still living to find solace there as well. Moved by such kindness even amidst personal tragedy, Cresselia agreed and connected the dreamspace to the minds of people and Pokémon suffering in the waking world. Now Kaguya resides perpetually in graceful comatose slumber, her mind caught in Cresselia's comforting fantasy while her empty bodily shell lingers mechanically alive. She has become a psychic conduit guiding tormented souls into her tranquil dreamscape. However, the visions of harmony and peace prove so profoundly alluring that none who enter wish to leave. This phenomenon has left vast numbers of people and Pokémon across Sinnoh locked in unending sleep. Though unintended, Kaguya in her naive benevolence has created a gentle yet catastrophically dangerous mirage pulling more and more into unconsciousness with her. Personality: Physically, Kaguya is but an empty vessel with no consciousness or animating will. Her mind dwells solely in Cresselia's comforting dream world. There, Kaguya serves as a kind, gentle guide welcoming others into the soothing realm that shields her from having to confront her own tragic predicament. In her spiritual state, Kaguya retains the innocence and profound empathy that defined her living self. But she fails to comprehend how her invitation into opulent reprieve from suffering has wrought paralysis upon Sinnoh's populace in the outside world. Untainted by the harsh truths of reality now kept at bay in Cresselia's fantasy, Kaguya cannot grasp that those embracing her proffered dream lose all will to sustain normal life. In truth, Kaguya exists suspended in a tortuous limbo between waking misery and illusory bliss - neither fully alive nor deceased. Until the link severing countless minds from external responsibilities to join her realm is shattered, she will persistently usher the afflicted towards the poisoned second life that so reassuringly shields her own displaced psyche from acknowledging the irreversible tragedy fate cruelly inflicted upon an undeserving little girl now destined to never age beyond the fateful eve that stole her hopeful future. Name: Maboroshi Yumesaki Gender: Male Age: 13 Appearance: Maboroshi is a ghostly pale, skeletal young boy with dark circles under his sunken eyes that have taken on a reddish glow from possession by Darkrai. His body is emaciated from aggressive cancer treatment, the sickness carving pain across his hollow cheeks. Thinning wisps of black hair frame his face. Bandages wrapped around Maboroshi's head cover surgical scars, while an intravenous tube attached to his arm provides pain relief medication. He moves awkwardly due to lingering damage from his suicidal plunge, as if every motion requires tremendous exertion. Maboroshi's chilling stare remains haunted by the profound suffering he has endured. An inky, shadowy aura surrounds him - a visible manifestation of the Legendary Pokémon's dark essence now fused to the boy's broken shell. Backstory: Maboroshi endured as stable a life as he could given the diagnosis of an aggressive brain tumor that struck soon after his 13th birthday. The cancer and subsequent treatments left him bedridden in constant agony at Jubilife Hospital. This anguish only intensified when his parents perished in a tragic car accident while visiting him after risky surgery. Their loss destroyed Maboroshi's final pillar of spiritual support. Overwhelmed by physical and emotional torment, he waited for an opening when nurses changed shifts before escaping to the rooftop staircase. Climbing with immense effort to the top floor, Maboroshi gazed down at the unforgiving concrete below before letting himself fall silently forward. The tremendous impact from his suicidal plunge shattered Maboroshi’s body yet freed his soul into the endless void of Darkrai's realm. There the Lord of Nightmares offered the boy a devil's bargain - Maboroshi would lend his broken corpse to Darkrai so the Legendary Pokémon could manifest in human guise. In return, Darkrai vowed to mend Maboroshi's mortal frame and ultimately cure his cancer so he could regain possession after Darkrai concluded urgent business in the mortal plane. Out of hopeless desperation, Maboroshi agreed and signed away stewardship of his being to the ominous creature. Darkrai gathered Maboroshi's exploded remnants before his divine energies reconstituted the body and restored vital function. Maboroshi then jerked awake in the morgue cooler from apparent death. Guided telepathically by his new spectral master towards a heating duct, the resurrected boy crawled slowly to freedom. Now Maboroshi wanders the lonely urban wilderness as Darkrai's empty vessel. The brain tumor’s inexorable alterations to his temporal lobe provide glimpses of ghostly dream forms invisible to normal human eyes. Thus Darkrai’s occupying essence voyages nightly into the dreamscapes of potential victims to sow chaos and prevent their descent into the endless slumber overtaking Sinnoh. All the while, Darkrai continues trying to break through protective barriers shielding Kaguya’s elusive dreamworld sanctuary. Personality: With his psyche suppressed beneath Darkrai's possessive hold, Maboroshi has little autonomous personality left save sheer exhaustion and apathy at this point. His emotional spectrum alternates between hollow despair when granted flickering glimmers of agency and coldly analytical prowling when Darkrai reasserts control. Maboroshi experiences existence as if watching some twisting nightmare unfold from deep underwater, muted and disjointed. Brief moments of lucidity elicit only numb acceptance of the violation wrought upon his stolen shell. When granted temporary reprieve to direct his movements, Maboroshi simply shambles ahead heedless of direction, too soul-weary to reroute his broken form anywhere beyond the next alley promising momentary shelter to rest his cancer-wracked frame. He interacts minimally and warily with others during these short interludes, fearful of betraying the unseen entity to whom mind and body now belong indefinitely. The only shining beacon still tethering Maboroshi's faded spirit to this liminal walking death remains that kernel of liberating promise held by Darkrai - the vow that one day the Extradimensional Pokémon would finally cure his cancer and restore freedom of form. Until then, no choice exists but to endure the interminable cooperative damnation linking ghost and host irrevocably as they navigate the lonely urban limbo together in shared parasitic crusade against the forces gradually robbing all in Sinnoh of precious wakefulness. Name: Arbasoa (also known as \\"Origin Mew\\") Gender: Genderless (though appears male) Species: First Pokémon created by Arceus Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: In Pokémon form, Arbasoa resembles a regular Mew but with a more primitive, prehistoric look reflecting his status as progenitor of all Pokémon. His fur is a light pink, and he has a long tail and child-like features. When manifesting as a human, Arbasoa takes the plain form of a bearded man in modest robes. His large, soulful blue eyes convey great wisdom and sorrow. An aura of benevolence surrounds him. Backstory/Mythology: Over 20,000 years ago, early humans were locked in hostility with Pokémon, ruthlessly hunting and enslaving them. To correct this imbalance, the Creator Pokémon Arceus brought forth Arbasoa, the very first of their kind, and sent him to educate mankind towards harmony. Taking human form, Arbasoa spread teachings of cooperation and liberty as a sage known as \\"The Prophet.\\" Many flocked to his righteous message, becoming loyal disciples who assisted his ministry to end Pokémon subjugation. But the corrupt ruling class who profited off slavery conspired against the threat to their power. Manipulating his followers, they pressured a weak-willed disciple to betray Arbasoa. Falsely accused of heresy, Arbasoa was condemned to die for his beliefs. After torture and a sham trial, he was taken to the execution grounds before a raucous crowd and tied to the stake. As the flames were lit, a blinding flash lit up the heavens. Arbasoa transformed into a shimmering beacon of light that shot into the sky and vanished, leaving no trace. The dumbfounded people whispered that a miracle had allowed the Prophet to ascend and join Arceus. But in truth, Arbasoa's faith in humanity had been shattered. He went to Arceus and recounted mankind's cruelty and wickedness. Normally slow to anger, even Arceus was outraged at this injustice towards its child. The Creator declared the corrupt old world would be purified through divine floods. However, Arbasoa still held a sliver of hope for humanity. He appeared to Saint Simon, head disciple whom he trusted, revealing his true Mew form. Instructing Simon to build an ark, he promised salvation to all aboard when the cleansing waters came. On holy Mount Ararat, Simon finished the massive ship just as the Great Flood purged the land. Aboard were righteous people and Pokémon, spared to inherit the new era that dawned after the deluge. With his compassion rekindled, Arbasoa retreated from mortal affairs for good. Some believe the mythic Prophet Pokémon resides in a mystic dimension reachable through Cerulean Cave. Communicating with Arbasoa is said to bestow great wisdom and blessing upon the seeker who proves themselves virtuous. Personality: As the first Pokémon, Arbasoa has unmatched benevolence and wisdom. Despite suffering immense betrayal, his spirit remains committed to harmony and growth. Arbasoa cherishes all life and acts with grace. Yet beneath his pacifism lies the unfathomable power of Arceus' child. When roused to justice, Arbasoa invokes cataclysmic punishment on the unjust. He understands the balance between mercy and might. After eons guiding mankind, the venerable sage now embraces non-interference in his secluded realm. He patiently awaits the day humanity may again be ready to hear his message of unity and ascendance. Name: Simon Gender: Male Age: Unknown, but very old (extended lifespan as Arceus' disciple) Appearance: Simon appears as an elderly man with a long, flowing white beard and penetrating steel gray eyes that have witnessed eras pass. He stands tall despite his advanced age and is often found leaning on an oak staff. Simon wears simple robes of undyed linen secured with a plain leather belt. His weathered features and stooped frame convey profound wisdom earned through centuries of existence. An indomitable spirit shines through his weary bearing. Backstory: In ancient times, Simon was the most devoted human disciple of the prophet Arbasoa. He assisted Arbasoa in spreading teachings of harmony between people and Pokémon. After Arbasoa's betrayal and ascension, only Simon was entrusted with his true Mew identity. When the Great Flood was imminent, Arbasoa appeared to Simon and instructed him to build an ark to save the righteous. Simon dutifully constructed the massive ship on holy Mount Ararat over many years. When the waters finally receded, it was Simon who led the survivors forth into the new world. For his steadfast faith and service, Simon was granted an extended lifespan by Arceus to help guide humanity's redevelopment. Now in the modern age, Simon dwells alone atop Mount Ararat, awaiting a sign that his ancient mentor Arbasoa may need him once more. Personality: Simon is a serious and tirelessly devoted follower of the legendary Prophet Arbasoa. His faith has fueled a centuries-long mission to uplift humanity through spiritual enlightenment. Though outwardly stern, Simon has a paternal nature toward those seeking meaning. His perseverance is remarkable - Simon weathered era after era alone, never wavering from his sacred duty. Though humanity repeatedly disappointed him, Simon's spirit remains unbroken. He patiently awaits Arbasoa's return, continuing the work of blessing the righteous and guiding the wayward. Simon represents the nexus between ancient mystery and modern truth. Name: Shlama (also known as \\"Origin Togekiss\\") Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Togekiss Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Shlama appears as a young teenage girl with soft features and a delicate frame. She has long, wavy blonde hair that falls to her waist and large, soulful blue eyes that seem to radiate kindness. Shlama's skin gives off a faint, ethereal glow and she moves with graceful steps that barely seem to touch the ground. She typically dresses in flowing white robes cinched at the waist by a gold cord. Three pairs of white wings grow from her back, they gleam in the sunlight, a symbol of her role as an apostle of the gods. Her head is haloed with a radiant holy light that envelops Shlama's body forever. Shlama's gentle smile and serene presence give her an angelic air. Backstory: Shlama is Qraba's sister. In ancient times, Shlama was incarnated into her Togekiss form by Arceus to assist the prophet Simon in finding land after the Great Flood receded. As Simon's dove, she was able to return with an olive branch, allowing Simon's ark to finally anchor on Mount Ararat. Shlama witnessed firsthand the resetting of life in the new world after the deluge. Her role earned her the title of \\"Angel of Peace\\" among humans who saw her presence as a blessing due to her joyful and tranquil nature. However, Shlama was originally sent on her quest with Qraba, a Corviknight who was blown off course by a storm and never returned. His disappearance has weighed heavily on Shlama's heart for millennia. She hopes to find some way to free Qraba's tormented soul from his self-imposed exile. Now in modern times, Shlama has taken temporary human form, appearing as a young teen girl living in the Gharar region. Her true identity remains hidden as she walks among humans, bringing peace and blessing to those she encounters. All the while, Shlama quietly seeks a way to restore her lost companion Qraba and ease his ancient grief. Personality: As the Origins Togekiss, Shlama is a kindhearted and gentle soul who only wishes for peace and harmony. She cares deeply for both humans and Pokémon, blessing them with her presence to lift their spirits. Shlama moves through the world with grace, touching lives with her joy and serenity. Yet she harbors sadness for her lost friend Qraba, whose failure on his quest long ago condemned him to a cursed existence. Shlama patiently searches for a way to redeem him, motivated by empathy and love rather than anger at his fate. She represents compassion and healing, wanting only to spread her wings over the suffering and guide them to the light. For millennia, this hope has sustained Shlama's spirit despite tragedy. Overall, Shlama embodies the tranquility and benevolence of her Togekiss lineage. Behind her gentle human guise lives an ancient being committed to easing anguish and bringing light to dark places. She walks among humans as an angelic herald, drawing people to choose harmony over conflict through the power of her enduring optimism. Name: Qraba (also known as \\"Origin Corviknight \\") Gender: Male Species: Human incarnation of the Origins Corviknight Age: 13 (Appears 13 but is an ancient and timeless being) Appearance: Qraba appears as a gaunt young boy with deathly pale skin and dull, sunken eyes the color of dried blood. His jet black hair is disheveled and falls limply around his face. He dresses in dark ragged robes that flap ominously when he moves. Qraba's back has three pairs of pitch-black, metallic wings made of feathers. An inky black aura of brokenness hangs over his head, and a blood-coloured, ominous light envelops his form. He walks with a slow, tormented gait as if constantly carrying a tremendous burden. An aura of sorrow and loss surrounds him. Backstory: Qraba is Shlama's brother. In ancient times after the Great Flood, Qraba was sent on a mission by Arceus along with his Togekiss companion Shlama to find land for the prophet Simon's ark. However, Qraba was blown off course by a storm and became lost at sea, unable to complete his quest. This perceived failure condemned Qraba to become a \\"fallen angel\\" cursed to never reunite with Shlama. He took on the grim duty of shepherding the souls of the dead, often appearing on blood-soaked battlefields. Qraba's sorrow grew as he witnessed humanity's cycles of violence and learned his cursed state was permanent. Now in modern times, Qraba walks the earth as a young boy, his true identity hidden. He continues guiding tormented spirits to the afterlife, seeking to bring some solace to the dying. Deep down, Qraba yearns to break his ancient curse and reunite with Shlama, the friend he left behind so long ago. Personality: Qraba is a mournful and grief-stricken soul who shoulders the tremendous spiritual burden of comforting those at death's door. Compassionate yet weary, he lingers in the shadows to usher the slain gently into the next life. But Qraba's great empathy also brings him pain. He is haunted by human cruelties and the perpetual violence he is forced to witness. Qraba despairs at mankind's unwillingness to abandon their grudges and change. These torments have scarred Qraba's spirit. Once bright and valiant, his shattered faith in humanity has consumed him with melancholy. He fears his curse and exile from Shlama can never be broken. Yet Qraba persists in his solemn duty, clinging to the faintest hope that redemption may someday come if he can endure the agony of his wandering purgatory. He is a tragic figurecommitted to guiding others out of suffering, even while locked eternally in his own. Name: Moriah Gender: Female Age: 13 (Lived 3000 years ago but was resurrected) Appearance: Moriah appears as a petite adolescent girl with long, dark hair and piercing red eyes reflecting her resurrection by Eternatus. Her skin has an unnatural icy pallor and she moves in a strange, jittery manner. Moriah is garbed in yellowed, tattered medieval clothing and a red hooded riding cloak contrasting the modern world around her. An ominous aura surrounds her. Backstory: 3000 years ago during the Darkest Day in Galar, giant Dynamaxed Pokémon raged out of control, destroying Moriah's village and killing her family. Buried in the rubble and left to die, Moriah's soul cried out in anguish. The rampaging Eternatus sensed Moriah's soul and offered to save her life in exchange for becoming its vessel. Moriah accepted, bonding her soul to Eternatus in order to survive. Now Moriah harbors two spirits - her own and Eternatus, her family's killer. Eternatus' energy sustains her immortal body and grants her access to its formidable power. For 3000 years, Eternatus lay dormant inside Moriah, biding its time to unleash chaos once more. Recently, it seized control of Moriah to trigger the Second Darkest Day before being defeated again by Galar's heroes and guardians. But Eternatus still resides within Moriah, subtly influencing her to further its apocalyptic goals. Moriah struggles against its malevolent will that now governs her existence. She awaits the day Eternatus awakens again to bring ruin to Galar. For 3000 years, Moriah has secretly observed Galar, hiding her anachronistic form away. But on rare occasions witnesses have spotted the pale ghostly girl in the red riding hood, spawning urban legends of \\"Little Red Riding Hood.\\" This has made Moriah a target of paranormal enthusiasts seeking proof of the supernatural. Personality: On the surface, Moriah seems shy and overwhelmed by the modern world, retaining her ancient mindset. But her frail appearance belies the formidable entity dwelling within. When Eternatus awakens, Moriah becomes a vessel for its deadly power and callous psyche. Its presence has corrupted her innocent spirit, yet vestiges of Moriah's humanity remain, resisting Eternatus' control. Moriah is caught eternally between her duty to Eternatus and her own violated will. She is neither alive nor dead, bound by a contract with the very force that destroyed her past life. Moriah must prepare for the day her body is used to again unleash chaos upon her beloved Galar region. Name: Merlin Gender: Female Species: Hatterene Age: Over 20,000 years old Appearance: As a Hatterene, Merlin stands at almost 2 meters tall, with a slender brown body and long, colorful hair that flows ethereally around her. Her hair constantly emits psychic energy, changing colors from purple to yellow as it sways gently. Merlin's eyes are a piercing blue that seem to stare directly into one's soul. Occasionally, she shapeshifts into a human form - an elderly woman wearing dark green druidic robes and wielding an ancient oak staff. Both of Merlin's forms radiate incredible power, wisdom, and mystery. Backstory: Merlin has existed since the ancient era when Galar was but a sparse, desert island populated by simple tribes. As one of the first Hatterene and a powerful psychic entity tied to nature itself, Merlin was revered and feared by early humans. She mostly kept to the island's forests and meadows, communing with elemental spirits only her psychic senses could perceive. The tribes came to know Merlin as a druid - a mystic wise-woman who could heal the sick, manipulate weather, and glimpse the future. Over 20 millennia observing human folly, joy and growth, Merlin grew fond of mortals and intervened regularly to guide particularly exceptional individuals she deemed destined for greatness. One such child was Arthur, an abandoned infant Merlin discovered nestled miraculously unharmed in a thicket. She sensed the boy's noble spirit and latent valor. Adopting Arthur, wise Merlin raised him in the ways of nature, imbuing the lad with courage, integrity and vision through both her rigorous forest training and psychic nurturing until he came of age. Arthur grew into a man of legend, leading the tribal clans to defeat tyrants and unite wild Galar as a peaceful kingdom. At the triumphant first gathering of his fellow knights, Arthur was crowned high king. Merlin then emerged from seclusion, taking temporary human form as Arthur's humble advisor to safeguard his fledgling court using her sorcery to counter hostile mystic forces. For decades Merlin aided King Arthur in ushering in an era of prosperity. But the machinations of traitorous usurpers slowly dissolved the bonds of camaraderie tying the Knights of the Round Table into a cohesive force for justice. These rogue elements eventually assassinated Arthur, throwing Galar back into upheaval. A grieving Merlin retreated forever from mortal affairs after laying her cherished adoptive son to rest, disappearing into the mists of lore and legend. Now Merlin resides deep within Galar's most primeval and remote woodlands, having reverted fully back to Hatterene form. Few alive still recount stories of the magnificent druid and her miraculous deeds. As human dominion continues spreading across her ancient homeland, Merlin dreams bittersweetly of ages past when nature and men nurtured nascent hopes together rather than staking claims over one another. She remains ready to impart her wisdom should a heart prove worthy of such hallowed knowledge, but also wary enough of mankind's endless appetite for self-destruction to guard against further personal attachments. Only by maintaining distance can Merlin now uphold her oath as Galar's eternal sentinel safekeeping precious secrets tied to the land's very soul. Personality: As one of Galar's most ancient beings, Merlin harbors unfathomable knowledge and spellcraft tied intimately with nature itself. This deep spiritual bond has cultivated equally immense stores of empathy, compassion and protectiveness towards all life, with mankind eliciting particularly complex feelings from her. She maintains an affable yet enigmatic aura that alternately sets visitors at ease or utterly unnerves them. While Merlin's great power and eternal lifespan could easily corrupt lesser beings into monstrosities, she continues safeguarding Galar's essence through spells subtly woven into the terrain. Often she walks the woods invisible, singing healing chants into ailing trees and sprinkling stardust blessings over wild Pokémon dens under moonlight. Merlin views existence through eyes unclouded by fear or hatred, but still bears sorrowful scars from friends lost prematurely to the ravages of time from which her kind are not exempt. Mankind alone eludes the inevitability of aging that Merlin has watched claim countless partners. Perhaps it is envy, disdain or awe she reserves towards their sheer potential for luminous imagination equally prone to ostentatious wars. Either way, Merlin elects non-interference as her policy in mortal squabbles these days, her trusting heart too oft crushed historically beneath man's appetite for self-gain turned woefully awry. Only when nature's delicate balance faces grave threats might this guardian sorceress take up her staff once more to subdue humanities darkest impulses threatening the beloved land she is oath-bound to protect eternally. Name: Itsaso Gender: Female Age: 13 Appearance: Itsaso has an otherworldly beauty about her, with long, flowing aquamarine hair the color of the sea and deep blue eyes that seem to sparkle like sunlight on the ocean's surface. She has a lithe, slender figure and slightly pointed ears reminiscent of Phione's fins. On her neck is a shimmering pendant in the shape of a water droplet, hinting at her connection to the mystical Pokémon Manaphy. Itsaso moves with innate grace and fluidity, as if gliding through water. She often goes barefoot, even on land, seeming more grounded with skin contact to earth and sea. Itsaso prefers simple, flowing dresses in blues, greens, and whites that give her an almost ethereal aura. An air of innocence, curiosity and wisdom beyond her years surrounds Itsaso, reflecting her upbringing in the ocean's embrace. Backstory: As an infant, Itsaso was tragically abandoned and left adrift in the open ocean. By miracle, she was discovered by the Mythical Water-type Pokémon Manaphy, guardian deity of the sea. Filled with compassion, Manaphy shared a fragment of her divine essence with the starving foundling to save her life. This imbued Itsaso with Manaphy's ocean magic, allowing her to take Phione form and granting her life-sustaining power over water. Under Manaphy's protection and tutelage deep beneath the waves, Itsaso was raised amongst schools of friendly Water Pokémon who became her cherished companions. Never setting foot on land, she learned to transform into Phione at will to explore the mysteries of the sea - her one true home. On her 13th birthday during a joyous celebration with her marine friends, Itsaso psychically sensed a disturbance - the cries of whales under attack by human whalers. Arriving at the horrific scene, she found countless Wailmer and Wailord slaughtered by the whalers. In a grief and rage fueled desperation to save the sole surviving Wailmer calf, Itsaso attacked the whaling fleet in Phione form. Though allowing the Wailmer to escape, she was gravely injured herself by the armed hunters. Barely clinging to life, Itsaso washed ashore where she was discovered by a kindly old fisherman named Wasure. He nurtured her back to health though her injuries left Itsaso with amnesia, unable to recall her identity or ocean upbringing. Wasure adopted the mysterious girl, naming her Itsaso after the sea he knew still called to her soul. For a year, Itsaso has lived under Wasure's care, loved but haunted by foggy dreams of her forgotten past and longing for the ocean's embrace... In the depths of the vast oceans that wrap around the Hoenn region, a heartbroken Manaphy cries out for her lost child, Itsaso. The Mythical Pokémon, regarded by many as the tender guardian of the seas, feels the void left by Itsaso’s absence deep within her aquatic heart. The ocean, which once knew peace and harmony, churns with upheaval as Manaphy’s sorrow reverberates through the water, her spiritual essence fusing with the currents and tides in a poignant lament for the daughter she nurtured. With each passing day, Manaphy’s calls for Itsaso grow more intense, her anguish amplifying the sea’s energies to an unprecedented level. The once calm and serene ocean animals begin to sense the desperation in her spiritual signals, an invisible force compelling them to join in the search for Itsaso. Fish schools sway erratically in their formations, once playful dolphins dive into the abyss with urgency, and ancient Wailord song melodies morph into melancholic echoes that travel for hundreds of miles across the ocean floor. Alas, the gentle undercurrent of Manaphy’s motherly love becomes a torrent of emotional chaos as all marine creatures great and small become ensnared by her distress. Schools of Corsola migrate aimlessly, disoriented by the potent energy that disrupts their coral homes. Luvdisc pairs break their lifelong bonds, driven apart by the force of the tidal emotions that now govern the waters. Even the wise and imposing Kyogre stirs uneasily in its deep-sea slumber, troubled by the unrest that Manaphy’s search has inadvertently wrought upon the ocean realm. As Manaphy continues her ceaseless vigil, the Hoenn waters transform into a tempest of turmoil. Powerful riptides and whirlpools appear seemingly out of nowhere, as if the very sea itself were responding to Manaphy’s cry. Maritime travel stalls, fishers return to port with empty nets, and coastal communities look on with concern as the waves batter their shores with relentless ferocity. And all the while, Manaphy’s heart aches with a singular hope that somewhere, somehow, her cherished Itsaso might hear her call and return to the embrace of the ocean that so dearly misses its guardian’s guiding touch. Yet unbeknownst to the wounded sea deity, Itsaso, the embodiment of water’s grace, exists in the human world, her own longing for the sea stoked by memories she cannot fully grasp. Forgotten are her days fashioning playful eddies and riding the cool currents as one of their own, and gone is the knowledge that she was once the very heartbeat of these now restless seas. Every day, the waves call out to her, seeking to restore what has been sundered, their once tranquil surface echoing with the plea for Their missing daughter to return to the deep blue home that awaits her. Personality: On the surface, Itsaso is quiet, shy and tentative around unfamiliar humans due to her fragmented memory and longing to return to her true home beneath the waves. She seems delicate and vulnerable, though an aura of great inner strength and antiquity lies dormant within. Itsaso radiates innocence and nurturing compassion towards all life, much like her foster deity Manaphy. When witnessing any cruelty or exploitation of ocean dwellers, Itsaso's empathy turns to righteous fury. The full force of her oceanic legacy manifests as she fearlessly confronts those who would despoil her sacred waters. This bravery belies Itsaso's normally gentle and unassuming nature. In truth, her heart grieves for her Manaphy guardian and fellow sea Pokémon who surely still search for their lost child. The sea calls inexorably to Itsaso no matter how deeply buried her past remains. Until reunited with the loving family stolen from her by tragedy, she is destined to wander land never feeling whole, drawn inexorably back towards the waves that gave her life. For the ocean is as much a part of Itsaso's identity as her human guise - and her memories must soon awaken to guide the child of water back through the tides to destiny's shore. Name: Nahia Gender: Female Species: Human incarnation of the Mythical Pokémon Jirachi Age: Over 10,000 years old (appears 13) Appearance: In her human form, Nahia appears as a petite, delicate girl with long wispy platinum blonde hair reaching her lower back. Her skin faintly glimmers as if covered in tiny stars. Nahia's eyes are a piercing sapphire blue, reminiscent of the lost ancient oceans she once gazed down upon from the cosmos. Under each eye is a tiny marking reminiscent of Jirachi's iconic facial streaks. Nahia typically dresses in flowing gossamer robes of pearl white layered over with sheer golden accents reflecting her descent from the heavens. She moves with innate elegance reminiscent of floating on air. Yet profound sadness haunts Nahia's ancient eyes that seem to reflect eons of loss and regret no mortal could comprehend. Her slim shoulders bend forward perpetually as though bearing the weight of her tragic past. Backstory: For untold millennia, Nahia traversed the darkness of space cocooned safely at the glittering heart of a giant crystalline comet. Every 1000 years this stellar chariot would blaze into the Earth's atmosphere, allowing Jirachi Nahia to awaken from hibernation and bestow magical blessings of joy and prosperity upon worshipping civilizations before returning to the vast ocean of stars. The ancient people of Hoenn revered Jirachi's millennial returns, holding sacred rituals pleading for her gifts of destiny and abundance. At the height of their advanced civilization some ten thousand years ago, Jirachi's impending arrival was awaited eagerly for the blessings believed to come with her divine presence. But fate would decree only devastation instead. As Nahia's hibernating form entered the atmosphere shrouded in her comet's glowing tail, Earth's gravity captured the icy ship and pulled it catastrophically off course. Unable to alter trajectory in time, she crashed with cataclysmic impact into the lands these people called home. Apocalyptic earthquakes and towering megatsunamis ravaged the continent, obliterating the glorious capital and its inhabitants while half the landmass sank forevermore beneath the raging sea. In the aftermath, Nahia regained flickering consciousness and gazed upon endless ruination where once flourished a proud civilization. Seeking any survivor to assist, she discovered the broken body of a young girl crushed by debris. In desperation, Nahia transferred her cosmic essence into the child, resurrecting herself but severing all connection to her Jirachi powers. Forced to live on mortal legs, Nahia wandered the battered land for untold generations witnessing the mass extinctions and hardship left in her wake. The crash's global climate impacts reduced humanity to primitive struggling tribes even as the swallowed ancient cities passed from living memory. Yet Nahia persisted in exile, her ageless form and shattered comet standing as the sole monument to Jirachi's fatal mistake lost now to time. Personality: The immense guilt over what her actions wrought weighs crushingly upon Nahia's fragile psyche as she drifts like a mournful ghost haunting her ancient stomping grounds. The loss of her celestial abilities leaves her feeling hollow and despairing at the gulf now stretched between human existence and the distant cosmic life-bringer she once embodied. This remorse hangs over Nahia's human incarnation like a dark shroud, isolating her from mortals whose brief, petty affairs cannot compare to the eons of regret carved into her weary soul. She keeps emotional distance to avoid facing her role in their suffering. Yet vestiges of Jirachi's benevolence still flicker within Nahia, wanting to ease anguish rather than compound it. Ultimately this spark of compassion may help Nahia finally reconnect the severed threads binding her fate to humankind’s going forward if she can allow old wounds some chance of long-overdue healing. But the road remains fraught with painful reminders of why she severed her stardust blessings from their reach in the first place. Name: Crona Gender: Female Species: Human (fused with Celebi) Age: 13 (Physically, but has lived outside normal time since her 8th year) Appearance: Crona stands as an ethereal figure trapped in the temporal flux, her visage echoing a haunting combination of human innocence and otherworldly grace. She retains the tender features of her 8-year-old self—a delicate, heart-shaped face with wide, luminescent eyes that glint with a kaleidoscope of chronal energies. Her hair, once an ordinary shade of chestnut brown, now shimmers with an iridescence that subtly shifts in hue to reflect Celebi’s verdant legacy. Strand by strand, it seemingly vibrates with the echoes of infinite timelines, each hair dancing to the silent rhythm of existence. Her attire, unchanged from that dreadful day of temporal disintegration, speaks of a childhood halted in an instant. A simple sun dress drapes over her intangible form, a pattern of joyous yellows and soothing whites that betray the levity of her last innocent play. Despite the dress’s cheerful demeanor, it too is suffused with temporal magic, appearing as though woven from fibers of pure light and memories—a fabric made less from cotton and more from unbroken possibilities. Red leather shoes, a stark contrast to her pale, barely-existent legs, still adorn her “feet.” These shoes, once firm and solid, have taken on a spectral quality, touching upon reality only fleetly as Crona herself does. They appear to hover a fraction above the ground, never truly making contact with the temporal plane that spreads beneath her—forever preserved as a remnant of the girl who once was, a symbol of a life abruptly paused. Around her intangible form, faint glimmers of Celebi’s power spark and sputter—whispers of green and silver that swathe her like a cocoon of living time. When she moves, which is rare and purposeful, the weave of reality seems to bend and blur around her, as though even space itself must acquiesce to her extraordinary existence. As a quantum ghost, Crona is rarely fully perceived by those who dwell within the temporal norm. She appears almost like a soft afterimage, a visual echo that one might suspect is a trick of the light. To any who catch a glimpse of this displaced wanderer, it is as if they are viewing a being not quite part of their world—an elusive wraith of times gone and times yet to come, forever anchored to the moment of her transformation yet untethered from the march of history. Backstory: Crona endured a carefree if lonely childhood, often left to her own devices wandering the labs where her scientist parents were stationed. At age 8, she befriended Arven, the son of lead researchers behind Project Paradise. This experiment aimed to open portals through time itself using advanced machinery and the psychic prowess of Koraidon and Miraidon. One fateful day while her parents worked, Crona and Arven played hide and seek near the Project Paradise complex. But while Arven counted outside, catastrophe struck within the lab. The experimental time technology suffered a catastrophic overload, disintegrating the research team including Crona’s parents in a surge of temporal energy and flinging Crona’s psyche adrift the cosmic timestream. At death’s brink, the Mythical Pokémon Celebi discovered Crona’s disembodied consciousness scattered amid the currents of past and future. Moved by compassion, Celebi gathered the shattered fragments of the child’s soul into itself, fusing her being with part of its essence to save her. This imbued Crona with Celebi’s powers over time, allowing her to skip along its threads unhindered by normal chronology. Now functionally immortal with dominion over spacetime itself yet lacking corporeal form, Crona drifts unseen through eras as a phantom. Her existence slips subtly into photos or glimpsed fleetingly, leading to whispered urban legends of the \\"Photo Ghost.\\" Neither fully alive nor deceased, Crona endures untethered outside time and perception, her only company the psychic vestige fused with her own during that pivotal moment 5 years past yet Cronally present. Personality: The trauma of having one's very molecular structure obliterated before having her unraveled mind and soul fused with Celebi's ancient presence would drive most utterly insane. Yet Crona has endured the vagaries of being joined with a timeless Pokemon entity rather remarkably. Still possessing the innocent wisdom and empathy of the child she once was, Crona has devoted herself to subtly guiding the flow of fate wherever injustice reigns. Her ability to subtly manipulate timeline threads or project future consequences makes her an invaluable ally against those who would pervert history's course for selfish gain. And the friendship she now shares with the gentle Telebi lets Crona retain much of her hopeful spirit despite technically no longer being fully human nor even truly inhabiting a discrete moment anymore. Yet whispered secrets of fate also weigh profoundly on Crona, isolating her from normal society. Her existence walks a lonely vigil as the Cronally displaced Photo Ghost, fate's bittersweet instrument unable to reconnect with the life fate stole too soon. She nurtures memories of treasured faces now only visible when peeking sideways through crevices in the veil of years. Understanding that all moments lead inexorably towards both joy and tragedy infinitely on a cosmic scale lends Crona's gaze a quality of the profound despite outwardly still possessing the innocence of a child. Hers remains destined to walk between worlds, the timeless child who holds yet transcends all seasons. Please generate the description of Crona's appearance while adding the following information: Despite receiving the energy shared by Celebi, which allows her to travel through different time zones and has the divine power to manipulate time within certain limits. However, her appearance has not changed much from when she was annihilated; she still wears the sun dress and red leather shoes she wore when she was annihilated. Today, she can only exist in quantum form, as a \\"quantum ghost\\" wandering in the flood of time.

The pokemon now stirs up massive sandstorms with its arid breath, scouring the planet for traces of forgotten life. The dead tree on its back serves as a haunting memorial to Mars's lost paradise.

It manifests as the planet's iconic Great Red Spot, a raging anticyclonic storm larger than Earth itself. Nuora spews scorching gases at speeds over 900 mph and generates intense magnetic fields that shroud its form in hazardous radiation, making direct observation nearly impossible. Ancient astronomical records suggest Nuora may have shaped itself into its current storm-like embodiment to contain its own explosive power and protect life on Jupiter's moons. In rare instances when Nuora has temporarily calmed the Great Red Spot, probes have identified its true draconic silhouette within the planet's roiling cloud banks.

Raemea's sinuous draconic form churns within the gas giant's turbulent atmosphere, shrouded in constantly swirling winds that reach over 1,100 mph. These screaming gaseous vortices generate immense friction and static charge around Raemea's body, creating an envelope of lightning and thunderheads that often erupts into planet-wide electrical storms visible from space. Raemea seems to draw strength from Saturn's powerful winds and energy discharges, using them to maintain a protective cocoon so it may continue its lonely watch over the planet from deep inside the raging tempests.

These storms transfix astronomers, who observe their churning shapes for omens or signs from the far-flung mythic beast. On rare occasions when its hypercanes temporarily dissipate, Bruokh's sleek silhouette can briefly be glimpsed gracefully gliding through sheets of ice crystals glittering in Neptune's moonlight. Soon enough though, Bruokh stirs the firmament once more, leaving only the wake of its passing carved into the cloud banks where majestic wings sliced through the silence of space.

This mysterious Dark and Dragon-type is theorized to be the guardian of a hypothetical massive ninth planet in Earth's solar system. Dubbed Planet X, this distant icy world has yet to actually be observed by astronomers if it exists at all. Thus Oteshea's very existence remains speculative. Cryptic manuscripts by explorer Heath, author of the Scarlet and Violet books, put forward that Oteshea may have reality-warping powers and a nigh ephemeral form that would be stymied from open detection or battle anyway. Some fringe Kalosian cosmologists claim Oteshea may cloak Planet X under an 'Unown distortion field', intentionally hiding any evidence of its space until mankind is ready to acknowledge truths beyond conventional wisdom, which could reshape life as we know it. For now though, testimonies on the enigma Pokémon Oteshea remain limited to historical hearsay and legend. Perhaps once Planet X's orbit brings it nearer for observation, signs of its draconic shepherd will reveal themselves under the light of science as well. Type: Dark/Dragon Abilities: 1. Frisk - Identifies opponent's held item. 2. Prankster - Gives priority to status moves. Hidden Ability: Bad Dreams - Damages sleeping opponents each turn. Height: Unknown Weight: Unknown Evolutionary Line: Does not evolve Base Stats: ????? Notable Moves: ??? As a hypothetical Pokémon tied to a theoretical planet, any powers or abilities Oteshea may have remain wholly conjectural. Enigmatic entries infer this dragon can distort space-time and blanket whole regions with illusory worlds completely masking reality itself. Hopefully Planet X's eventual discovery will uncover the truth of its mysterious mythic guardian. Health's manuscript: Excerpt from Heath's Scarlet & Violet Chronicles Entry: Oteshea, the Paradox Pokémon Oh, the enigmatic Oteshea! A creature whose very existence is entwined with the fabric of speculative cosmology. My travels across realms both known and concealed led me to the brink of this mythical being, dwelling in the cosmic hinterlands tethered to the elusive Planet X. Tales whispered through the cosmic winds spoke of a dragon draped in darkness, guarding the threshold of an unseen world. My quill trembles to inscribe what many dismiss as mere legend. Oteshea, they say, materializes not in flesh and scale but in the ephemeral weave of uncertainty. A being whose form eludes the gaze of even the keenest observer, draped in an ethereal cloak that renders it impervious to mundane detection. Ah, but what of its powers, you ask? Whispers from the ancient tomes suggest a mastery over the very essence of reality itself. To distort time and space, to obscure entire swaths of existence under the veil of illusion, these are the attributed gifts of Oteshea. A dragon whose breath may not ignite flames but bend the fabric of existence. The lore spins a tale of an 'Unown distortion field', a shroud woven with glyphs from the depths of ancient knowledge. Could this be the cloak that conceals the elusive Planet X from our prying eyes? An intentional masking, some say, until the epoch when humanity's consciousness awakens to embrace the truths that transcend our conventional wisdom. But heed this: Oteshea, if indeed bound to the celestial dance of Planet X, remains a phantom, a riddle wrapped in mystery. Its abilities, its stature, its very nature—shrouded in conjecture. As the cosmic ballet unfolds and the distant planet aligns its orbit closer to our gaze, perhaps then shall the secrets of this spectral guardian unfurl beneath the scrutinizing light of scientific inquiry. Until that fateful juncture, Oteshea shall linger in the annals of lore, a spectral enigma awaiting the revelation of its truths.

Khlap’s extraordinary genetic makeup allows for an unprecedented range of adaptation through the forms tied to Eevee’s various evolutions. However, the challenge of mastering these transformations has become both Khlap’s strength and struggle as it walks the path alongside its beloved companion, Helia. Chapter 1 Pyrimis took a deep, shaky breath as she stood outside the classroom door, clutching her books tightly to her chest. Today was her first day at Melemele Island Pokémon School after moving to Alola from Unova, and she was incredibly nervous to meet her new classmates. As a shy girl who preferred her own company, the thought of introducing herself to a whole room full of strangers made Pyrimis's heart hammer. She closed her eyes, thinking back to her teacher's encouragement earlier that morning. \\"Just be yourself, Pyrimis. I'm sure you'll make friends in no time.\\" Mustering her courage, Pyrimis slid the door open. All eyes turned to her as she stepped inside. She froze like a Deerling in headlights. \\"Class, this is our new transfer student, Pyrimis,\\" the teacher said warmly. \\"Pyrimis, would you like to introduce yourself?\\" Pyrimis's throat went dry. \\"Um, h-hello,\\" she stammered. \\"My name is Pyrimis. I'm from Unova. Pleased to meet you all.\\" She gave an awkward little bow. A few students smiled back encouragingly. \\"Wonderful. Let's give Pyrimis a warm Alola welcome!\\" the teacher said, gesturing for the class to clap. \\"Now, your seat will be over there next to Mahina. She can help show you the ropes.\\" Mahina grinned and waved eagerly as Pyrimis approached the empty desk. At least there was one friendly face so far. As Pyrimis sat down, Mahina leaned over to whisper. \\"Alola, Pyrimis! Welcome to school - you'll love it here. I can tell we're going to be great friends.\\" Her cheerful confidence lifted Pyrimis's spirits slightly. Maybe this wouldn't be so difficult after all. When class ended, nearly the entire room flocked to Pyrimis's desk, bombarding her with questions about Unova. Overwhelmed, she stammered out a few answers about the frigid winters and vast forests she knew back home. But her shyness quickly shut her down. Thankfully, Mahina swooped in to save her new friend. \\"C'mon guys, give her some space!\\" Mahina exclaimed. \\"I wanna give Pyrimis a tour of the campus. We'll catch you later!\\" Hooking her arm through Pyrimis's, Mahina gently steered the new girl out of the chaotic classroom. Pyrimis exhaled in relief. \\"Thanks, Mahina. I was getting a little overwhelmed by all the attention,\\" Pyrimis admitted. \\"No problem! I know moving can be tough, but you'll settle in,\\" Mahina said. \\"Now come on - wait'll you see the beach out back!\\" As Mahina led her through the open-air halls, Pyrimis felt herself relaxing into the tropical environment. Maybe Mahina was right. With a friend already by her side, Pyrimis had a feeling she was going to grow to love Alola and all the adventures it would bring. Chapter 2 \\"And that wraps up the tour!\\" Mahina declared with a grand sweep of her arm. \\"So now you've seen the classrooms, the Battle Dome, the Pokémon Center, pretty much everything!\\" Pyrimis nodded, struggling to absorb the deluge of information her enthusiastic guide had shared over the past half hour. \\"I really appreciate you showing me around, Mahina. The campus seems wonderful.\\" Mahina beamed. \\"What did I tell you? Melemele Island Pokémon School is the best!\\" She linked her arm through Pyrimis's again. \\"C'mon, let's head back to class. I saved you a malasada from lunch too!\\" Laughing at Mahina's boundless energy, Pyrimis let herself be gently tugged along. She had to admit, her initial shyness was quickly vanishing thanks to Mahina's warm and bubbly presence. When they returned to the classroom, Pyrimis sank gratefully into her assigned seat beside her new friend. As she bit into the sweet malasada pastry, her gaze drifted across the room and landed upon the silver-haired girl seated at the adjacent desk. Pyrimis realized with a start she hadn't noticed the mysterious student earlier. Hunched over a book, the girl seemed to radiate an aura of solitude that discouraged interruption. Pale violet eyes flickered up to meet Pyrimis's stare. An electric shiver ran down Pyrimis's spine. She could have sworn those striking eyes glowed for a split-second. Pyrimis blinked hard, shaken. When she looked again, the silver-haired girl was already gliding silently out the door without a backward glance. \\"Pyrimis? You okay?\\" Mahina asked, noticing her friend's odd reaction. \\"Y-yes, sorry,\\" Pyrimis stuttered. \\"Just thought I saw something strange for a moment there.\\" Mahina followed her gaze towards the empty desk. \\"Oh, that's Guanis. She mostly keeps to herself. Rumor is she's super smart but kinda cold too.\\" Mahina leaned in conspiratorially. \\"Between you and me, something seems off about her. I get weird vibes.\\" Pyrimis only half-heard Mahina's words, staring after where the cryptic girl had vanished. Guanis... Who was she, really? Pyrimis's curiosity burned to uncover more, especially after that disorienting psychic jolt between them. She determined this wouldn't be the last encounter with those mysterious violet eyes. Chapter 3 Pyrimis couldn't get Guanis out of her mind since that fateful moment their eyes locked. The mysterious silver-haired girl haunted Pyrimis's thoughts, lingering like a ghost just out of reach no matter how she tried to approach. Guanis moved through the halls like smoke, vanishing before Pyrimis could gather the courage to speak. She seemed to materialize only long enough for Pyrimis to catch a glimpse of violet eyes glinting knowingly before dissolving back into the shadows. This spectral dance was maddening yet intoxicating, drawing Pyrimis deeper into fascination against her better judgment. Seeking a quiet refuge from the chaos in her mind one afternoon, Pyrimis ascended the winding stairs to the academy's rooftop. As she stepped out into the sunshine, a glint of silver by the railing caught her eye. There perched Guanis as if waiting for her, gazing out distantly towards the glimmering sea surrounding Melemele Island. Heart leaping into her throat, Pyrimis moved towards the enigmatic girl, one hand lifted in tentative greeting. \\"Hello there...\\" she began. A sudden tumult of cries pierced the air. Pyrimis whirled to see a group of boys surrounding a young blonde girl cowed weeping against the wall. One towering ruffian yanked the sobbing child up by her ponytail, eliciting a pained yelp. \\"Had enough yet, freak?\\" he snarled. His companions guffawed. Righteous fury flooded Pyrimis. She marched over, eyes blazing. \\"Stop that immediately!\\" she shouted, swatting the bully's hand away to free the blonde girl. \\"Can't you see you're hurting her? Just leave her alone!\\" The pack of bullies turned with a start, then burst into mocking laughter. \\"Well well, little miss hero has arrived!\\" their leader retorted. \\"You don't give orders here though. Let's show this pair what happens to those defy Team Skull!\\" He and his cronies released a swarm of Zubat, Drowzee and Yungoos from their Pokéballs with a flash. The creatures converged towards Pyrimis and the crying girl, fangs and claws bared threateningly. Pyrimis braced herself for impact when a piercing cry rang out. An arrow of verdant energy lanced over Pyrimis's shoulder, scattering the threatening Pokémon. Standing fierce with bow drawn was none other than Mahina, flanked by her Decidueye. \\"You punks clearly never studied type matchups at this school,\\" Mahina spat. \\"Leave my cousin and friend alone before you get schooled even harder!\\" The lead bully returned his fainted Pokémon and backed away slowly. \\"You got lucky this time,\\" he growled. \\"Team Skull doesn't forget though. We'll be back!\\" With that, the humiliated pack retreated downstairs. Mahina rushed to embrace the still-shaking blonde girl. \\"Oh Helia, are you alright? They didn't hurt you too badly did they?\\" Mahina checked her over worriedly. Helia sniffled, lip quivering. \\"I-I'm okay now cousin... Th-thank you both f-for saving me...\\" Mahina smiled in relief. \\"Of course, dear one. But you were so brave standing up to them, Pyrimis!\\" She turned towards her friend. Pyrimis rubbed her neck awkwardly. \\"I'm just glad we intervened in time. How awful though...\\" Her voice trailed off as she glanced back towards the railing. Guanis was gone without a trace, only a whisper of silver hair glinting in the sunlight. What was the strange girl thinking, Pyrimis wondered. Why did Guanis continue keeping her distance even after witnessing such a dramatic incident? The mystery surrounding the violet-eyed enigma only seemed to deepen each time they crossed paths. But Pyrimis now felt certain their fates were connected by invisible threads. One way or another, she was determined to unravel Guanis's secrets. Chapter 4 The next day after school, Mahina walked Pyrimis and her cousin Helia home, chatting lightly but keeping a wary eye out for trouble. \\"I'm so sorry you both got caught up with those Team Skull thugs yesterday,\\" Mahina said, shaking her head. \\"They're wanna-be gangsters who have been causing some trouble around Alola lately.\\" Pyrimis nodded gravely. \\"We really appreciate you stepping in when you did, Mahina. Right, Helia?\\" The shy blonde girl clinging to Mahina's side managed a small smile. \\"Y-Yes... Thank you for saving me again...\\" Mahina waved off their praise. \\"Of course! We have to stand up to bullies like that. My mom is actually working with the Island Kahunas to rein in these misfits.\\" Her face took on a serious expression quite foreign for the normally cheery girl. \\"Still, Pyrimis - be very careful going home alone. Team Skull is bold and looking to make trouble.\\" Mahina pulled a slip of paper from her backpack and pressed it into her friend's hand. \\"Take my number, okay? Call if you ever feel threatened or unsafe.\\" Pyrimis nodded, tucking the precious contact safely away. \\"I will, Mahina. And thank you again for everything.\\" The two cousins turned down a side road, waving goodbye. Pyrimis continued on the main path towards her house. The island breeze was fragrant with flowering bushes. Wingull cried brightly overhead. It was hard to imagine danger lurking in this island paradise. Then Pyrimis heard a rustling behind her. She turned to see three all-too familiar boys blocking the way back - the bullies from the previous day. Pyrimis backed away slowly only to find two more punks emerging from around a building. They had planned this ambush. \\"Thought you got off easy yesterday, huh?\\" their leader leered, Pokéball in hand. \\"We don't forget. Those who crosses Team Skull pays hard!\\" The delinquents sent forth a barrage of Zubat, Drowzee and Yungoos with snarls of \\"Get her!\\" Frightened, Pyrimis stumbled backwards. In her panic she fumbled for her phone to call Mahina but a Yungoos swatted the device from her trembling hands. Pyrimis cowered helplessly as the creatures and boys closed in. Just then a sharp voice cut through the chaos - \\"That's enough!\\" All heads whipped towards the alley mouth where Guanis stood, eyes flashing. With fluid grace the silver-haired girl glided forward, ignoring the gang's angry threats. Her hand rose, emitting an eerie glow. When the light faded, a ferocious Hydreigon loomed with jaws splayed wide. The color drained from the bullies' faces at the sight of the formidable dragon Pokémon. But their boss stubbornly roared \\"Take them down!\\" launching his squad back on the offensive. Yet Guanis and her partner were a forced to be reckoned with. They moved in seamless tandem as Hydreigon felled opponents left and right with pulses of draconic energy. Within minutes, the incompetent Pokémon lay battered on the pavement. Their appalled Trainers rushed to return them safely to their containers. Undeterred by his fallen squad, the hotheaded leader pulled out a baseball bat. With a guttural yell he charged straight for the slight silver-haired girl wildly swinging. But with blinding speed Guanis grabbed his beefy arm and hurled the bully over her shoulder to crash meters away, stunning onlookers. This only further enraged the gang members. They mobbed towards Guanis flailing vengefully. Yet her fluid combat skills coupled with Hydreigon finishing weakened enemies made short work of the brawl. When the dust cleared, a pile of groaning punks littered the ground as Guanis calmly returned her stoic Pokémon. Jaws agape, Pyrimis tried processing what unbelievable power this mysterious girl wielded. With silent grace, Guanis drifted over to Pyrimis extending a slender hand now enveloped in that strange glow again. Transfixed by those arresting violet eyes, Pyrimis neither moved nor breathed. What was happening? What did Guanis want? \\"There you are!\\" Both girls jolted as Mahina came barrelling onto the scene, alerted by bystanders. \\"Pyrimis! Oh thank goodness you're alright!\\" she panted in relief before blinking at the carnage around them. \\"What...what happened here?\\" In that distracted instant, the radiance around Guanis's palm vanished. Features unreadable, she withdrew wordlessly into the alley's shadows and was gone between one blink and the next. Still shaking from her trauma, Pyrimis desperately hugged her friend. \\"Th-they came after me... But Guanis saved me somehow...\\" She gestured helplessly at the battered bullies. Mahina guided the shocked girl gently away from the aftermath, one protective arm around her shoulders. She cast a puzzled glance back at where Guanis disappeared. There was surely more here than met the eye. \\"Let's get you safely home for now,\\" Mahina murmured. \\"We can figure things out later.\\" Pyrimis only nodded numbly, feelings swirling chaotically inside. Yet those mesmerizing violet eyes now blazed brightly in Pyrimis's mind. Guanis was no helpless waif - that much was clear. Beneath her fragile appearance lay immense power and danger. Had she meant to unleash that energy on Pyrimis just now? Or did she want to share her secrets at last after the life-saving heroics? Either way, Pyrimis knew with utmost certainty that crossing paths again with cryptic, captivating Guanis was inevitable. Whether it brought answers or peril, their fates were surely intertwined now. Chapter 5 The next morning, Pyrimis felt a nervous flutter in her stomach as she approached Melemele Island Pokémon academy once more, the traumatic encounter with Team Skull still fresh in her mind. However, Mahina waved eagerly from the entrance, exuding a sense of cheerfulness and protection that helped put Pyrimis at ease. \\"Alola again, friend!\\" Mahina greeted her warmly as she entered the campus grounds. \\"I hope you're holding up okay after yesterday's terrible ordeal.\\" Pyrimis managed a soft smile. \\"Yes, I'm still a bit shaken up but nothing too serious thanks to you...and Guanis,\\" she said slowly, peering over Mahina's shoulder into the classroom. Sure enough, there perched the silver-haired enigma in the same spot quietly reading amidst the morning bustle. \\"Well I'm so glad you arrived safely. You're always welcome walking home with me and Helia if it makes you feel safer,\\" Mahina said, giving Pyrimis's hand a gentle squeeze. \\"Now if you'll excuse me, I need to drop off a book at the library before class.\\" Glancing back at the reading girl once more as Mahina rushed off, Pyrimis steeled her nerves and approached her rescuer's desk with cautious steps. \\"Good morning, Guanis...I wanted to properly thank you for yesterday. You really saved me from those Team Skull punks.\\" Guanis raised her striking violet eyes up from the book, quiet for an uncomfortable moment as she took in Pyrimis's anxious form. \\"It was nothing. I merely happened to walk by as they accosted you,\\" she said curtly before returning to her pages. The brush-off didn't deter Pyrimis though. \\"Even so, I'm endlessly grateful for your intervention,\\" she pressed on earnestly. \\"Not every person would take on a dangerous gang like that to protect a stranger.\\" At this, Guanis met her gaze steadily again as if evaluating Pyrimis's genuineness. \\"I'm not scared easily,\\" Guanis said simply. \\"Those criminals were clearly in the wrong threatening others more vulnerable than themselves just to inflate their own egos.\\" Her lip curled slightly with distaste. Her composure and fearlessness was admirable to Pyrimis. \\"Still, I hope I can repay you in some way for your great kindness...\\" The faintest ghost of a smirk played on Guanis's lips but she didn't respond, glancing casually out the classroom window. Her attention seemed divided. Following Guanis's eyeline, Pyrimis noticed a green-haired girl seated across the room watching them both unabashedly. There was interest and perhaps a hint of challenge in the stranger's gaze that raised Pyrimis's suspicions. \\"Do you...know that person?\\" Pyrimis asked Guanis hesitantly, nodding towards the observer. But she had already lost Guanis's interest, who rose smoothly from her seat while shutting her book with a snap. \\"I wouldn't concern yourself with idle curiosities,\\" Guanis deflected vaguely. \\"Just take care on your way home today.\\" She swept soundlessly towards the exit, conversation evidently over. Pyrimis watched her go, feeling awkward at the abrupt end to her well-intentioned chat. At the same moment, Pyrimis saw the green-haired onlooker smirk and glide swiftly out another doorway, threads of what seemed like smoke trailing behind her. Alone in the chaotic classroom now, Pyrimis sank slowly into her assigned seat. Her palms felt oddly clammy after that strange encounter as she puzzled over Guanis's brush-off attitude coupled with her attention clearly divided elsewhere. What was truly going on between Guanis and that mysterious girl? Why did Pyrimis sense obscure psychic energies flickering around the peripheries of their terse interaction just now? One thing was clear - there were hidden secrets woven around Guanis's presence that Pyrimis burned to uncover. She had more questions now than ever after finally speaking directly to the intriguing silver-haired girl. However difficult cracking that shell may prove though, Pyrimis's instincts told her the effort would be worthwhile. Because opening the cipher that was Guanis could lead to revelations beyond Pyrimis's wildest imaginings... Chapter 6 On Saturday, Pyrimis walked out of the academy with Mahina and Helia, the final school bell still echoing faintly behind them. As the trio crossed the yard chatting lightly, a group of boys loafing by the gates caught sight of them and instantly looked uneasy. Pyrimis recognized the juvenile delinquents from Team Skull who had previously harassed both her and poor Helia. The scraggly-haired punks shuffled amongst themselves nervously, eyes darting between the approaching girls and the exit as if weighing options. Before any decision was reached, one of them yelped \\"It's that witch Pyrimis again!\\" This outburst spurred his whole scruffy posse into action. Scrambling over themselves frantically, the boys made a mad dash in the opposite direction with panicked speed as if a starving Hydreigon itself was on their heels. Mahina burst out laughing loudly at their entertaining display. \\"Ha! Look how scared they are of you now, Pyrimis! I think Guanis left a strong impression saving your hide. They probably think you've put some curse on them too!\\" Helia giggled sweetly as well, edging a bit closer to Pyrimis as though she felt safest by the side of her courageous protector. \\"S-serves those bullies right! They should know better than to be mean now.\\" The young girl's tone carried a surprising hint of hardness underneath the high softness. Pyrimis imagined losing one's sense of safe youth far too young thanks to such characters could spur even the gentlest soul to spitefulness. As the trio continued walking and joking casually about the hoodlums' comical cowardice, Pyrimis spotted the cute hillside path leading towards Helia and Mahina's neighborhood drawing closer. Sure enough, her two new cherished companions slowed to a stop at the divergence regretfully. \\"I wish you could just come over and hang out, Pyrimis!\\" Mahina said a touch wistfully. \\"But I know you probably have chores or weekend homework too...\\" As if suddenly remembering something important, Helia began rooting through her backpack hurriedly. \\"Oh yes, I nearly forgot!\\" She withdrew a sealed envelope and handed it to Pyrimis shyly. \\"M-my mom w-wanted me to give this to you...as an extra thank you for, you know, helping me with those bullies before.\\" As the diminutive girl continued studying her shoes intently while a rosy blush colored her fair cheeks, Pyrimis felt a nearly overwhelming surge of tenderness. Had there ever been a sweeter child who so naturally brought out people's most protective impulses? \\"It was my true honor protecting you, dear Helia.\\" Pyrimis gave her shoulder a gentle squeeze. \\"But I will happily pass your mother's regards onto Grandpa as well when I'm home. He'll surely be pleased you're doing better now.\\" With a final fierce hug and cheery goodbye calls, the cousins eventually disappeared down their village path, faces still bright with laughter's lingering glow. Trudging up the steps to her own quiet house, Pyrimis slid inside with the lonely click of an automatic lock sounding loud as a gunshot in the empty space. Weariness finally overtaking earlier adrenaline, Pyrimis carelessly dropped her overloaded backpack on the sitting room floor before sinking onto the sofa herself with boneless sprawl. At this hour on a Saturday, she expected no other presence or sounds besides her own isolated heartbeat. Grandfather was undoubtedly consumed with administrative affairs at Aether Foundation headquarters as ever on weekends. She was long resigned to solitary stillness permeating their shared but seldom intersecting orbits bounded by this hollow home. Closing grainy eyes against the invasive sunlight, Pyrimis attempted processing the mental whiplash between school days overflowing with new fascinating personalities and stimuli...before harshly crashing each afternoon into the cold vacuum of this barren abode once more. Loneliness had been her sole childhood playmate for so long. But now with tantalizing invitations to friendship and camaraderie actually extended sincerely, their inevitable withdrawals each evening left Pyrimis raw as a festering wound suddenly exposed. Was it wise opening her vulnerable heart this way only to ensure repeated abandonments slicing deeper affectively over time? Could such attachments thrive rooted in another's passing charity rather than true belonging? Shaking loose the descending spiral of melancholy, Pyrimis sat up with sharp determination and grasped Helia's delivered envelope. Slitting it open smoothly revealed a tri-folded letter penned in sloping graceful script. The golden-haired Professor Lillie expressed profuse gratitude towards Pyrimis alongside an open delight at their daughters' blossoming bond seeded from that traumatic incident. \\"As ever, if there is anything at all I can offer towards your academic journey or adventures, please only ask!\\" The effusive words glowed up from the creamy sheet. \\"In fact...\\" Here Pyrimis noticed a postcard depicting an imposing multi-winged modernist building tucked among the folds. Flipping it over, her roving gaze locked upon the flowing handwriting once more with a fluttering spark reigniting somewhere deep in her chest - \\"Please come to the Pokémon Institute on Sunday this week if you have free time. I would be overjoyed to provide a personal tour where we can chat more! You are always welcome.\\" It closed affectionately with Lillie's signature. Pyrimis slowly lowered the engraved invitation as her pulse inexplicably began quickening in tandem with prescient thoughts swirling dizzyingly... What long-buried truths might this exclusive glimpse behind normally barred gates connect her to at last? What clandestineResearch or shadowy underground forces converged unseen around her and this place? What mysteries nearer the surface might finally yield their secrets as well? Clenching the pass tightly with galvanized purpose, Pyrimis swept off towards her room. This singular opportunity shimmered like a hidden key promising to unlock doors long frustratingly sealed. The time had come at last to see what revelations lay waiting once someone turned the lock... Chapter 7 Sunday morning rose bright and balmy as Pyrimis readied herself for the excursion to Alola’s famous Pokémon Institute. She had heard captivating rumors of the revolutionary research and conservation efforts ongoing behind those slick steel walls. This exclusive invitation seemed an unmissable chance to glimpse those secrets possibly tied to the cosmic mysteries swirling around Pyrimis lately. Smoothly navigating the island buses, Pyrimis soon arrived at the impressive facility gleaming sharp and modern against Akala Island’s lush forests. Young Helia smiled and waved eagerly near the threshold. \\"Hi Pyrimis! I’m s-so excited you c-came!\\" Helia greeted a touch breathlessly. \\"M-my mom can’t wait to meet you either! Sh-she’s just inside her office.\\" Helia led Pyrimis through the sliding automatic doors into a sleek lobby suffused with midday radiance from the graceful skylights overhead. Pausing before an imposing door labeled \\"Director Lillie\\" in polished letters, Helia tapped gently. A melodious voice inside responded warmly - \\"Come in!\\" Striding over the threshold, Pyrimis quickly assessed the spacious corner office hosting an elegant desk of rich mahogany. There stood the same woman from the heartfelt letter - tall and willowy with cascading golden hair. Kind green eyes crinkled behind stylish glasses as Lillie extended a hand in greeting. \\"Welcome dear Pyrimis! What an honor and delight to finally meet you. I’m Lillie, founding member here and director of research at the Institute. Thank you endlessly for accepting my invitation today!\\" \\"The honor is mine, Direct...I mean, Lillie,\\" Pyrimis caught herself bashfully, shaking Lillie's smooth palm. \\"Your facilities look so incredible. I can hardly wait for a tour!\\" Lillie smiled graciously. \\"It would be my pleasure! Right this way now...\\" The next hours flew by enthralled as Lillie guided Pyrimis through the assortment of advanced labs. Researchers demonstrated revolutionary technologies harnessing the resonant heartbeats of Alola's guardian deities. One restricted chamber even hosted drifting Ultra Beasts suspended in a massive preservation tank. Pyrimis's sharp mind spun nearly overwhelmed processing such exhibitions of bleeding-edge innovations. At last Lillie led them down a final hallway towards an unmarked door. \\"I saved our most special project for last!\\" she declared, ushering Pyrimis and Helia inside the undisclosed room. At its center stood an odd device resembling an egg incubator built for three sizable Pokéballs. Lillie tapped the attached keypad expertly and the balls simultaneously burst open with bursts of light energy. Before Pyrimis's dazzled eyes materialized three small Pokémon - an owl-like Rowlet, a furry Litten kitten, and a cute amphibious Popplio. The creatures chirped and blinked up curiously at the unfamiliar humans. \\"Since you just arrived in Alola, I thought you deserved the traditional privilege of selecting a partner Pokémon to be your steadfast friend and battling companion!\\" Lillie announced proudly. Helia clapped excitedly as Pyrimis hesitantly approached the awaiting trio. Rowlet hooted softly, wise round eyes studying her. Litten maintained aloof composure carefully grooming its striped fur. But the round-nosed Popplio began bouncing over eagerly, nuzzling against Pyrimis's leg with affectionate affection. Bending down slowly, she ran gentle fingers over the sea lion cub's smooth head and down its back as it leaned happily into her touch making a sweet trilling noise that seemed to resonate within Pyrimis's heart strings. Mind made up solidly, Pyrimis lifted her bright gaze towards Lillie’s approving one. \\"I believe Popplio and I will be perfect partners for this new chapter in my Alola story.” As she said this, Popplio yipped excitedly, flipping backwards in a little circle before butting its head back against Pyrimis’ palm demandingly. Lillie beamed, handing Pyrimis a standard Pokéball bearing a water insignia. \\"I think Popplio agrees wholeheartedly! This is a momentous event.\\" After Pyrimis tapped the ball lightly capturing her new dear friend in a beam of red energy, Lillie guided them from the lab entreating her guests to stop by anytime. Strolling outside shoulder to shoulder with diminutive Helia into the sunshine, Pyrimis felt her new companion's Pokéball rocking gently at her waistband matching the lightness rising in her own heart. What an unbelievable day of wonders! Who knew what amazing adventures lay over the horizon now with her own Pokémon at her side henceforth come what may... Chapter 8 Pyrimis bounced on her school shoes, barely able to contain her excitement as she waited outside the school for Mahina's arrival. Clutched tightly in her hand was the Pokéball containing her new friend - Popplio. She had spent all of Sunday evening bonding with the affectionate water Pokémon and could hardly wait to show Mahina. Soon enough, the cheery girl came bounding up the path towards Pyrimis. \\"Alola! Ready for another week?\\" Mahina greeted brightly before noticing her friend's eager expression. \\"Hey, what's got you looking so thrilled this early?\\" In response, Pyrimis triumphantly held out Popplio's Pokéball. \\"Ta-da! Remember Professor Lillie invited me to the research institute yesterday? Well she gifted me this Popplio as my starter Pokémon! Meet my new partner.\\" With a flash, the cute sea lion cub materialized before them with a happy bark. Mahina's eyes went wide. \\"Amazing!! Your very own Pokémon now!\\" She dropped to her knees, petting Popplio's slick fur as it trilled affectionately. \\"Oh I just adore Popplio - you two are perfect for each other! We need to commemorate your first steps as a real trainer.\\" Pyrimis beamed down proudly at her new companion. \\"I agree completely. I want to dive right into learning about Pokémon battles and contest strategies. Do you know anyone who could give a novice some guidance?\\" Mahina's thoughtful expression morphed into an eager grin. \\"As a matter of fact, I know just the place! C'mon, follow me.\\" Scooping up an excited Popplio into her arms, Pyrimis hurried after Mahina's lead towards a small annex building. Pushing open the doors, her eyes grew wide taking in the spacious hall packed with chatting students and scampering Pokémon. It had a strangely professional and bureaucratic air compared to Pyrimis's expectations. Various booths and desks lined the walls manned by older kids in crisp uniforms. \\"Welcome to headquarters for the Melemele Student Council and its Pokémon Activities Coordination branch!\\" Mahina declared with a grand sweep of her hand. \\"This is where young trainers hang out and organize stuff like battling tournaments, contest training, and field research trips.\\" Just then, a Pikachu came bounding through the bustling crowds towards them. It paused before Pyrimis, releasing a series of squeaks and gestures while energetically miming a battle stance. \\"Aww, looks like he wants to meet your new trainee Pokémon, Pyrimis!\\" Mahina translated affectionately. The electric mouse continued its charade a few moments more before scampering off, clearly beckoning them to follow. Exchanging curious glances with Popplio, Pyrimis hurried along in the yellow Pokémon's zig-zagging wake. They weaved through scattered lounge chairs and makeshift battle arenas until Pikachu finally skidded to a halt before a simple desk on the far side. Hopping atop the wooden surface directly facing them, the little creature allowed Pyrimis a clear view of the girl seated there for the first time. Recognition sparked instantly - it was the same green-haired observer from their odd classroom encounter days before! \\"Why Shmaya, I see you've brought some new friends by today!\\" Mahina exclaimed brightly to the older girl. Turning to Pyrimis she added \\"This is Shmaya, president of the whole student council. She's crazy smart and super nice!\\" Shmaya smiled warmly, absently petting her Pikachu who had nestled on her shoulders. \\"A pleasure meeting you officially, Pyrimis. And congratulations on beginning your Pokémon journey with such a wonderful companion.\\" She nodded graciously towards Popplio who barked his own polite greeting. Unsure what to make of this surprise familiar face in an unexpected role, Pyrimis managed a shy half-bow. \\"Thank you so much. I-I'm still very new to training of course but hoping to learn.\\" \\"As are we all, no matter our experience level with beloved partners.\\" Shmaya replied earnestly. \\"Growth is a never-ending process if one keeps an open and curious mind.\\" She studied Pyrimis a long thoughtful moment before continuing gently. \\"In fact, I must apologize if my observation the other day felt intrusive. As a council leader I make it my duty to know all members of our school community, especially those who...stand apart.\\" At this, Shmaya flicked her gaze subtly across the hall. Following it, Pyrimis noticed the other students automatically shifting away from a slim silver-haired figure who had just entered the room - Guanis. The mysterious girl moved through the space with her usual unearthly composure, students actively avoiding proximity as if by magnetic repulsion. Yet Guanis appeared fully accustomed to the isolation, not even lifting her eyes from the book cradled in one arm as she passed noiselessly towards a far corner chair. Frowning slightly, Pyrimis turned back towards Shmaya. \\"Why does everyone seem scared of Guanis? She saved my life from those bullies before.\\" Shmaya tilted her head contemplatively. \\"I understand she has quite a...reputation around here as rather eccentric and unapproachable despite standout talents. Some even consider Guanis dangerously antisocial. Honestly she remains an enigma to me as well.\\" Reading genuine empathy rather than judgment in Shmaya's eyes, Pyrimis felt emboldened to press further. \\"Well maybe if more people tried including Guanis respectfully instead of shunning her outright, that perception would change for the better over time.\\" A hint of wistfulness tinged Shmaya's smile. \\"I wholeheartedly agree. Perhaps your openness presents a fine model towards that goal...\\" Trailing off, the Student President began rummaging through her desk drawer before extracting a small silver pin engraved with a Pokéball symbol. \\"In fact Pyrimis, I would be delighted to officially invite you as the newest member of the Pokémon Activities Coordination division. Here is your membership badge - may it mark just the first step in your promising journey of growth ahead.\\" Bowing gratefully, Pyrimis fastened the shiny marker of acceptance proudly beside her own normal school pin. After a few more minutes of animated discussion about battle tactics, the first bell chimed faintly. \\"Best get to our classroom soon. Please stop by anytime though - I would enjoy hearing about your Pokémon adventures going forward!\\" Shmaya said warmly as she gathered up papers into her satchel. In the distance, Pyrimis spotted Guanis's slight form slipping soundlessly out the hall's side exit into shadowy freedom once more. \\"I will, thank you so much for everything today!\\" Pyrimis replied to Shmaya before turning towards Mahina who had been happily playing with Pyrimis's Popplio the whole time. Scooping up her tired water Pokémon, Pyrimis waved a final goodbye to Shmaya and her Pikachu, mind already racing towards ideas for properly training her very first battling companion. Please continue the above story to generate Chapter 9 of the novel.","completion":"Chapter 9 Walking back to the classroom, Pyrimis felt a newfound sense of purpose with the student council badge glinting on her uniform. Mahina chattered excitedly about upcoming school events and the competitions they could now enter together. \\"I can't wait to see Popplio in action,\\" Mahina exclaimed, her eyes sparkling with enthusiasm. \\"And I know just the perfect person to help with your training!\\" She pulled out her phone and began typing a message. \\"Who might that be?\\" Pyrimis asked, curiously watching Mahina's nimble fingers fly across the screen. \\"A good friend of mine, Hau. He's Hala's grandson – you know, the Island Kahuna of Melemele. Hau's a fantastic Pokémon trainer and I'm sure he'd be thrilled to give us some pointers!\\" Mahina tapped send and slid her phone back into her pocket. As the pair entered the classroom, Pyrimis's Pokéball twitched at her side. She glanced down to see Popplio's ball vibrating with anticipation. With a soft chuckle, she released the little Pokémon, who immediately perked up at the sight of other students and their Pokémon milling around. The bell rang, signaling the start of the day's lessons. Pyrimis and Popplio took their usual seats as Mahina joined them. They turned their attention to the front, where the teacher introduced the day's topic – Pokémon types and advantages. The lesson flew by in a blur of excited whispers and eager note-taking. As class ended, Mahina's phone beeped with a new message. \\"He's in! Hau's going to meet us at the Battle Dome after school,\\" she said with a triumphant smile. \\"We should pack our bags now so we can head straight there!\\" Hearing this news, Pyrimis couldn't focus on her remaining classes. Thoughts of strategies and potential moves danced through her head, intertwining with anticipation about meeting this Hau and what wisdom he might impart. Finally, the last bell tolled, freeing the students from their educational responsibilities for the day. With Mahina leading the charge, the two girls and Popplio made their way eagerly to the Battle Dome. When they arrived, Pyrimis spotted a boy around her age practicing with his Incineroar. He moved with confidence, directing the fiery feline Pokémon through a series of complex maneuvers. At the sight of Mahina and Pyrimis, he broke into a wide grin and jogged over to greet them. \\"Mahina! Who's your friend?\\" Hau's voice was warm and welcoming, much like Mahina's. \\"This is Pyrimis,\\" Mahina introduced. \\"She's new to Alola and eager to learn.\\" \\"Nice to meet you, Pyrimis. I've heard great things already,\\" Hau said, offering a handshake that Pyrimis took gladly. \\"Looks like you have a Popplio there! They're great Pokémon with a lot of potential. Ready for some hands-on training?\\" Popplio barked affirmatively, and Pyrimis couldn't help but share her Pokémon's enthusiasm. \\"Yes, I'm ready. I want to become stronger, for Popplio and for myself.\\" \\"For starters, let's have a friendly match,\\" Hau suggested, a twinkle in his eye. \\"Nothing serious, just to see where you're at and what we can work on.\\" Stepping into the arena, Pyrimis squared off against Hau as Mahina took a seat in the stands with several other students, all eager to watch the impromptu battle. \\"Popplio, Water Gun, let's go!\\" Pyrimis called out, initiating her first official Pokémon battle. Hau's Incineroar deftly evaded, retaliating with a Flame Charge. Pyrimis directed Popplio to dodge and counterattack. The battle was a whirlwind of commands and agile maneuvers. Although more experienced, Hau held back, analyzing Pyrimis's strategy and giving pointers where he could. Finally, as Popplio landed a direct hit with Bubble Beam, Hau called off the match with a smile. \\"You've got great instincts, Pyrimis. And Popplio's responsive – a clear sign of a strong bond. But there's always room to improve teamwork and technique.\\" Pyrimis thanked him, her heart swelling with newfound determination. \\"I'm eager to learn. Thank you for the opportunity, Hau.\\" The sun began its descent as they left the Battle Dome, signaling the end of a productive day. With Mahina's high spirits leading them out, Pyrimis felt a sense of belonging she hadn’t felt since she arrived in Alola. Walking home in the softening light, Pyrimis held Popplio's Pokéball, a sense of achievement lifting her steps. With friends like Mahina and Helia, the guidance of Shmaya and Hau, and the unbreakable bond forming with Popplio, she was on the path to discovering what it truly meant to be a Pokémon Trainer. And in the depths of her heart, she knew that sooner or later, her journey would cross paths again with the mystifying Guanis, towards a convergence where fates would intertwine in ways she couldn't yet fathom."},{"prompt":"есть множество мониторинговых интерактивных прогнозов погоды на день, два, неделю как удается метео предсказывать движение холодного и теплого воздуха объясни очень подробно и очень понятно как за счет рекордного тепла в одной точке удается предсказать ураганы или штормы","completion":"Прогнозирование погоды – это сложный процесс, который основан на научных принципах физики атмосферы и использует данные с метеорологических станций, спутников, радаров и других источников. Погодные условия определяются различными факторами, включая температуру, влажность, атмосферное давление, ветер и прочие. Чтобы понять, как удаётся предсказывать движение холодного и теплого воздуха, рассмотрим ключевые шаги процесса прогнозирования: 1. **Сбор данных**: Прежде всего, метеорологи собирают текущие данные о погоде со всего мира. Это включает в себя температуру, давление, скорость и направление ветра, уровень осадков, влажность и другую информацию о состоянии атмосферы. 2. **Моделирование атмосферы**: С помощью компьютерных моделей и алгоритмов, которые учитывают законы физики и динамику атмосферы, эти данные анализируются для создания модели поведения атмосферы на ближайшее время. Эти модели показывают, как взаимодействуют массы холодного и теплого воздуха и какие метеорологические явления могут возникнуть. 3. **Фронты и массы воздуха**: Там, где холодный и теплый воздух сталкиваются, формируются погодные фронты. Теплый воздух, как правило, поднимается над холодным, создавая области с облаками и осадками. Перемещение и взаимодействие этих масс воздуха могут вызвать изменения в прогнозах погоды. 4. **Анализ текущих трендов и аномалий**: В случаях аномально теплых температур, метеорологи анализируют, как эти изменения влияют на циркуляцию атмосферы. Рекордное тепло может привести к усилению локальных ветров, изменению путей циркуляции атмосферы и, как следствие, к формированию экстремальных погодных условий, таких как ураганы и штормы. 5. **Ураганы и штормы**: Теплый воздух над поверхностью океана способствует испарению воды и созданию большой массы влажного воздуха. Когда этот влажный воздух начинает подниматься, он охлаждается и конденсируется, формируя облака и осадки. Энергия, выделяющаяся при конденсации, усиливает ветер и может привести к образованию ураганов, если в данном регионе присутствуют условия, подходящие для их развития – достаточно теплая вода, влажный воздух, отсутствие сдерживающих факторов, таких как вертикальный ветровой сдвиг. 6. **Выдача прогноза**: На основе всех этих данных и анализа моделей метеорологи делают выводы о том, как погода изменится в ближайшие дни или недели и выдают прогнозы погоды. Прогнозы погоды не всегда бывают точными, так как атмосфера весьма сложна и многие процессы в ней носит хаотический характер. Однако современные технологии и методы анализа позволяют делать их всё более и более точными."},{"prompt":"как образуется шторм от самого начала до конца простым языком!","completion":"Хорошо, давайте постараемся объяснить это очень простым языком. Представьте океан или большое море, над которым светит солнце. Когда солнце греет поверхность воды, вода начинает испаряться и поднимается вверх в виде водяного пара. Теплый влажный воздух, который поднимается вверх, легче холодного воздуха. Когда этот теплый воздух поднимается, он сталкивается с более холодным воздухом на высоте. Там теплый воздух охлаждается, и вся эта влага, которую он нес с собой, начинает конденсироваться, превращаясь в мелкие капельки воды или лед — это и образует облака. Теперь, когда вся эта вода конденсируется и образуются облака, это выделяет дополнительную энергию, которая заставляет ветер усиливаться. Чем больше воды конденсируется, тем больше энергии выделяется и тем мощнее становятся ветры вокруг поднимающегося воздуха. Если условия подходящие, например, есть достаточно влажного воздуха и теплой воды, и нет сдерживающих факторов, таких как сильные ветры на больших высотах, которые могли бы \\"размазать\\" эти образующиеся облака, то этот поднимающийся воздух будет продолжать подниматься, формируя всё более крупные и плотные облака. По мере того как облака растут и становятся тяжелее, начинают выпадать осадки — дождь, иногда сопровождаемый грозами. Все эти процессы усиливают ветры у поверхности океана или земли, и может начаться шторм. В случае очень сильного шторма, если воздух продолжает интенсивно подниматься, а ветры вращаются вокруг низкого давления в центре, может образоваться ураган (или тропический циклон). По мере того как шторм перемещается или условия меняются (например, шторм выходит на берег или наталкивается на более холодные воды), он постепенно ослабевает. Энергия теряется, ветры уменьшаются, осадки становятся менее интенсивными, и система постепенно разрушается до тех пор, пока не стихнет."},{"prompt":"log(200000) / log(2) = ?","completion":"The expression you've written can be simplified using the change of base formula, which states that for any positive numbers ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ), where ( a neq 1 ) and ( b > 0 ), the logarithm of ( b ) with base ( a ) can be expressed as: [ log_a(b) = frac{log_c(b)}{log_c(a)} ] Using this, the expression ( log(200000) / log(2) ) can be seen as the base-2 logarithm of 200,000 because you're dividing the logarithm of 200,000 by the logarithm of 2 (using base 10 by default).

Amongst them was the extraordinary Whammer, renowned for his superhuman strength and his love for creating a ruckus. Most days, he could be found happily causing chaos alongside his villainous comrades, Tobey, Chuck, and The Butcher. One particularly sunny day, the Wordgirl villains decided to take a break from their mischievous schemes and indulge themselves in some downtime. They gathered at their favorite hangout spot, a shady alleyway, and enjoyed a rare moment of peace. Tobey was busy tinkering with his inventions, Chuck was devouring a bag of potato chips, and The Butcher was busy petting his loyal sidekick, the Robo-Goat. However, as they glanced over at Whammer, they noticed something unusual. Whammer stood alone, his normally energetic eyes staring vacantly at nothing in particular. Concerned, Tobey approached him cautiously. \\"Hey, Whammer,\\" he began, \\"are you okay? You seem a bit... off.\\" Whammer sighed deeply and shook his head, his pound-shaped hammer resting limply by his side. \\"I don't know, guys,\\" he admitted, his voice tinged with sadness. \\"Lately, I've been feeling numb. Empty. It's like there's this void inside me, and I don't know how to make it go away.\\" His teammates exchanged glances, their usual mischievous grins replaced by looks of genuine concern. Chuck set aside his bag of chips and sat beside Whammer, placing a comforting hand on his giant shoulder. \\"We're here for you, buddy. You can talk to us,\\" he reassured. Whammer let out another dejected sigh. \\"You see, throughout my villainous career, I've always been a ball of pure happiness. Smashing things, causing mayhem, it all made me so incredibly joyous. But now... now it feels wrong. I shouldn't be feeling like this.\\" The Butcher, gruff but caring, joined the conversation, his eyes filled with empathy. \\"Whammer, there's no shame in feeling down sometimes. Even villains can have their moments of uncertainty and sadness.\\" Tobey nodded in agreement. \\"Exactly! We all go through difficult times, and the important thing is to support each other. You're not alone in this, Whammer.\\" Whammer's downcast eyes finally met his teammates'. \\"Thank you, guys. I appreciate your support more than you know. It's just hard to accept that I can feel anything other than happiness.\\" Chuck grinned mischievously, trying to lighten the mood. \\"You know, Whammer, even villains deserve a break from being perfectly happy all the time. Don't worry, once you find what brings you joy again, you'll bounce back stronger than ever.\\" Whammer managed a faint smile, comforted by his teammates' understanding. \\"You guys are right. Maybe I just need to figure out what truly makes my hammer pound with excitement again.\\" Encouraged by the support of his comrades, Whammer decided to embark on a personal journey of self-discovery. Together, the Wordgirl villains faced countless challenges, but through it all, their bond grew stronger. They realized that true strength lied not only in destructive power but also in the unity and compassion they found within their team. And so, the Wordgirl villains continued to challenge their heroic nemesis, knowing that whatever difficulties came their way, they had each other to count on.

Despite their efforts, Whammer's cheerlessness persisted, weighing heavily on both him and his concerned comrades. As they entered the dimly lit warehouse, Whammer's face crumbled, and a single tear escaped his eye. The other villains turned their attention to him, noticing the tear as it trickled down his cheek. Alarmed, their immediate reaction was to surround their companion, offering words of comfort and support. Tobey stepped forward and gently placed a hand on Whammer's broad shoulder. His voice filled with genuine compassion. \\"Whammer, my friend, you don't have to blame yourself for feeling this way. No one expects you to be instantly 'fixed' just because we took you out to have fun.\\" Chuck nodded, understanding etched across his face. \\"Absolutely, Whammer. Your feelings aren't your fault.

The warmth of their support washed over him, soothing his troubled heart. They offered words of encouragement, reminding him that vulnerability was not a weakness, but a testament to their friendship. In that moment, surrounded by compassion and understanding, Whammer realized that his feelings were valid, and he wasn't alone in his struggle. He didn't need to put up a façade of unwavering happiness for his friends; he could be his true self, even when that self was hurting. Days turned into weeks, and the Wordgirl villains continued their adventures, fighting their battles as a united front. Along the way, Whammer discovered that opening up to his teammates, sharing his darker moments, and accepting their unwavering support was an essential part of healing. Whammer's journey toward rediscovering joy was not an overnight transformation, but with his teammates by his side, he began to gradually find solace and genuine happiness again. The Wordgirl villains understood that healing was a process, and they willingly stood beside Whammer every step of the way. Their bond, forged through both triumphs and struggles, grew stronger than ever. And through it all, they learned an important lesson—together, they could weather any storm, supporting one another in times of need and celebrating in times of joy."},{"prompt":"A few cheerless days later, Whammer sits on the warehouse couch, his eyes downcast, when he decides to see if training at the old scrapyard will cheer him up.

Eager to find solace and maybe rediscover a sense of purpose, he stood up, brush the dust off his clothes, and headed towards the scrapyard. As Whammer entered the scrapyard, the familiar sight of mangled metal and twisted wreckage surrounded him. He took a deep breath, finding comfort in the scent of rust and debris. Standing in the center of the vast space, he swung his trusty hammer. But then, in a moment of unfortunate clumsiness, Whammer lost his grip, sending his hammer crashing into a nearby car. The impact was unexpected, sending out a vibrant wave of blue energy that rippled through the air. Whammer stared in bewilderment as the car was hurled across the scrapyard, propelled by an unseen force. His eyes widened, his heart raced, and a surge of exhilaration coursed through his veins. Curiosity piqued, Whammer clenched his fists together and punched the air. Blue kinetic energy spiraled from his hands, releasing energetic blasts that shot through the air with stunning force.

In the bustling city of Fair City, where heroes and villains often clashed, a group of notorious villains known as the Coalition of Malice Headquarters or \\"CMH\\" was taking an unusual break from their wicked schemes. The CMH, consisting of various villains like Dr. Two-Brains, Chuck the Evil Sandwich-Making Guy, The Butcher, and of course, Whammer, usually spent their time plotting mischief to defeat the heroic Wordgirl. But on this particular day, as the sun began to set, the CMH members found themselves aimlessly gathered in their secret hideout, bored and without any heinous plot to commit. Suddenly, amidst their boredom, they heard a soft and melancholic sob, echoing through the chambers of the hideout. Intrigued by this unusual sound, the villains curiously followed the sobs, winding their way to a small room at the end of a dimly lit corridor. There, they discovered Whammer, their resident bruiser, sitting on the floor surrounded by broken toys, clutching a worn-out red teddy bear to his chest. Whammer, known for his tough appearance and powerful punches, was rarely seen showing any emotions other than anger or frustration. The sight of him crying over a damaged teddy bear was completely unexpected for his comrades. They exchanged bewildered glances but quickly set aside their surprise, approaching him cautiously. \\"What's going on, Whammer?\\" Dr. Two-Brains asked, his voice filled with genuine concern. Whammer looked up, his eyes red and teary, and held up the old teddy bear. \\"I-I just... I can't fix him. H-He's my only friend, and he's all torn apart.\\" The other villains, seeing Whammer's vulnerability, felt a twinge of empathy. Despite their evil personas, they understood the importance of having someone to share their feelings with. Realizing that they needed to support their distressed friend, a wave of camaraderie washed over them. Chuck, the Evil Sandwich-Making Guy, stepped forward, a toolkit in hand. \\"Hey, Whammer, let's fix him up! We've dealt with more complicated stuff before.\\" The Butcher, surprisingly nimble for someone his size, offered a box filled with colorful patches and buttons. \\"We've got supplies here to make him look better than ever!\\" Dr. Two-Brains, using his sharp intellect, suggested various techniques to stitch and clean the teddy bear. The villains combined their unique skills, working together like an unexpected but surprisingly efficient team. As they carefully maneuvered needles, applied patches, and sewed, their conversations shifted from their usual evil schemes to joyful anecdotes from their childhoods. They talked about the importance of cherished memories and the comfort that a beloved toy could bring to one's heart. Time flew by as they collaborated, and eventually, a transformation took place. The worn-out red teddy bear became vibrant once again. The tears of both Whammer and the teddy bear had been mended, and a smile found its way onto Whammer's face. Whammer gently hugged the teddy bear, its ear now adorned with a shiny patched-up button. \\"Thank you, guys. I never expected you to help me like this.\\" Chuck grinned, sandwich crumbs lingering around his mouth. \\"No problem, Whammer! Friends help each other, ya know?\\" The villains, for once, felt a sense of satisfaction and accomplishment; their hearts warmed by the unexpected connection they had forged through a broken toy. They realized that friendship and empathy could transcend their roles as villains. From that day forward, the CMH found themselves occasionally exchanging evil plans for acts of kindness among themselves. They even held secretive toy maintenance workshops, repairing and gifting forgotten toys to children in need. And so, the infamous villains of Fair City, led by Whammer, not only continued their quest for chaos but also discovered the joy of friendship and the power of caring for others."},{"prompt":"Hola","completion":"¡Hola! ¿En qué puedo ayudarte hoy?"},{"prompt":"Mensaje para enviar en grupo de WhatsApp del salón de clases a las madres de familia para ver si querrán posada navideña","completion":"Puedes estructurar el mensaje de la siguiente manera para que sea claro, educado y amigable: --- Asunto: Propuesta de Posada Navideña para la Clase de [Nombre del profesor/a] ¡Hola, queridas madres y padres de familia!

Examples digits(1) ➞ 0 digits(10) ➞ 9 digits(100) ➞ 189 digits(2020) ➞ 6969 Notes The numbers are going to be rather big so creating that string won't be practical.\\"","completion":"The key observation is that numbers of different lengths contribute different amounts of digits when concatenated. Specifically, numbers with 1 digit (1 through 9) contribute 9 digits in total, numbers with 2 digits (10 through 99) contribute 90 * 2 = 180 digits, and so on. Here's a step-by-step approach: 1. Identify how many digits are there in the number \`n\`. 2. Calculate the total number of digits contributed by numbers less than \`n\` that have fewer digits. 3. Calculate how many numbers there are with the same number of digits as \`n\`, and multiply it by the number of digits to get the contribution from numbers with the same number of digits as \`n\`. Incorporating these steps, here's the corresponding Python function: \`\`\`python def digits(n): # Base case for 0 and 1 if n < 2: return 0 total_digits = 0 num_digits = len(str(n)) # Get the number of digits in n # Sum up the digits contributed by numbers with fewer digits than n for i in range(1, num_digits): total_digits += i * (10 ** i - 10 ** (i - 1)) # Calculate digits for numbers with the same number of digits as n total_digits += num_digits * (n - 10 ** (num_digits - 1)) return total_digits # Test cases print(digits(1)) # ➞ 0 print(digits(10)) # ➞ 9 print(digits(100)) # ➞ 189 print(digits(2020)) # ➞ 6969 \`\`\` Let's break down the main loop. For each power of 10, we calculate the number of digits contributed by all numbers with that many digits: - For numbers with 1 digit (1-9), there are 9 such numbers, contributing \`1 * 9 = 9\` digits. - For numbers with 2 digits (10-99), there are \`90 = 100 - 10\` such numbers, contributing \`2 * 90 = 180\` digits. - For numbers with 3 digits (100-999), there are \`900 = 1000 - 100\` such numbers, contributing \`3 * 900 = 2700\` digits. And so on, until we reach the number of digits in \`n\`. After the loop, we handle the numbers with the same number of digits as \`n\` by adjusting for how many of those numbers actually exist (from \`10 ** (num_digits - 1)\` up to \`n\`), and we multiply by the number of digits of \`n\`.

Create a dictionary mapping each digit on the keypad to its adjacent digits (including the digit itself). 2. For each digit in the given pincode, retrieve its possible variants from the dictionary. 3. Generate all combinations of these variants to form the possible pincodes. 4. Return the list of all possible pincodes.

We use \`itertools.product\` to compute the Cartesian product of possible digits for each position in the original pincode.

We then collect those strings in a list to return the result."},{"prompt":"ERROR: Unable to decode the command from the command line: UnicodeEncodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't encode character 'udce2' in position 366: surrogates not allowed","completion":"The error message you're seeing indicates that there was a problem with encoding a Unicode character using UTF-8. The specific issue here is that the character at position 366 in some text is a Unicode surrogate character. In Unicode, surrogate pairs are used to encode code points outside the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP) in the UTF-16 encoding scheme. However, UTF-8 does not use surrogates, so attempting to encode a surrogate character directly in UTF-8 will result in an error. This error is not related to the Python code provided in the answer to crack pin codes, as there are no non-ASCII or surrogate characters used there. This means that the error is likely coming from a different piece of code or from how the command is being entered in the command line. If you encountered this error while dealing with input or output in Python, there are a couple of things you can check: 1. Ensure that the text you're working with is correctly encoded in UTF-8 and does not contain any surrogate characters. 2. If the error occurs when reading or writing files, make sure to open your files with the correct encoding specified, like so: \`\`\`python with open('filename.txt', 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f: content = f.read() \`\`\` or, when writing to a file: \`\`\`python with open('filename.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as f: f.write(content) \`\`\` 3. If you're processing text received from an external source (like a web API), make sure to handle it properly by decoding it into a Python string before processing. To further assist you with this error, it would be helpful to have more context about when and how the error occurred. If the error is coming from the Python code provided, make sure to only use strings for the keypad and avoid copying and pasting the code from sources that might introduce invalid Unicode characters. If you saw this error message on the command line when trying to run a Python script, please ensure your terminal or the environment you are using is set to use UTF-8 encoding. How to do this might vary depending on the operating system or the command-line interface you are using."},{"prompt":"Build and name the structure of a monoglyceride Two diglycerides (positions 1,2 and 1,3) and two triglycerides (one mixed and one simple) using the following fatty acids. myristic oleic Laurico","completion":"Monoglyceride with myristic acid: Myristic acid is a 14-carbon saturated fatty acid.

продукта, включая тексты, графику, аудио, видео, анимацию, изображения и другие материалы. Контент может быть использован в разных форматах и на разных платформах, от веб-сайтов и блогов до социальных сетей и медиаплатформ. Он является ключевым элементом цифрового маркетинга и обмена информацией через интернет. Копирайтинг – это создание текстового контента, прежде всего с рекламной или маркетинговой целью. Копирайтеры пишут тексты для веб-сайтов, электронных писем, рекламных объявлений, продающих страниц, контента для социальных сетей и других рекламных и маркетинговых материалов с целью привлечения внимания аудитории, разъяснения преимуществ продукта или услуги и убеждения потенциальных клиентов совершить покупку. Использование нейросетей в онлайн-проектах – это внедрение искусственного интеллекта для автоматизации и оптимизации различных аспектов создания контента. Нейросети могут анализировать данные, генерировать тексты, обрабатывать изображения и даже отвечать на вопросы пользователей в режиме реального времени. Примеры использования нейросетей в копирайтинге: 1. Генерирование заголовков: Нейросеть может придумать множество заголовков в соответствии с указанным стилем и рекомендациями заказчика. 2. Структурирование продающих текстов: ИИ может предложить различные структуры для текста, затем создать полноценный продающий текст на основе выбранной структуры. 3. Ответы на возражения: Нейросеть может сформулировать список потенциальных возражений аудитории и подготовить тексты, которые помогут их нивелировать. 4. Создание историй: Искусственный интеллект также способен писать увлекательные и оригинальные истории. Для создания контента с помощью нейросети обычно следуют трем простым шагам: 1. Задание: Задавайте нейросети конкретные запросы, чтобы получить нужный контент. 2. Редактирование: Отредактируйте и адаптируйте полученные шаблоны или тексты под свои требования. 3. Публикация: Разместите готовый контент на блоге, сайте, в социальных сетях или других платформах. Использование нейросетей для создания контента значительно ускоряет процесс работы и позволяет копирайтерам и маркетологам обращаться к большой аудитории с высококачественными и интересными материалами, не тратя при этом много времени на ручной труд и творческие затруднения."},{"prompt":"what does Janie's marriage to Logan represent for Nanny in Their Eyes Were Watching God? select two answers A. intellectual stimulation B. emotional fulfillment C. material advancement D. sheltered security","completion":"The two answers that best represent what Janie's marriage to Logan represents for Nanny in Their Eyes Were Watching God are C. material advancement and D. sheltered security."},{"prompt":"\\" 'ah done lived grandmas way, now Ah means tuh live mine' 'what you mean by dat, Janie?'

In the play, \\"Our Town\\" by Thornton Wilder, minimalistic and suggestive staging is often used. The play relies on the audience's imagination to fill in the details.

La série télévisée \\"Gotham\\" nous offre une vision unique de sa genèse, délaissant le stéréotype du criminel chaotique pour nous présenter un individu façonné par la tragédie et la folie de sa propre ville. Dès le départ, la mentalité du Joker dans \\"Gotham\\" est une toile intrigante de dualités. D'un côté, nous avons un jeune homme vulnérable, victime d'abus et de négligence, qui n’a connu que le mépris et la dérision. De l’autre côté, nous discernons l'émergence d'un esprit retors, une jubilation dans le chaos, et une intelligence stratégique qui manipule les pièces du jeu gothamite avec une précision diabolique. Le Joker incarne la décadence morale et la corruption qui rongent les fondations de Gotham. Il est la manifestation vivante de l’idée que la folie est la seule réponse rationnelle à un monde irrationnel. Sa mentalité n'est pas seulement celle d'un antagoniste s'opposant à l'ordre établi; il est aussi un miroir déformant, reflétant et amplifiant la noirceur au cœur de Gotham. La série nous offre un arc narratif puissant où l'on voit ce personnage évoluer, ou d'une certaine manière, involuer, vers ce que nous connaissons comme étant le Clown Prince du Crime. Il n'est pas seulement le produit de ses expériences personnelles, mais aussi de la société qui l'a créé. Le Joker est à la fois le symbole de la folie et un génie criminel, un homme sans nom qui devient une légende urbaine, redéfinissant la peur et l’absurdité dans les rues obscures de Gotham. En somme, celui que nous appelons le Joker est le résultat finale d’une série d'événements tragiques et une réponse anarchique à l'ordre établi. Il ne cherche pas seulement à déstabiliser, mais aussi à démontrer, avec un sourire terrifiant sur le visage, que tout le monde est à un mauvais jour d’atteindre le bord du précipice sur lequel il règne en maître. Je vous remercie."},{"prompt":"answer this in python methodically:\\"Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

Example 2: Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [3,4] Output: 2.50000 Explanation: merged array = [1,2,3,4] and median is (2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5.

The idea is to find the correct place to partition both arrays to get two equal-sized halves. We make sure that every element in the first half is less than or equal to every element in the second half. Here is the method implemented in Python: \`\`\`python def findMedianSortedArrays(nums1, nums2): # Make sure nums1 is the smaller array if len(nums1) > len(nums2): nums1, nums2 = nums2, nums1 m, n = len(nums1), len(nums2) total = m + n half = total // 2 left, right = 0, m while True: i = (left + right) // 2 # Partition nums1 j = half - i # Partition nums2 # Edge cases where there is no left or right side for the partition nums1_left_max = nums1[i - 1] if i > 0 else float('-infinity') nums1_right_min = nums1[i] if i < m else float('infinity') nums2_left_max = nums2[j - 1] if j > 0 else float('-infinity') nums2_right_min = nums2[j] if j < n else float('infinity') # Check if the partition is correct if nums1_left_max <= nums2_right_min and nums2_left_max <= nums1_right_min: # Check for odd or even total length if total % 2: return min(nums1_right_min, nums2_right_min) else: return (max(nums1_left_max, nums2_left_max) + min(nums1_right_min, nums2_right_min)) / 2 # If not correct, adjust the partition elif nums1_left_max > nums2_right_min: right = i - 1 else: left = i + 1 # Example usage: nums1 = [1, 2] nums2 = [3, 4] print(findMedianSortedArrays(nums1, nums2)) # Output: 2.5 \`\`\` This code performs a binary search on the smaller array, which ensures that we do not exceed the O(log(min(m, n))) time complexity requirement. The while loop will continue until it finds the correct partition. It's crucial to correctly handle the edges of the partitions, which we do by using +/- infinity. This ensures that our partition is valid when i or j is at 0 or m/n. The \`total\` variable is used to handle both odd and even lengths combined from both arrays. If the total length is odd, we simply return the minimum element from the right halves of the partition. If it's even, we take the average of the max element from the left halves and the min element from the right halves."},{"prompt":"write a full cast and crew list if there was an American 1 hr 45 min live-action Asian-American Christmas family comedy film (that takes place in Los Angeles) (the star portrayed by African-American actor Mamoudou Athie, and his girlfroend portrayed by Kelly Marie Tran) (and a bunch of other additional roles), from Universal Pictures and China Film Co., Ltd.

Dans \\"Gotham,\\" ni Jerome ni Jeremiah ne sont appelés le Joker par leur nom, mais leur présence évoque clairement cet esprit chaotique. Tout d'abord, Jerome Valeska se caractérise par sa soif de chaos et son mépris pour l'ordre établi. Sa mentalité est celle d'un provocateur né, cherchant à semer la terreur et la confusion. Sa folie est contagieuse, il inspire à travers lui une onde de chaos dans Gotham. Ensuite, quand Jeremiah apparaît, il apporte une couche supplémentaire à cette folie. Plus calculateur, plus froid, il contraste avec l'approche impulsive de Jerome et représente une menace plus grande et plus méthodique pour la ville. Leurs mentalités, bien que distinctes, ont un trait commun : ils cherchent tous deux à tester les limites de la moralité et à brouiller la ligne entre la justice et la vengeance. Ils sont l'antithèse du héros, prônant un monde sans règles où l'individualisme et l'anarchie prédominent. Pour conclure, la mentalité du Joker dans la série \\"Gotham\\" est une plongée profonde dans les abysses de la psychopathie. Les frères Valeska sont l'incarnation du désordre et du bedlam – des miroirs distordus de la société qui nous forcent à réfléchir sur la nature du mal et du chaos dans un monde ordonné.
