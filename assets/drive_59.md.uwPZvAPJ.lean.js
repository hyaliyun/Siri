Я об этом спрашивал, есть ли частицы, которые можно соединять таким образом, соленоидным?","completion":"Понял. Извините за недоразумение. Если речь идет о соединении частиц при помощи силы, создаваемой магнитным полем, то большинство известных элементарных частиц не обладают зарядом или взаимодействуют с магнитным полем в незначительной степени. Однако некоторые частицы, такие как заряженные лептоны (например, электроны или мюоны), смогут быть в некоторой степени управляемыми в магнитном поле. Это связано с тем, что заряженные частицы испытывают силу Лоренца, действующую на них в магнитном поле. Но важно отметить, что магнитные поля соленоидов обычно не способны создавать достаточно сильные силы для непосредственного соединения частиц. Для детальной манипуляции и соединения частиц требуются более сложные устройства и методы, например, использование электромагнитных ловушек или активных силовых полей."},{"prompt":"Ну а какие из частиц уже были соединены в экспериментах с получением новых частиц?","completion":"В физике элементарных частиц было проведено множество экспериментов, которые привели к образованию и обнаружению новых частиц путем соединения или распада существующих частиц. Вот несколько примеров таких экспериментов и результатов: 1. Большой адронный коллайдер (БАК) в ЦЕРНе: Здесь были обнаружены частицы, такие как бозон Хиггса (Higgs boson), топ-кварк (top quark), а также различные композитные частицы, включая мезоны и барионы. 2. Акселератор Тэватрон в ФНАЛ: Эксперименты на Тэватроне привели к обнаружению топ-кварка и различных бозонов, включая бозоны W и Z. 3. Лептонный коллайдер СЛАСЭ и Ускоритель-коллайдер СЛАСЭ-II: В этих экспериментах были обнаружены кварки чарма, странности и боттома, а также тау-лептоны и тау-антинейтрино. 4. Коллайдер Бэби-М и его усовершенствования: Эти эксперименты привели к открытию новых частиц, включая различные мезоны и барионы. 5. Нейтринный эксперимент СуперКамиоканде: Здесь была обнаружена суперпозиция нейтринного осцилляции и подтверждена массовая разница между разными типами нейтрино. Это только некоторые примеры экспериментов и результатов в области элементарных частиц, и исследования в этой области продолжаются, с целью открытия новых частиц и понимания основных вопросов о природе материи и фундаментальных физических взаимодействиях."},{"prompt":"А с каких частиц уже было создано видимое глазом вещество?","completion":"В нашей обычной видимой материи, которую мы называем веществом, преобладают атомы, состоящие из протонов, нейтронов и электронов. Таким образом, видимая материя создается из этих частиц. Протоны и нейтроны, или ядерные нуклоны, образуют ядро атома, в то время как электроны вращаются вокруг ядра. Именно электроны взаимодействуют с электромагнитным излучением и позволяют нам видеть объекты. Конечно, наша видимая материя также может содержать ионы, которые являются заряженными атомами или молекулами, в которых один или несколько электронов были присоединены или отщеплены, и другие частицы, такие как фотоны (свет) и нейтрино. Однако эти частицы, хотя и взаимодействуют с материей, не играют такой же ключевой роли в формировании видимой материи, как протоны, нейтроны и электроны.

Here's a simple game idea for a Roblox game: Game Title: \\"Obstacle Run\\" Game Description: \\"Obstacle Run\\" is a fast-paced and challenging game where players have to navigate through a series of obstacles and reach the finish line as quickly as possible. The game features multiple levels with increasing difficulty, and players can compete against their friends or other players to achieve the best time. Game Mechanics: 1. Obstacle Courses: Each level consists of a unique obstacle course filled with various challenges such as platforms, moving objects, traps, and more. Players must use their agility and problem-solving skills to overcome each obstacle and advance to the next stage. 2. Power-ups: Along the way, players can collect power-ups scattered throughout the levels. These power-ups can provide temporary abilities like speed boosts, double jumps, or invincibility, helping players overcome particularly difficult sections of the course. 3. Leaderboards and Rankings: The game keeps track of players' completion times for each level. A leaderboard displays the fastest completion times, allowing players to compete against others and strive to set new records. 4. Customization: Players can customize their avatar's appearance with various clothing items, accessories, and skins unlocked or earned through achievements in the game. This adds a personal touch and motivates players to collect and showcase rare or unique rewards. 5. Multiplayer Mode: In addition to single-player mode, \\"Obstacle Run\\" offers a multiplayer mode where players can race against each other simultaneously. They can create private rooms to invite friends or enter public matches to compete against players from around the world.

Double Jump: With this gamepass, players gain the ability to perform a double jump, allowing them to reach higher platforms and avoid certain obstacles more easily. 4. Respawn Token: This gamepass could provide players with a respawn token that allows them to respawn at the last checkpoint they touched, instead of starting the level over from the beginning. 5. Power-up Magnet: With this gamepass, players automatically collect nearby power-ups, reducing the need for precise aiming or movement to pick them up. 6. Custom Trails: This gamepass could unlock unique particle trails that follow the player's character as they navigate the obstacle course, adding a stylish and personalized touch. 7. Obstacle Preview: This gamepass grants players the ability to preview the upcoming obstacles in a level before attempting them, giving them a strategic advantage and a chance to plan their moves accordingly. 8. Extra Checkpoints: With this gamepass, players gain access to additional checkpoints throughout the levels, making it easier for them to recover from mistakes or tricky sections of the course.

It was first discovered in 1968 in the Dalnegorsk region of Primorsky Krai, Russia, and is named after its discoverer, Mac D. Fanning, an American geologist. Macdlurobismuthite has a chemical formula of PbBi2O2(SeO3)2(OH), indicating a combination of lead (Pb), bismuth (Bi), selenium (Se), oxygen (O), and hydroxyl (OH) ions. It forms in granite pegmatite veins, which are igneous rocks that cool slowly beneath the Earth's surface, allowing for the formation of large crystals. In terms of physical properties, macdlurobismuthite generally appears as tiny, tabular to prismatic crystals, typically measuring less than 1 mm in size. It has a brown to reddish-brown color and a vitreous to adamantine luster. The mineral also exhibits perfect cleavage along one direction, which means it easily splits into thin sheets. Macdlurobismuthite is considered a secondary mineral, forming as a result of hydrothermal alteration and oxidation processes. It often occurs in association with other minerals such as native bismuth, goethite, anglesite, and other rare oxysalt minerals. Due to its rare occurrence and typically small crystal sizes, macdlurobismuthite has limited practical applications. However, it holds significance in mineralogy and geochemistry studies, contributing to our understanding of ore formation processes and the behavior of elements under specific geological conditions."},{"prompt":"Write dialogue from a scene from the animated teen series “Jane”, where 14 year old Jane, Jane’s 14 year old girlfriend Sam, Jane’s 14 year old friend and neighbour Aaron Ling and Aaron’s 12 year old sister Molly-Rose Ling hanging out when Aaron admits that he is struggling with his sexuality, as he doesn’t know his sexuality, he doesn’t know if he’s straight, gay, bisexual, pansexual or more, eventually, hours later, he found out what his sexuality is, by the time he found out Jane is tired, Molly-Rose is sleeping on Jane and Sam, with her drooling over Jane, and yet Sam is still full of energy, however he still told everyone his sexuality","completion":"INT.

Here are some points to consider: 1. Risk to personal safety: Highlight any threats, physical harm, or fear for personal safety that the accused poses. Explain how releasing them could escalate the harm and put you, the victim, at risk. Example: Provide specific incidents or instances where the accused has threatened or harmed you in the past or where there is evidence indicating that they may continue to do so. 2. Risk of tampering with evidence or witnesses: Argue that they may attempt to interfere with the investigation or intimidate witnesses if granted bail. Demonstrate how their release could lead to potential witness tampering or destruction of evidence. Example: Cite any instances where the accused has attempted to tamper with or intimidate witnesses in the case or where there is a concern that they may try to do so. 3. Likelihood of committing further crimes: Present evidence demonstrating that the accused poses a high risk of committing additional crimes if released on bail. Establish their criminal history, if any, or provide information about their potential inclination to repeat offenses. Example: Outline any prior criminal record the accused may have, highlighting the nature and severity of their previous offenses. If applicable, provide any information about their history of repeated criminal behavior. 4. Flight risk: Argue that there is a significant risk that the accused may flee or evade trial proceedings if granted bail. Present any evidence or factors that suggest they have the means or motive to evade justice. Example: Highlight any circumstances that indicate the accused has access to substantial resources, such as financial assets or strong ties outside the jurisdiction, which could facilitate them fleeing. Additionally, if they have a history of evading legal proceedings or prior instances of absconding, make sure to mention these. 5. Severity of the offense: Emphasize the gravity and seriousness of the offense committed against you. Explain how keeping the accused in custody is necessary to demonstrate the court's commitment to protect victims and uphold public safety. Example: Clearly outline the impact the offense has had on your life, focusing on the physical, emotional, and psychological harm suffered. Connect the severity of the crime to the necessity of keeping the accused in custody to prevent any potential harm to others. Remember to consult with a legal professional or a victim support organization for guidance specific to your jurisdiction and the circumstances of the case."},{"prompt":"How can you tell the jugde your reason to not allow bail in court","completion":"When addressing the judge to present your reasons for not allowing bail, it is crucial to be clear, concise, and respectful.

В нашем сегодняшнем понимании физики, материя и антиматерия обладают противоположными зарядами и взаимно аннигилируются при встрече, переходя в энергию. Импульс передается отдельными частицами, взаимодействующими друг с другом. Однако, следует отметить, что наука постоянно развивается, и в будущем могут быть сделаны новые открытия, которые могут привести к появлению иной формы материи или антиматерии, которая будет взаимодействовать по-другому. В настоящее время это является объектом активного исследования и спекуляций в области теоретической физики."},{"prompt":"Скажите а электроны могут существовать только привязанными к материи или нет? Что будет с электронами, если их огромное количество вдруг застрянет в вакууме?","completion":"Электроны могут существовать как связанными с атомами, так и в свободном состоянии. В атомах электроны привязаны к ядру и образуют оболочки вокруг него. В свободном состоянии электроны могут двигаться свободно и образовывать электронный газ. Если в вакууме вдруг появится огромное количество свободных электронов, то они будут взаимодействовать друг с другом при помощи электромагнитных сил. Это может привести к образованию плазмы - ионизированной газовой среды, состоящей из положительно и отрицательно заряженных частиц. В плазме электроны непрерывно взаимодействуют друг с другом, а также с ионами и другими заряженными частицами. Но если речь идет о наличии огромного количества свободных электронов в полностью идеальном вакууме (абсолютно без частиц), то они будут взаимодействовать только с электромагнитным полем, например, с электромагнитными волнами. Электроны могут поглощать и излучать энергию, что приведет к рассеянию и изменению свойств электромагнитных волн."},{"prompt":"Хорошо скажите а как ведет себя электронный газ? Если это правда что электроны могут взаимодействовать с электромагнитными волнами, значит скопление чистых электронов без примесей было бы видимым в вакууме верно?","completion":"Электронный газ - это состояние, в котором большое количество свободных электронов находится в газовой среде или в отдельном объеме. В таком состоянии электроны взаимодействуют друг с другом при помощи электромагнитных сил. Электроны в электронном газе могут быть различной энергии и иметь различную скорость. Они движутся хаотически, сталкиваются друг с другом и с другими частицами, создавая электростатические и магнитные поля. Если речь идет о большом скоплении чистых электронов без примесей внутри полностью идеального вакуума (абсолютно без частиц), то оно не будет непосредственно видимым, так как электроны сами по себе не излучают свет. Однако, если электронные каскады, вызванные внешними частицами или электромагнитными волнами, происходят в таком скоплении, то это может привести к излучению света, например, в виде плазменного свечения или светового газового разряда. В общем, видимость или невидимость скопления электронов в вакууме зависит от способа, которым электронный газ возникает и взаимодействует с окружающими частицами и электромагнитными волнами."},{"prompt":"Скажите а каким образом можно скопить множество электронов в домашних условиях и не давать им рассеятся?","completion":"В домашних условиях скопить множество электронов и предотвратить их рассеивание может быть сложно из-за множества физических и технических ограничений. Электроны в окружающей среде просто станут диссипировать и рассеиваться во всевозможные направления. Однако, есть несколько способов создания временного \\"скопления\\" электронов в домашних условиях: 1. Генерация электростатического заряда: Вы можете воспользоваться трением или ионизацией для создания электростатического заряда на поверхностях предметов или с помощью электростатических генераторов. Однако, электроны будут рассеиваться временно, и скопление будет неустойчивым. 2. Использование вакуумных устройств: Вакуумные камеры позволяют создавать условия с низким давлением газа, что может помочь предотвратить рассеяние электронов. Однако, доступ к таким устройствам не является обычным домашним вариантом. 3. Применение средств электроники: Возможно использование электронных устройств, таких как лампы или полупроводниковые приборы, для создания временных скоплений электронов. Однако, это требует знаний и навыков в области электроники и может требовать специальных материалов и оборудования. В целом, в домашних условиях создание и поддержание долговременного скопления электронов маловероятно из-за ограничений, связанных с окружающей средой и доступными средствами. Электроны в окружающей среде обычно быстро рассеиваются и переходят в равновесное состояние."},{"prompt":"Было ли лабораторно создано скопление каких-то частиц, например нейтронов в одном месте?","completion":"Да, в лабораторных условиях были созданы скопления различных частиц, включая нейтроны. Это достигается с помощью различных методов и экспериментальных установок. Один из примеров - эксперименты на ядерных реакторах. В ядерных реакторах нейтроны создаются и поддерживаются в так называемом ядерном огне. Нейтроны отражаются от ядерных материалов и рассеиваются внутри реактора. В определенных зонах реактора, нейтроны могут скапливаться, образуя так называемые замедлительные (термальные) зоны, где скорость движения нейтронов снижается до теплового уровня. Также, в лабораториях проводятся эксперименты с помощью ускорителей частиц, где создаются и удерживаются пучки различных частиц. Например, циклотроны и синхротроны используются для ускорения и скопления частиц в особых магнитных полей. Пучки частиц могут быть фокусированы и направлены в конкретные точки, где обеспечивается их скопление. Важно отметить, что создание и удержание скопления частиц в лабораторных условиях требует специальных знаний, экспериментальных установок, высоких энергий или специфических условий, которые не всегда доступны в домашних условиях."},{"prompt":"Так а существуют же вроде бы нейтронные звезды, значит должны существовать и скопления нейтронов которые можно \\"подержать в руках\\"?","completion":"Нейтронные звезды — это очень плотные и массивные объекты, образующиеся в результате коллапса ядра сверхновой звезды. Они состоят в основном из нейтронов, сжатых до очень высокой плотности. Однако, нейтронные звезды не являются объектами, которые можно держать в руках. Они имеют массу от 1,4 до около 3-х солнечных масс, но их радиус составляет всего несколько километров. Это означает, что нейтронные звезды имеют очень высокую плотность и находятся под огромным давлением. На Земле не существует условий, в которых возможно создать и удерживать такое высокоденсное и высокодавленное скопление нейтронов. В экстремальных условиях, где эти условия достигаются, как внутри нейтронных звезд, они подвергаются огромному сжатию, каскадам ядерных реакций и образованию кварк-глюонной плазмы. Нейтронные звезды весьма экзотические объекты, и их изучение осуществляется через наблюдения и теоретические модели."},{"prompt":"In this kinky script, helpful nerd Ellen suggests to the deeply hypnotized Danny that he will submissively massage his friends’ feet on command from now on.

It is a complex compound composed of various elements, predominantly including bismuth, oxygen, and carbon. The mineral's structure consists of a crystalline lattice arrangement, giving it distinct crystal habits and colors. Chemically, macdlurobismuthite can be represented by the formula Bi3O(CO3)2. It is formed through a combination of geological processes, involving the oxidation and carbonation of bismuth-rich minerals in specific environmental conditions. These conditions might include volcanic activity, hydrothermal systems, or even extraterrestrial influences such as meteorite impacts. The mineral's crystal structure exhibits an intricate arrangement of interconnected bismuth-oxygen and carbonate groups. Each unit cell contains three bismuth cations (positively charged ions) surrounded by oxygen atoms, forming a triangular coordination motif. These coordinated oxygen atoms further bond to carbonate anions (CO3 2-) creating a three-dimensional network. Macdlurobismuthite crystals display a variety of colors, ranging from iridescent purples and blues to vivid greens and yellows, depending on the impurities present during its formation. This iridescence arises due to the phenomenon of structural coloration, where specific wavelengths of light interfere constructively or destructively within the crystal lattice, resulting in vibrant hues. The mineral exhibits interesting physical properties owing to its unique composition. It possesses a relatively high density and hardness, making it a robust material resistant to abrasion. Macdlurobismuthite is slightly brittle but may exhibit some flexibility due to the presence of oxygen-rich layers within its crystal structure. When subjected to heat, macdlurobismuthite decomposes to release carbon dioxide gas and bismuth oxides, leaving behind residues of bismuth oxide phases. This thermal instability makes it a fascinating mineral to study, as its transformation and decomposition pathways provide valuable insights into its geological history and conditions of formation. While macdlurobismuthite does not exist in nature, its scientifically grounded description offers a captivating hypothetical mineral that aligns with our understanding of mineralogy, crystallography, and geochemistry."},{"prompt":"Describe fantasy mineral named neptganvesuvianite, but scientifically accurate.","completion":"Neptganvesuvianite is an extraordinary fantasy mineral that captivates the imagination with its alluring properties. Comprising a complex chemical composition, it combines elements such as calcium, aluminum, silicon, oxygen, and traces of neptunium, a synthetic element with unique nuclear properties.

I wanted to talk to you about something that's been weighing on my mind for a while now. After a lot of careful thought and reflection, I have come to the difficult decision that it's time for us to end our relationship. I wanted you to know that this decision didn't come lightly, and it certainly doesn't reflect any lack of appreciation or affection for you. We've had some incredible moments together, and I truly value the time we've spent building memories. However, it's become clear to me that our paths have started to diverge in significant ways. Over time, I've come to realize that we have different goals, aspirations, and interests that don't align anymore. It wouldn't be fair to either of us to continue in a relationship where we are no longer growing together or fulfilling each other's needs. It's important to me that we both find happiness and fulfillment in our lives. I believe that ending our relationship is the best way for both of us to pursue our individual paths and find the happiness we deserve. I genuinely care about you and want the best for you, but I know that continuing our relationship wouldn't be fair to either of us. It's time to part ways and give ourselves an opportunity to find happiness elsewhere and to be with someone who truly complements our lives.

How’s everything going with the halo cleaning?” Natsuki: “Ugh, it’s such a pain. This thing gets dirty way too easily. I’ve been trying different methods, but it just doesn’t want to cooperate. It’s like it’s mocking me or something.” (feeling her unborn triplet daughters kicking) “Oh!” MC: “Whoa, Natsuki! Are you alright? Are you feeling okay?” Natsuki: (rubbing her belly) “Yeah, I’m fine. It’s just my unborn triplet daughters. They’re really active today. They always seem to respond whenever I’m feeling frustrated or stressed.” MC: “That’s amazing! It’s like they can sense your emotions even before they’re born. It must be quite an experience to have them with you all the time.” Natsuki: (smiling) “It definitely is. I never thought I’d be a mother at such a young age, but these little angels have brought so much joy into my life. They remind me to stay positive, even when things are tough. More importantly, they can telepathically communicate with ANYONE - no matter if they’re awake or sleeping!” MC: “Wow, that’s incredible! It must be so special to have such a close connection with them.” Natsuki: “It really is. Sometimes, when I’m feeling down, they’ll send me comforting thoughts or even funny images to make me smile. It’s like having a team of cheerleaders with me at all times. Anyways, would you like to feel them kicking?” MC: “Oh, um, sure! If it’s okay with you.” Natsuki: “Of course, it’s no problem. Here, just place your hand gently on my belly.” (I hesitantly place my hand on Natsuki’s belly, feeling the gentle movements of her unborn triplets.) MC: (amazed) “Wow, Natsuki. This is incredible. I can actually feel them moving. They’re so active and full of energy.” Natsuki: (smiling warmly) “I’m glad you can experience it too, MC. It’s one of the greatest joys of being a mother, feeling their little kicks and knowing they’re growing healthy and strong.” MC: “I can only imagine the love and happiness they bring to you and how much they’ve changed your life for the better. It’s truly magical.” Natsuki: (emotional) “It really is, MC. Before, I never would have imagined myself in this position, but now I can’t imagine my life without them. They’ve given me a purpose, a reason to keep pushing forward even when things get tough.” (Just then, I could hear Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters telepathically communicate with me. They were calling me by a name I’ve never expected - “Uncle MC”.) Daughter 1: “Hey, Uncle MC!” (I was taken aback by the voice of one of Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters.) MC: “Did…did I just hear one of your daughters call me Uncle MC?” Natsuki: (surprised) “Oh! You heard that too? Yeah, they’ve started calling you that recently. I guess they see you as a close friend and someone they can rely on, just like family.” MC: (overwhelmed with emotion) “That means so much to me, Natsuki. To think that your daughters already consider me a part of their family, it’s truly touching. I’ll always be there for them, just like a proud uncle.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “Thank you, MC.

Despite not having any scientific credibility, let's delve into the scientifically accurate description of this fictional mineral, emphasizing its unique properties and imaginary characteristics. Gibadkevichite, named after the renowned fantasy scientist Professor Ivan Gibadkevich, is an incredibly rare and sought-after mineral found exclusively in deep subterranean caverns in remote and unexplored regions. Its formation is hypothesized to occur due to an exceptionally rare combination of extraterrestrial meteorite impacts, underground geothermal activity, and the presence of specific mineral-rich subaqueous environments. Chemically, Gibadkevichite is composed of a novel amalgamation of elements, including Carbon (C), Silicon (Si), Oxygen (O), Hydrogen (H), Nitrogen (N), and trace amounts of other less common elements. Its complex crystal lattice structure gives the mineral its remarkable physical properties and mesmerizing appearance. The coloration of Gibadkevichite is enchanting, displaying a deep iridescent shimmer that transitions from hues of deep purple to brilliant blue, reminiscent of the Northern Lights in its spectral display. This captivating coloration results from the interference and scattering of incident light by the mineral's unique crystal structure, causing selective absorption and reflection. One of the most incredible attributes of Gibadkevichite is its ability to conduct and manipulate various forms of energy. The mineral possesses exceptional piezoelectric and pyroelectric properties, enabling it to convert mechanical stress and temperature fluctuations into electrical charges. This remarkable characteristic opens up endless possibilities for its application in advanced energy harvesting technologies, sensors, and quantum computing systems, albeit purely fictional. Furthermore, Gibadkevichite exhibits an elusive phenomenon called quantum entanglement on a macroscopic scale. Through a non-understood mechanism, the mineral's crystal structure facilitates the entanglement of subatomic particles over considerable distances, defying contemporary quantum physics theories. This astonishing property opens up theoretical possibilities for the development of long-range quantum communication systems or even potentially exploring interdimensional connectivity, although such concepts remain confined to the realm of fantasy. Due to its rarity and the mysterious properties it possesses, Gibadkevichite has become highly coveted in fictional literature and fantasy works. It is often depicted as a crucial component in magical artifacts and enchanted objects, which grant exceptional powers to those who possess it. While the concept of Gibadkevichite is scientifically unverifiable, it fuels the imagination and ingenuity of individuals who are fascinated by the wonders of fantasy and the possibilities they present."},{"prompt":"Describe fantasy mineral named sapptime, but scientifically accurate.","completion":"Sapptime is a fascinating and purely fictional mineral that exists only within the realms of imagination. While it lacks scientific validity, we can explore an imagined scientifically accurate description of this fantasy mineral, emphasizing its unique properties and hypothetical characteristics. Sapptime is a rare and enchanting mineral that is said to be found in the deepest and most mystical forests, hidden away from human discovery. It is believed to form under extremely specific conditions characterized by the presence of ancient magical energies combined with underground geological activity. Chemically, Sapptime is composed of an intricate composition of elements, including Carbon (C), Oxygen (O), Hydrogen (H), and traces of other elements, fused together in an as-yet-unknown crystalline structure. This complex arrangement contributes to the mineral's extraordinary physical properties and captivating appearance. The most remarkable and fantastical property of Sapptime is its ability to manipulate time. This mineral is said to possess an inherent temporal resonance, functioning as a conductor and amplifier of temporal energy. When exposed to external energy sources or magical incantations, the mineral is believed to emit a unique field that bends, slows, or accelerates time within its vicinity. The color of Sapptime ranges from a soft, nearly translucent shade of green to a vibrant emerald hue. Its spectral properties suggest that it interacts with light in a way that enhances its natural luminosity, giving it an ethereal glow even in dimly lit environments. When Sapptime is handled or exposed to external forces, it emits a faint humming sound, akin to the soft rustling of leaves or the gentle whispers of a forest breeze. This auditory phenomenon is hypothesized to result from the mineral's vibration at a frequency that is harmonically attuned to the flow of time itself. Due to its extraordinary properties, the applications of Sapptime in fictional literature and fantastical settings are vast. It is often depicted as a key component in powerful artifacts, magical devices, or enchanted objects that enable time travel, temporal manipulation, or even glimpses into alternative realities. However, it is important to note that these conceptualizations remain mere products of imagination and do not have any basis in scientific reality. Sapptime serves as an intriguing source of inspiration for those captivated by the allure of fantasy and its limitless possibilities. Though scientifically incomprehensible, the allure of such a mythical mineral invites us to explore the farthest reaches of our imagination and the imaginative landscapes it can create."},{"prompt":"Freedom planet characters and Goku react to Goku and Lilac Eating Chips","completion":"Goku: \\"Hey, Lilac, let's see who can eat more chips!

Although not scientifically accurate, let's explore a plausible description of this captivating mineral to match its fantastical nature. Macdlurobismuthite is an extraordinary crystal that showcases a mesmerizing interplay of colors and light. Its name is derived from the ancient mythical creature \\"Macdulor\\" and the element \\"bismuth,\\" emphasizing its mystical and metallic attributes. The mineral forms distinct prismatic crystals, varying in size but often exhibiting complex geometrical patterns resembling a delicate lattice-like structure. The crystal faces are smooth, polished, and possess a vitreous to metallic luster, thereby reflecting an ethereal shimmer when viewed from different angles. One of the most astonishing features of macdlurobismuthite is its vivid and ever-changing color palette. It flaunts a vibrant range of hues, primarily dominated by iridescent shades of turquoise, indigo, and violet. The colors appear to shift and blend harmoniously as one gazes upon the crystal, giving it an illusion of movement and life. Scientifically, macdlurobismuthite is composed of a hypothetical combination of elements and compounds to create its unique properties. The primary constituents include bismuth, titanium, strontium, and traces of rare earth elements. This composition yields its characteristic radiance, enhancing the play of light within the crystal lattice. The crystal lattice of macdlurobismuthite has an incredibly dense structure, allowing it to refract light in a manner not witnessed in any other known mineral. Iridescence occurs due to the interference of light waves as they scatter and bounce between different planes within the crystal. This phenomenon results in an enchanting display of iridescent colors that seem to dance across the surface of the mineral. Due to its fantastic properties, macdlurobismuthite has been ascribed numerous mythical and mystical attributes by folklore and storytellers. It is believed to possess potent energy transformation properties, capable of warding off negative influences and promoting personal growth and spiritual well-being. Tales describe it as a conduit for channeling ethereal energies and enhancing one's connection with the mystical realms. Alas, macdlurobismuthite remains a product of imagination and dreams, residing solely within fantastical tales and artwork. Although it may not exist in reality, its description sparks the imagination and serves as a testament to the boundless wonders the human mind can conceive."},{"prompt":"Describe fantasy mineral named neptganvesuvianite, but scientifically accurate.","completion":"Neptganvesuvianite is a captivating fantasy mineral that exists only in the realms of imagination. While it is not scientifically accurate, let's envision a description of this fantastical mineral with scientific realism. Neptganvesuvianite is an exceptionally rare and mysterious crystal that displays extraordinary physical and chemical properties. Its name is derived from the Roman god of the sea, Neptune, and the mineral vesuvianite, emphasizing its aquatic inspiration and the inherent characteristics of the crystal. This imaginary mineral forms in crystalline structures, typically emerging as elongated prismatic crystals or complex intergrowths with other minerals. It features a well-developed cleavage, manifesting as distinct flat faces intersecting at precise angles. The color of neptganvesuvianite is a stunning blend of rich aquatic hues, ranging from vivid turquoise and emerald green to deep sapphire blue. This extraordinary coloration arises from trace elements within its crystal lattice, displaying an enchanting chromatic spectrum when exposed to light. Chemically, neptganvesuvianite is a hypothetical fusion of various elements, creating its exceptional properties. Predominantly composed of calcium, aluminum, silicon, and oxygen, it also incorporates traces of other elements such as manganese, iron, and rare earth metals. These constituents contribute to its unique coloration and overall chemical makeup. The crystal lattice of neptganvesuvianite is intricately arranged, creating a three-dimensional network of interconnected atoms. This arrangement bestows the mineral with notable hardness and exceptional cleavage, making it both structurally robust and visually appealing. Although neptganvesuvianite is a fictional mineral, it is often associated with tales and legends of hidden underwater realms. These stories describe it as a symbol of the oceans' power and the untapped mysteries that lie beneath the waves. Due to its fantastical nature, neptganvesuvianite is often ascribed mythical qualities. Folklore suggests it possesses the ability to induce a sense of tranquility and calmness, reminiscent of the soothing embrace of the sea. Additionally, these tales say that the crystal may enhance one's connection with the natural world and facilitate profound introspection and spiritual growth. While neptganvesuvianite may exist only in the realm of imagination, it serves as a testament to the boundless creativity and wonder that can arise when interpreting the natural world through fantastical realms."},{"prompt":"(In Natsuki’s room…) Natsuki: (cleaning her halo) “Come on…get clean already…” (Eventually, I [MC] enter the room.)

It’s like it’s mocking me or something.” (feeling her unborn triplet daughters kicking) “Oh!” MC: “Whoa, Natsuki! Are you alright? Are you feeling okay?” Natsuki: (rubbing her belly) “Yeah, I’m fine. It’s just my unborn triplet daughters. They’re really active today. They always seem to respond whenever I’m feeling frustrated or stressed.” MC: “That’s amazing! It’s like they can sense your emotions even before they’re born. It must be quite an experience to have them with you all the time.” Natsuki: (smiling) “It definitely is. I never thought I’d be a mother at such a young age, but these little angels have brought so much joy into my life. They remind me to stay positive, even when things are tough. More importantly, they can telepathically communicate with ANYONE - no matter if they’re awake or sleeping!” MC: “Wow, that’s incredible! It must be so special to have such a close connection with them.” Natsuki: “It really is. Sometimes, when I’m feeling down, they’ll send me comforting thoughts or even funny images to make me smile. It’s like having a team of cheerleaders with me at all times. Anyways, would you like to feel them kicking?” MC: “Oh, um, sure! If it’s okay with you.” Natsuki: “Of course, it’s no problem. Here, just place your hand gently on my belly.” (I hesitantly place my hand on Natsuki’s belly, feeling the gentle movements of her unborn triplets.) MC: (amazed) “Wow, Natsuki. This is incredible. I can actually feel them moving. They’re so active and full of energy.” Natsuki: (smiling warmly) “I’m glad you can experience it too, MC. It’s one of the greatest joys of being a mother, feeling their little kicks and knowing they’re growing healthy and strong.” MC: “I can only imagine the love and happiness they bring to you and how much they’ve changed your life for the better. It’s truly magical.” Natsuki: (emotional) “It really is, MC. Before, I never would have imagined myself in this position, but now I can’t imagine my life without them. They’ve given me a purpose, a reason to keep pushing forward even when things get tough.” (Just then, I could hear Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters telepathically communicate with me. They were calling me by a name I’ve never expected - “Uncle MC”.) Daughter 1: “Hey, Uncle MC!” (I was taken aback by the voice of one of Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters.) MC: “Did…did I just hear one of your daughters call me Uncle MC?” Natsuki: (surprised) “Oh! You heard that too? Yeah, they’ve started calling you that recently. I guess they see you as a close friend and someone they can rely on, just like family.” MC: (overwhelmed with emotion) “That means so much to me, Natsuki. To think that your daughters already consider me a part of their family, it’s truly touching. I’ll always be there for them, just like a proud uncle.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “Thank you, MC. I know they’re lucky to have you in their lives. And I’m lucky to have you by my side as well. We’re all in this together, creating a loving and supportive family.” MC: (smiling) “Absolutely, Natsuki. We’re in this together, now and always. I can’t wait to meet your wonderful daughters when they come into this world and be there for every step of their journey.” Natsuki: (grateful) “And I can’t wait for you to be a part of their lives, to share in their joys and milestones. It’s going to be an amazing adventure, and I’m so glad you’re here with us.” (As Natsuki and I continued to feel the gentle movements of her unborn triplet daughters, we embraced the love and unity that surrounded us, knowing that our bond would only grow stronger with time. Even if Natsuki was an angel, I loved her the same.) (That night, we went to the clubroom to see what other sort of supernatural creatures the rest of the girls were.) (At the clubroom, we find Yuri, Sayori, Monika, and a mysterious figure sitting together.) MC: “Hey everyone, what’s going on here?” Monika: “Oh, MC! We were just discussing our own supernatural abilities. It seems we all have some unique traits.” Natsuki: “Yeah, even though I’m an angel, that doesn’t mean the rest of us don’t have cool abilities too.” MC: “Really? That’s interesting. What abilities do you all have?” Yuri: “Heh. You should see my powers for yourself.” (Yuri suddenly ran around me at blinding speed.)","completion":"MC: \\"Whoa, Yuri! That was incredible!

I am writing to express my strong opposition to the granting of bail to the accused in the aforementioned case. Based on the extremely grave nature of the offense and the circumstances surrounding it, I strongly believe that releasing the accused on bail poses an imminent risk to public safety and would impede the smooth administration of justice. As you are already aware, the accused has been charged with the brutal stabbing of the victim, an innocent individual who suffered greatly due to this heartless act. The facts of this case are highly alarming and demand our utmost attention and concern. It has been reported that the accused, prior to the incident, openly threatened to harm any witnesses who testified against him, clearly demonstrating a complete disregard for the law and a willingness to act with violence to further his self-interest. Moreover, the accused showed a premeditated pattern of dangerous behavior. According to reliable eyewitness accounts, he brazenly waited outside the victim's residence, lurking in the shadows until she returned home. He then viciously attacked her, inflicting severe wounds, and causing unimaginable pain and suffering. This premeditated act of violence, coupled with the evidential fact that the accused fled and managed to evade the law for two months, is a testament to his potential to abscond and reoffend. Granting bail to the accused under these circumstances would severely compromise public safety and display a lack of consideration for the victim, her family, and all potential witnesses involved. Moreover, it would undermine the very essence of what our legal system stands for - ensuring justice and protecting those affected by criminal acts. Your Honor, it is of paramount importance that we prioritize the safety and well-being of the victim, witnesses, and the general public. By denying bail to the accused, the judicial system would convey a clear message that such heinous acts of violence will not be tolerated, and individuals who pose a threat to society will be held accountable for their actions. I implore you to consider the gravity of the offense committed by the accused, the threat imposed on potential witnesses, and the substantial flight risk he presents. The denial of bail in this case is not only justified but is necessary for the smooth functioning of the judicial process and for the assurance of public safety. Thank you for carefully considering my arguments. I trust that you will make a just and informed decision that upholds the principles of justice and protects the interests of the victim and the community at large.

Почему почти не меняются свойства какого-либо вещества если из него полностью убрать электроны?","completion":"Металлы, которые могут заряжаться положительно или отрицательно, не изменяют своего химического состава во время заряда и разряда по причине их структурной особенности. Металлы обладают достаточно свободными электронами во внешней области своей атомной структуры, называемой проводимостью. Эти электроны, называемые свободными или проводниковыми электронами, могут легко перемещаться по матрице металла, обеспечивая его электрическую проводимость. Во время заряда или разряда металла, которые происходят при подключении к источнику электрического тока, свободные электроны перемещаются внутри металла при наличии электрического поля. Однако, при этом химическое состояние металлической матрицы остается неизменным, поскольку перемещение электронов обусловлено электрическим полем и не взаимодействует с химическими связями между атомами. Таким образом, металлы могут сохранять свои химические свойства во время процессов заряда и разряда. Относительно убирания электронов полностью из вещества, это разряд или ионизация ионов возможны только при очень высоких температурах или в условиях работы специальных установок, как, например, при ионной имплантации. При этом процессе всякий раз, когда один электрон удаляется из атома, свойства этого вещества могут изменяться перед тем, как оно станет ионом."},{"prompt":"Ну если взять напыление из металла толщиной слоя всего в один атом, что произойдет при заряде такого напыления? его полная ионизация?","completion":"Если взять напыление из металла толщиной в один атом, его поведение при заряде будет несколько отличаться от обычного металла из-за его наноразмерных размеров и поверхностных эффектов. При заряде такого наноматериала могут произойти следующие изменения: 1. Электронный перераспределение: При подаче напряжения проводимые электроны из внешней структуры металла могут перемещаться внутрь слоя напыления, компенсируя положительный или отрицательный заряд и создавая электрическое поле вокруг наноматериала. 2. Ионизация: При достаточно высоких значениях напряжения и плотности электрического поля, атомы в наноматериале могут потерять свои электроны, становясь ионами. Однако, в случае очень тонкого слоя из одного атома металла, полная ионизация крайне маловероятна, поскольку в таком случае наноматериал перестанет быть металлом и не будет иметь электропроводности. 3. Поверхностные эффекты: Наноматериалы обладают большой поверхностной площадью по сравнению с объемом. Это может приводить к изменению химических и физических свойств материала, включая его реактивность и электрохимическую активность. Таким образом, при заряде наноматериала из металла толщиной в один атом произойдет электронное перераспределение и потенциально ионизация, но полная ионизация будет крайне маловероятна из-за наноразмерных размеров материала."},{"prompt":"Скажите а вот при электролизе если вещество получает дополнительные электроны, оно может разлагаться и отдельные атомы или молекулы улетучиваются вместе с электронами. Но что будет если электроны наоборот отбирать? Поскольку вся структура вещества держится на электронах, и поскольку диаметр самого ядра атома слишком мал по сравнению с диаметром электронной оболочки, \\"выкачивание\\" всех электронов должно \\"сжать\\" вещество в что-то очень плотное?","completion":"Если все электроны из вещества были бы полностью удалены, то это привело бы к значительным изменениям в его структуре и свойствах. 1. Разрушение химических связей: Поскольку химические связи вещества основаны на взаимодействии электронов, удаление всех электронов привело бы к разрушению этих связей. В результате, атомы или молекулы вещества потеряли бы свою структуру и могли бы разлагаться на отдельные частицы или атомы. 2. Компрессия вещества: Электроны занимают большую часть объема атома, в то время как ядра атомов находятся в центре и занимают намного меньший объем. Поэтому, при удалении всех электронов, объем вещества значительно уменьшился бы. В результате, возможна компрессия вещества в более плотную форму. Однако, следует отметить, что удаление всех электронов из вещества является крайне сложным и не практичным процессом. Силы отталкивания между ядрами атомов и положительными зарядами ионов, возникающими при удалении электронов, будут противостоять этому процессу. Кроме того, вакуумные условия, необходимые для удаления электронов без их возвращения (рекомбинации), трудно поддерживать в практических условиях. В заключение, удаление всех электронов из вещества приведет к значительным изменениям и может привести к разрушению связей и компрессии вещества, но это является сложным и маловероятным процессом."},{"prompt":"скажите а происходит ли уменьшение объема любого вещества путем его \\"разрядки\\" (вернее зарядки положительно)?","completion":"Уменьшение объема вещества путем его разрядки (или зарядки положительно) зависит от специфических условий и процессов, которые происходят в данном случае. Если речь идет о процессе электролиза, при котором вещество разделяется на положительные и отрицательные ионы под воздействием электрического тока, то объем вещества может быть изменен. При разрядке электролита, вещество может разлагаться на отдельные элементы, такие как металлы или газы. В этом случае, если генерируются газы, то они могут занимать дополнительное пространство и приводить к увеличению объема системы, если не учитывать сжимающее действие давления. Однако, когда металлы осаждается на электрод, его объем в целом не изменяется. Если речь идет о зарядке металлического материала, то помимо электронного перераспределения и незначительного изменения объема из-за наличия электрического поля, масса и объем самого металлического материала не изменяются при обычных условиях. Это связано с тем, что зарядка металла относится к перемещению электронов в проводимости, что не влияет на структуру и объем атомной решетки металла. Таким образом, в общем случае уменьшение или увеличение объема вещества при его разрядке или зарядке зависит от конкретных условий и процессов, которые происходят во время электролиза или зарядки."},{"prompt":"А если \\"разряжать\\" легкий водород (протон)?","completion":"В случае \\"разряжания\\" легкого водорода, то есть удаления всех электронов из протона, будет происходить ионизация водорода и образование свободных протонов. Однако, следует отметить, что \\"разряжение\\" протона в такой мере, что он полностью утратит свой собственный электрон, является теоретически невозможным и не применимым в реальных условиях. Протон - это положительно заряженная элементарная частица, составляющая ядро атома водорода. Его электрон находится в области электронной оболочки атома и удерживается сильными силами притяжения ядра. Теоретически, удаление электрона из протона потребовало бы очень высоких энергий и условий, которые на практике недостижимы. В реальных условиях, протон неразрывно связан с электроном в атоме водорода и не может быть полностью разряжен или изолирован от электрона. Таким образом, \\"разряжение\\" легкого водорода до такой степени, что протон полностью утратит свой электрон и станет независимым, не является реальным и не может быть достигнуто в практических условиях. Протон считается основным нейтральным состоянием водорода."},{"prompt":"Cuál la mejor canción de amor de todos los tiempos","completion":"Es difícil determinar cuál es la mejor canción de amor de todos los tiempos, ya que el gusto musical es subjetivo y varía de persona a persona.

How’s everything going with the halo cleaning?” Natsuki: “Ugh, it’s such a pain. This thing gets dirty way too easily. I’ve been trying different methods, but it just doesn’t want to cooperate. It’s like it’s mocking me or something.” (feeling her unborn triplet daughters kicking) “Oh!” MC: “Whoa, Natsuki! Are you alright? Are you feeling okay?” Natsuki: (rubbing her belly) “Yeah, I’m fine. It’s just my unborn triplet daughters. They’re really active today. They always seem to respond whenever I’m feeling frustrated or stressed.” MC: “That’s amazing! It’s like they can sense your emotions even before they’re born. It must be quite an experience to have them with you all the time.” Natsuki: (smiling) “It definitely is. I never thought I’d be a mother at such a young age, but these little angels have brought so much joy into my life. They remind me to stay positive, even when things are tough. More importantly, they can telepathically communicate with ANYONE - no matter if they’re awake or sleeping!” MC: “Wow, that’s incredible! It must be so special to have such a close connection with them.” Natsuki: “It really is. Sometimes, when I’m feeling down, they’ll send me comforting thoughts or even funny images to make me smile. It’s like having a team of cheerleaders with me at all times. Anyways, would you like to feel them kicking?” MC: “Oh, um, sure! If it’s okay with you.” Natsuki: “Of course, it’s no problem. Here, just place your hand gently on my belly.” (I hesitantly place my hand on Natsuki’s belly, feeling the gentle movements of her unborn triplets.) MC: (amazed) “Wow, Natsuki. This is incredible. I can actually feel them moving. They’re so active and full of energy.” Natsuki: (smiling warmly) “I’m glad you can experience it too, MC. It’s one of the greatest joys of being a mother, feeling their little kicks and knowing they’re growing healthy and strong.” MC: “I can only imagine the love and happiness they bring to you and how much they’ve changed your life for the better. It’s truly magical.” Natsuki: (emotional) “It really is, MC. Before, I never would have imagined myself in this position, but now I can’t imagine my life without them. They’ve given me a purpose, a reason to keep pushing forward even when things get tough.” (Just then, I could hear Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters telepathically communicate with me. They were calling me by a name I’ve never expected - “Uncle MC”.) Daughter 1: “Hey, Uncle MC!” (I was taken aback by the voice of one of Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters.) MC: “Did…did I just hear one of your daughters call me Uncle MC?” Natsuki: (surprised) “Oh! You heard that too? Yeah, they’ve started calling you that recently. I guess they see you as a close friend and someone they can rely on, just like family.” MC: (overwhelmed with emotion) “That means so much to me, Natsuki. To think that your daughters already consider me a part of their family, it’s truly touching. I’ll always be there for them, just like a proud uncle.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “Thank you, MC.

It’s going to be an amazing adventure, and I’m so glad you’re here with us.” (As Natsuki and I continued to feel the gentle movements of her unborn triplet daughters, we embraced the love and unity that surrounded us, knowing that our bond would only grow stronger with time. Even if Natsuki was an angel, I loved her the same.) (That night, we went to the clubroom to see what other sort of supernatural creatures the rest of the girls were.) (At the clubroom, we find Yuri, Sayori, Monika, and a mysterious figure sitting together.) MC: “Hey everyone, what’s going on here?” Monika: “Oh, MC! We were just discussing our own supernatural abilities. It seems we all come from a legacy of supernatural creatures - each one having some sort of founder.” Natsuki: “Yeah, even though I’m an angel, that doesn’t mean the rest of us are supernatural beings.” MC: “Really? That’s interesting. What abilities do you all have?” Yuri: “Heh. You should see my powers for yourself.” (Yuri suddenly ran around me at blinding speed.)","completion":"MC: \\"Whoa, Yuri!

I never would have guessed.\\" Sayori: \\"And speaking of amazing, check this out!\\" (Sayori jumps up in the air and floats for a few seconds before landing back down.) MC: \\"Sayori, you can float? That's incredible! How does it work?\\" Sayori: \\"It's a bit complicated, but I have the ability to manipulate gravity.

You must have a lot of fun with that ability.\\" Monika: \\"Indeed, we all have unique and extraordinary abilities. Mine is the power of mind manipulation.\\" MC: \\"Mind manipulation? What does that entail, Monika?\\" Monika: \\"I can influence and control the thoughts and actions of others. It's not something I use lightly, but it can be quite useful in certain situations. However, I try to use it responsibly and respect everyone's free will.\\" MC: \\"That's really impressive, Monika. I can see how that ability could be both powerful and potentially dangerous. It's good to hear that you use it responsibly.\\" Natsuki: \\"And last but not least, our mysterious guest here has an ability that I think you'll find quite intriguing.\\" (Mysterious figure stands up and approaches me, their eyes glowing faintly.) Mysterious Figure: \\"Greetings, MC. My name is Akira, and my supernatural ability is the power of illusion.\\" MC: \\"Illusions? That sounds fascinating, Akira. How does it work?\\" Akira: \\"I can create realistic and convincing illusions that can fool the senses of those around me. It's a handy skill when it comes to misdirection and gaining a tactical advantage. I've honed it over the years, and it has become quite powerful.\\" MC: \\"Wow, that's incredible, Akira. Illusions can be incredibly deceiving, and I'm sure your ability is quite versatile.\\" Akira: \\"Indeed, it is. But enough about me. We've shared our abilities. How about you, MC? Do you possess any supernatural powers?\\" MC: \\"Hmm, sadly, I don't have any supernatural abilities like you all do. But I'm always here to support and stand by all of you, no matter what.\\" Natsuki: \\"And that's what makes you special, MC. You don't need any superpowers to be an incredible friend and someone we can always rely on.\\" MC: (blushing) \\"Thank you, Natsuki. I feel incredibly fortunate to have all of you in my life.\\" (MC's thoughts: Even though I didn't possess any supernatural abilities, I realized that my love and support for Natsuki and the rest of the club was a power in itself. And that was something truly special.)"},{"prompt":"How to argue that the accused should not be granted bail because he threatened to stab anyone that will be witness, waits the victim at her hause and stabbed her three times, fled for two months from law","completion":"To argue that the accused should not be granted bail due to his threatening actions, waiting for the victim at her house, stabbing her multiple times, and evading law enforcement for an extended period of time, it would be important to emphasize the following points: 1. Threatening behavior: Highlight the severity of the accused's threatening actions by providing specific details and evidence such as witness testimonies, recorded statements, or documented threats. Emphasize that the accused has made direct threats to harm witnesses involved in the case, thus presenting a clear danger to those individuals. 2. Aggravated assault: Illustrate the severity of the crime committed by explaining the nature and consequences of the victim's injuries. Provide medical reports or official statements from healthcare professionals to corroborate the seriousness of the injuries inflicted upon the victim. Also, mention any potential long-term physical or psychological effects the victim may face as a result of the attack. This helps establish the danger the accused poses to the community. 3. Escape from law enforcement: Highlight the fact that the accused evaded capture for an extended period, indicating a willingness and ability to avoid authorities. Demonstrate that this flight behavior suggests a possible intent to not face the consequences of their actions, making them a flight risk if granted bail. 4. Probability of repetition of offense: Argue that the accused has shown a propensity for violence and a clear intent to harm the victim, as well as any potential witnesses. This poses a significant risk to public safety if the accused were to be released on bail, as there is a possibility of repeating the offense or engaging in further retaliatory behavior. 5. Lack of remorse or willingness to comply: If available, emphasize any indicators that the accused has shown a lack of remorse for their actions or a demonstrated unwillingness to comply with the law. This could include prior criminal history or previous instances of failing to appear in court, as these factors suggest the likelihood of noncompliance with any bail conditions set. By emphasizing these key points, you can argue convincingly that the accused represents a significant threat to public safety and should not be granted bail. However, it is important to consult a legal professional or appropriate authority in your jurisdiction for accurate advice on how to present these arguments effectively."},{"prompt":"translate the following japanse script to english:\\"Miki(girl): Yeah.

Here, just place your hand gently on my belly.” (I hesitantly place my hand on Natsuki’s belly, feeling the gentle movements of her unborn triplets.) MC: (amazed) “Wow, Natsuki. This is incredible. I can actually feel them moving. They’re so active and full of energy.” Natsuki: (smiling warmly) “I’m glad you can experience it too, MC. It’s one of the greatest joys of being a mother, feeling their little kicks and knowing they’re growing healthy and strong.” MC: “I can only imagine the love and happiness they bring to you and how much they’ve changed your life for the better. It’s truly magical.” Natsuki: (emotional) “It really is, MC. Before, I never would have imagined myself in this position, but now I can’t imagine my life without them. They’ve given me a purpose, a reason to keep pushing forward even when things get tough.” (Just then, I could hear Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters telepathically communicate with me. They were calling me by a name I’ve never expected - “Uncle MC”.) Daughter 1: “Hey, Uncle MC!” (I was taken aback by the voice of one of Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters.) MC: “Did…did I just hear one of your daughters call me Uncle MC?” Natsuki: (surprised) “Oh! You heard that too? Yeah, they’ve started calling you that recently. I guess they see you as a close friend and someone they can rely on, just like family.” MC: (overwhelmed with emotion) “That means so much to me, Natsuki. To think that your daughters already consider me a part of their family, it’s truly touching. I’ll always be there for them, just like a proud uncle.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “Thank you, MC. I know they’re lucky to have you in their lives. And I’m lucky to have you by my side as well. We’re all in this together, creating a loving and supportive family.” MC: (smiling) “Absolutely, Natsuki. We’re in this together, now and always. I can’t wait to meet your wonderful daughters when they come into this world and be there for every step of their journey.” Natsuki: (grateful) “And I can’t wait for you to be a part of their lives, to share in their joys and milestones. It’s going to be an amazing adventure, and I’m so glad you’re here with us.” (As Natsuki and I continued to feel the gentle movements of her unborn triplet daughters, we embraced the love and unity that surrounded us, knowing that our bond would only grow stronger with time. Even if Natsuki was an angel, I loved her the same.) (That night, we went to the clubroom to see what other sort of supernatural creatures the rest of the girls were.)

That’s interesting. What sort of supernatural creatures are all of you?” Yuri: “Heh. You should see my abilities for yourself.” (Yuri suddenly ran around me at blinding speed. She then returned to her seat - sipping a glass of blood when she sat back down.)","completion":"MC: (astonished) \\"Yuri, what was that?

Your words mean a lot to me.

Additionally, it's best to provide peanuts as a supplement to their natural diet rather than relying on them as the primary food source for squirrels."},{"prompt":"Did there exist a Governor-General in Ming China? What was their responsibilities?","completion":"No, there was no position of Governor-General in Ming China. The Ming dynasty (1368-1644) had a different administrative structure than the Governor-General system that existed during the Qing dynasty (1644-1912). In Ming China, the highest-ranking official below the emperor was the Grand Secretary, who oversaw the central government's administrative affairs. Below the Grand Secretary, the empire was divided into provinces, each governed by a Provincial Governor (Xunfu) or a Chief Military Commissioner (Jiedushi) who had both civil and military responsibilities. These provincial officials were appointed by the central government to exercise control over their respective regions. Provincial Governors were responsible for various administrative tasks, such as tax collection, law enforcement, defense, maintaining civil order, and overseeing local officials. They played a significant role in representing imperial authority and ensuring the smooth functioning of their respective provinces. It should be noted that the Ming dynasty's administrative system had some variations and changes over time, but the position of Governor-General did not exist during that period."},{"prompt":"How was the Ming system different from the Qing system? How was Chinese feudalism different from European feudalism?","completion":"The Ming system differed from the Qing system in several ways: 1. Ethnicity: The Ming dynasty was primarily governed by ethnic Han Chinese, while the Qing dynasty was ruled by the Manchu ethnic minority. The Qing rulers initially maintained a dual administration system, where Manchu officials held higher-ranking positions, while the Chinese officials occupied lower administrative roles. 2. Government Structure: The Ming dynasty had a centralized government with the emperor at the top, assisted by the Grand Secretary and various bureaucracies. The Qing dynasty, on the other hand, adopted a more decentralized system, maintaining some elements of the Ming administration while incorporating traditional Manchu tribal institutions. 3. Military: The Ming dynasty had a military composed of a standing army known as the \\"Weiguo\\" system, with professional soldiers directly under state control. In contrast, the Qing dynasty relied on a system called the Eight Banners, which were mainly composed of Manchu and Mongolian warriors organized into separate military units. 4. Foreign Relations: The Ming dynasty pursued a policy of isolationism and focused on consolidating and maintaining its borders. In contrast, the Qing dynasty expanded its territory significantly and actively engaged in diplomatic relations with foreign powers, including Central Asia, Russia, and European countries. Regarding the difference between Chinese feudalism and European feudalism, there are several key distinctions: 1. Political Structure: Chinese feudalism was characterized by a strong centralized state ruled by an emperor. The emperor held vast powers and controlled the land, appointing local officials. In European feudalism, political power was decentralized, with local lords or nobles holding significant control over their territories. 2. Serfdom vs. Peasantry: European feudalism had a system of serfdom where peasants were tied to the land and owed labor or dues to the lords in exchange for protection. Chinese feudalism, on the other hand, focused more on a peasant-based agricultural society with tenants who paid rents to landowners for the land they cultivated. 3. Religious Influence: Christianity had a considerable influence on European feudalism, with the Church playing a prominent role in legitimizing political power and the divine right of kings. Chinese feudalism, rooted in Confucian ideology, emphasized the moral obligations and duties of rulers and officials. 4. End of Feudalism: Feudalism gradually declined in Europe during the medieval period with the rise of a centralized nation-state system. In China, feudalism persisted to some extent until the late imperial era, though the Ming and Qing dynasties introduced significant changes to the feudal system. It is important to note that while there are similarities in social structures, the development and characteristics of feudalism in Europe and China had distinct historical and cultural contexts."},{"prompt":"What is the similarities and differences between traditional Chinese religions and European religions?","completion":"Traditional Chinese religions and European religions have both similarities and differences. Here are a few: Similarities: 1. Polytheism: Both traditional Chinese religions and some European pagan religions incorporated polytheistic beliefs, meaning they worshipped multiple gods and deities associated with various aspects of life, nature, and natural phenomena. 2. Ancestor Worship: Ancestor veneration was a common feature in both traditional Chinese religions and some European belief systems. Respect and offerings to ancestors played a significant role in honoring and maintaining familial and ancestral connections. 3. Rituals and Offerings: Both traditional Chinese religions and European religions involved rituals and offerings as a way to communicate with the divine, seek blessings, and express devotion. These rituals often included sacred spaces, altars, prayers, and symbolic acts. Differences: 1. Pantheon and Mythology: Chinese religions, such as Daoism, Confucianism, and Chinese folk religion, have their distinct pantheon and mythological traditions, including figures like the Jade Emperor, Guanyin, or the Dragon. European religions had their own separate mythologies and pantheons associated with Greek, Roman, Norse, and Celtic traditions, among others. 2. Religious Texts: China has a rich history of religious texts like the Tao Te Ching in Daoism or various scriptures associated with Buddhism and Confucianism. European religions had their own collection of oral traditions, myths, and sagas, but a unified religious text like the Bible or Quran did not exist across all European traditions. 3. Organized Institutional Structures: European religions, particularly Christianity, developed highly organized and hierarchical institutional structures, such as the Catholic Church, with centralized authority, clergy, and religious orders. Traditional Chinese religions had more flexible structures, with varying degrees of local and regional organization but lacking a single centralized authority. 4. Influence on Sociopolitical Structures: European religions, particularly Christianity, had a significant impact on shaping sociopolitical structures in Europe and played a role in the establishment of monarchies, laws, and governance systems. In contrast, traditional Chinese religions influenced aspects of Chinese society but were typically more integrated with existing sociopolitical systems, such as Confucianism's influence on governance and ethical principles. It is essential to recognize that these generalizations do not capture the entirety of diverse religious practices, beliefs, and traditions across both Chinese and European contexts. Additionally, variations and nuances exist within each religion and region, adding to the complexity and richness of these diverse religious systems."},{"prompt":"What is a tusi in Ming China?","completion":"In Ming China, a tusi (土司) referred to a local ruler or chieftain appointed by the central government to administer non-Han ethnic minority regions, particularly in border areas. The tusi system was a governing structure implemented by the Ming dynasty to manage and control these regions. The tusi were bestowed with authority over their respective territories while still being subject to Ming imperial rule. They were responsible for maintaining local order, collecting taxes, managing regional affairs, and providing military services to the central government when required. The tusi system aimed to integrate minority communities into the Ming state apparatus and ensure stability in the border regions. The Ming dynasty implemented the tusi system to manage various minority groups, including the Miao, Yao, Yi, and others. The appointed tusi rulers often came from local elite families within the respective ethnic groups and were supposed to act as intermediaries between their communities and the central authority. It's important to note that the tusi system had its complexities and variations across different regions and ethnic groups during the Ming dynasty. Some tusi rulers came to hold considerable autonomy and often strengthened their own power at the expense of central control. The system was eventually abolished during the Qing dynasty's reign."},{"prompt":"What does \\"土司\\" mean?","completion":"In Chinese, the term \\"土司\\" (tusi) can be translated as \\"local chieftain\\" or \\"local ruler.\\" The character \\"土\\" (tu) means \\"earth\\" or \\"soil,\\" while \\"司\\" (si) refers to \\"functions\\" or \\"office.\\" Combined, \\"土司\\" denotes the role of a local leader or ruler appointed to govern specific regions, particularly in non-Han ethnic minority areas."},{"prompt":"What was the European equivalent to the Tusi?","completion":"There is no direct equivalent to the tusi system in European history. The tusi system was a specific governing structure implemented in Ming China to administer non-Han ethnic minority regions. It involved the appointment and control of local rulers or chieftains by the central authority. In Europe, various forms of governance were in place during different periods and regions. Feudalism, for example, was a decentralized system where local lords held authority over specific territories. However, feudalism in Europe did not involve the direct appointment of rulers by a centralized authority in the same manner as the tusi system. European colonialism also saw the establishment of colonies and territories governed by representatives appointed by European powers. While these colonial structures shared some similarities with the appointment of local rulers, they were not the same as the tusi system. The governance structures and relationships between colonizers and local populations in European colonial contexts were complex and varied. It is important to understand that historical governance systems differed across regions and eras, making it challenging to find an exact equivalent to the tusi system in European history."},{"prompt":"(In Natsuki’s room…) Natsuki: (cleaning her halo) “Come on…get clean already…” (Eventually, I [MC] enter the room.)

The car pulls up to a stoplight, and the Young Man drums his fingers on the steering wheel, his mind seemingly elsewhere. PLAYER Yeah, I get it. Everyone's always so caught up in their own lives. Sometimes it feels like we're all just living in a giant elevator, passing by without really connecting. YOUNG MAN (nods) Exactly! It’s like we're all just background characters in each other's stories, you know? No one really stops to ask, \\"Hey, what's your story?\\" or even, \\"How's your day going?\\" Player looks at the Young Man with newfound interest, sensing a hidden story behind his tired eyes. PLAYER Well, I'm asking. How's your day been, Mr. Mysterious Muscle Car-owner? YOUNG MAN (laughs) Call me Alex. And honestly, my day's been the same as always. Getting through the motions, trying to find the spark amidst the monotony. I dream of a life where every day is an adventure, not just commuting between work and home. The traffic light turns green, and Alex steps on the gas, speeding away from the intersection. PLAYER I get what you mean. Maybe it's time for a change. Do something to break free from the monotony. A glimmer of hope dances in Alex's tired eyes, as if the Player's words ignite a small flame within him. YOUNG MAN You might be onto something there. Maybe it's time to shake things up, find an adventure beyond the mundane. As Alex expertly maneuvers through the bustling city traffic, the friendly chatter continues, slowly revealing layers of their personalities and dreams."},{"prompt":"(In Natsuki’s room…) Natsuki: (cleaning her halo) “Come on…get clean already…” (Eventually, I [MC] enter the room.) Natsuki: (momentarily flapping her angel wings) “Oh! Hey, MC! How’s it going?” MC: “Hey, Natsuki! I’m doing alright, thanks for asking. What about you? How’s everything going with the halo cleaning?” Natsuki: “Ugh, it’s such a pain. This thing gets dirty way too easily. I’ve been trying different methods, but it just doesn’t want to cooperate. It’s like it’s mocking me or something.” (feeling her unborn triplet daughters kicking) “Oh!” MC: “Whoa, Natsuki! Are you alright? Are you feeling okay?” Natsuki: (rubbing her belly) “Yeah, I’m fine. It’s just my unborn triplet daughters. They’re really active today. They always seem to respond whenever I’m feeling frustrated or stressed.” MC: “That’s amazing! It’s like they can sense your emotions even before they’re born. It must be quite an experience to have them with you all the time.” Natsuki: (smiling) “It definitely is. I never thought I’d be a mother at such a young age, but these little angels have brought so much joy into my life. They remind me to stay positive, even when things are tough. More importantly, they can telepathically communicate with ANYONE - no matter if they’re awake or sleeping!” MC: “Wow, that’s incredible! It must be so special to have such a close connection with them.” Natsuki: “It really is. Sometimes, when I’m feeling down, they’ll send me comforting thoughts or even funny images to make me smile. It’s like having a team of cheerleaders with me at all times. Anyways, would you like to feel them kicking?” MC: “Oh, um, sure! If it’s okay with you.” Natsuki: “Of course, it’s no problem. Here, just place your hand gently on my belly.” (I hesitantly place my hand on Natsuki’s belly, feeling the gentle movements of her unborn triplets.) MC: (amazed) “Wow, Natsuki. This is incredible. I can actually feel them moving. They’re so active and full of energy.” Natsuki: (smiling warmly) “I’m glad you can experience it too, MC. It’s one of the greatest joys of being a mother, feeling their little kicks and knowing they’re growing healthy and strong.” MC: “I can only imagine the love and happiness they bring to you and how much they’ve changed your life for the better. It’s truly magical.” Natsuki: (emotional) “It really is, MC. Before, I never would have imagined myself in this position, but now I can’t imagine my life without them. They’ve given me a purpose, a reason to keep pushing forward even when things get tough.” (Just then, I could hear Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters telepathically communicate with me. They were calling me by a name I’ve never expected - “Uncle MC”.) Daughter 1: “Hey, Uncle MC!” (I was taken aback by the voice of one of Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters.) MC: “Did…did I just hear one of your daughters call me Uncle MC?” Natsuki: (surprised) “Oh! You heard that too? Yeah, they’ve started calling you that recently. I guess they see you as a close friend and someone they can rely on, just like family.” MC: (overwhelmed with emotion) “That means so much to me, Natsuki. To think that your daughters already consider me a part of their family, it’s truly touching. I’ll always be there for them, just like a proud uncle.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “Thank you, MC. I know they’re lucky to have you in their lives. And I’m lucky to have you by my side as well. We’re all in this together, creating a loving and supportive family.” MC: (smiling) “Absolutely, Natsuki. We’re in this together, now and always. I can’t wait to meet your wonderful daughters when they come into this world and be there for every step of their journey.” Natsuki: (grateful) “And I can’t wait for you to be a part of their lives, to share in their joys and milestones. It’s going to be an amazing adventure, and I’m so glad you’re here with us.” (As Natsuki and I continued to feel the gentle movements of her unborn triplet daughters, we embraced the love and unity that surrounded us, knowing that our bond would only grow stronger with time. Even if Natsuki was an angel, I loved her the same.) (That night, we went to the clubroom to see what other sort of supernatural creatures the rest of the girls were.) (At the clubroom, we find Yuri, Sayori, Monika, and a mysterious figure sitting together.) MC: “Hey everyone, what’s going on here?” Monika: “Oh, MC! We were just discussing our own supernatural abilities. It seems we all come from a legacy of supernatural creatures - each one having some sort of founder.” Natsuki: “Yeah, even though I’m an angel, that doesn’t mean the rest of us are supernatural beings.” MC: “Really? That’s interesting. What sort of supernatural creatures are all of you?” Yuri: “Heh. You should see my abilities for yourself.” (Yuri suddenly ran around me at blinding speed. She then returned to her seat - sipping a glass of blood when she sat back down.) MC: (astonished) “Yuri, what was that? How did you move so fast?” Yuri: “I have inherited the traits of a vampire. My supernatural speed and enhanced senses allow me to maneuver quickly and efficiently. And as for the founder of my supernatural clan…”","completion":"Yuri: \\"The founder of my clan was a powerful vampire who sought knowledge and intellectual pursuits.

Your natural leadership skills and dedication to making everyone feel included really mirror the idea of a powerful witch.\\" Natsuki: \\"And finally, there's our mysterious guest here. She's a phoenix.\\" MC: \\"A phoenix? That's incredible! I've heard legends about the mythical phoenix, but I never thought I would meet one.\\" Mysterious Figure: \\"Yes, I am a phoenix, constantly reborn from the ashes. My ancestor was a phoenix who possessed the ability to heal and restore life. I carry on that legacy, using my powers to bring hope and renewal to those around me.\\" MC: \\"That's absolutely fascinating. You all have such incredible abilities that reflect your personalities and passions. I feel honored to be surrounded by such an extraordinary group of individuals.\\" Natsuki: \\"And just like with my angelic abilities, we all have our own unique strengths and powers. Together, we can support and rely on each other, creating an unbreakable bond.\\" Sayori: \\"Absolutely!

Let's embrace our supernatural sides and continue writing our own extraordinary story together.

Шаги для получения предсказания о будущей прибыли на основе предыдущей с использованием AForge.Neuro: 1. Подготовьте данные: Ваш набор данных должен содержать предыдущую прибыль в течение определенного периода времени. Обычно это представлено в виде временного ряда значений. 2. Создайте модель: Создайте архитектуру нейронной сети, используя классы AForge.Neuro. Например, вы можете создать многослойный перцептрон (MLP) с помощью класса \`ActivationNetwork\` и настроить его параметры, такие как количество скрытых слоев, количество нейронов в каждом слое, функцию активации и т. д. 3. Обучите модель: Используйте предоставленные в AForge.Neuro методы для обучения модели на вашем наборе данных. Обычно это выполняется путем многократного предоставления входных данных и ожидаемых выходных значений модели и последующей коррекции весов нейронной сети с помощью метода обратного распространения ошибки. 4. Предсказание: После завершения обучения вы можете использовать обученную модель для предсказания будущей прибыли на основе предыдущей. Передайте предыдущие значения входных данных в модель и получите предсказанные значения выходных данных. Примерный код для реализации предсказания прибыли: \`\`\`csharp // Создание модели ActivationNetwork network = new ActivationNetwork(new SigmoidFunction(), inputSize, hiddenSize, outputSize); // Обучение модели BackPropagationLearning teacher = new BackPropagationLearning(network); teacher.LearningRate = 0.1; teacher.Momentum = 0.0; teacher.Learn(trainingData, maxEpochs); // Предсказание на основе предыдущих данных double[] previousData = GetPreviousData(); double[] prediction = network.Compute(previousData); // Использование предсказания double predictedProfit = prediction[0]; \`\`\` Обратите внимание, что это примерный код, и вам может потребоваться настроить параметры модели и другие аспекты в соответствии с вашей конкретной задачей.

Here, just place your hand gently on my belly.” (I hesitantly place my hand on Natsuki’s belly, feeling the gentle movements of her unborn triplets.) MC: (amazed) “Wow, Natsuki. This is incredible. I can actually feel them moving. They’re so active and full of energy.” Natsuki: (smiling warmly) “I’m glad you can experience it too, MC. It’s one of the greatest joys of being a mother, feeling their little kicks and knowing they’re growing healthy and strong.” MC: “I can only imagine the love and happiness they bring to you and how much they’ve changed your life for the better. It’s truly magical.” Natsuki: (emotional) “It really is, MC. Before, I never would have imagined myself in this position, but now I can’t imagine my life without them. They’ve given me a purpose, a reason to keep pushing forward even when things get tough.” (Just then, I could hear Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters telepathically communicate with me. They were calling me by a name I’ve never expected - “Uncle MC”.) Daughter 1: “Hey, Uncle MC!” (I was taken aback by the voice of one of Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters.) MC: “Did…did I just hear one of your daughters call me Uncle MC?” Natsuki: (surprised) “Oh! You heard that too? Yeah, they’ve started calling you that recently. I guess they see you as a close friend and someone they can rely on, just like family.” MC: (overwhelmed with emotion) “That means so much to me, Natsuki. To think that your daughters already consider me a part of their family, it’s truly touching. I’ll always be there for them, just like a proud uncle.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “Thank you, MC. I know they’re lucky to have you in their lives. And I’m lucky to have you by my side as well. We’re all in this together, creating a loving and supportive family.” MC: (smiling) “Absolutely, Natsuki. We’re in this together, now and always. I can’t wait to meet your wonderful daughters when they come into this world and be there for every step of their journey.” Natsuki: (grateful) “And I can’t wait for you to be a part of their lives, to share in their joys and milestones. It’s going to be an amazing adventure, and I’m so glad you’re here with us.” (As Natsuki and I continued to feel the gentle movements of her unborn triplet daughters, we embraced the love and unity that surrounded us, knowing that our bond would only grow stronger with time. Even if Natsuki was an angel, I loved her the same.) (That night, we went to the clubroom to see what other sort of supernatural creatures the rest of the girls were.) (At the clubroom, we find Yuri, Sayori, Monika, and a mysterious figure sitting together.) MC: “Hey everyone, what’s going on here?” Monika: “Oh, MC! We were just discussing our own supernatural abilities. It seems we all come from a legacy of supernatural creatures - each one having some sort of founder, with their name permanently wedged into our minds ever since we were born.” Natsuki: “Yeah, even though I’m an angel, that doesn’t mean the rest of us are supernatural beings.” MC: “Really? That’s interesting. What sort of supernatural creatures are all of you?” Yuri: “Heh. You should see my abilities for yourself.” (Yuri suddenly ran around me at blinding speed. She then returned to her seat - sipping a glass of blood when she sat back down.) MC: (astonished) “Yuri, what was that? How did you move so fast?” Yuri: “I have inherited the traits of a vampire. My supernatural speed and enhanced senses allow me to maneuver quickly and efficiently. And as for the founder of my supernatural clan…” Sayori: “And I-” Yuri: “LET ME FINISH!” Sayori: (giggling) “Sorry, Yuri. Go ahead.” Yuri: (clears her throat) “The founder of my clan is none other than Vlad Dracula, famously known as Count Dracula.” MC: “Wait, seriously? You’re descended from Count Dracula himself?” Yuri: “Yes, it seems so. I’ve always been drawn to the dark, and I suppose it’s in my blood. Pun intended.” Natsuki: “That’s pretty cool, Yuri. I’ve always found vampires fascinating.” Monika: “Well, Yuri isn’t the only one with supernatural abilities. I come from a lineage of witches. The founder of my clan is none other than the infamous witch, Morgan Le Fay.” MC: “A witch? That’s incredible, Monika! What sort of powers do you have?” Monika: “I have the ability to manipulate and control various elements. Fire, water, earth, and even air. I can harness their power and use it to my advantage.” MC: “Wow, that’s amazing! You must be incredibly powerful.” Monika: “Thank you, MC. It’s definitely a unique gift.” Sayori: “And don’t forget about me, MC! I come from a lineage of fairies. The founder of my clan is Titania, Queen of the Fairies.” MC: “A fairy? That’s so adorable, Sayori!” Sayori: (giggling) “Thank you, MC! Fairies have the power to bring joy and happiness to the world. We have the ability to manipulate emotions and spread positivity wherever we go.” Natsuki: “Aw, Sayori, that suits you perfectly!” MC: “So, what about the mysterious figure sitting with you? Do they have supernatural abilities too?” Monika: “Oh, this is our newest member, Kotonhoa.”","completion":"Kotonhoa: (smiling warmly) \\"Hello, MC. It's nice to meet you.

Eres la inspiración que danza en mi pecho, la melodía que acaricia los acordes de mi vida, eres el sol radiante en mis días llenos de sombras, la fuerza que enaltece mi espíritu, que me anima y motiva. Tus ojos, dos luceros que iluminan mi destino, refugio de ternura, mi faro en el mar tormentoso, en tu sonrisa encuentro la razón de mi existencia, en tus brazos, la seguridad que ansío desde el principio. Qué podría hacer sin ti, musa de mis suspiros, si eres el latido que acompaña mi camino, si en tus besos encuentro la paz y mi refugio, eres la mitad perfecta que en mí siempre ha vivido. En cada letra, en cada verso plasmado, te llevo en mis palabras como un mantra sagrado, pues eres tú quien inspira cada letra que formo, quien enciende la flama y encarna mis anhelos. Has roto las barreras de lo desconocido, has derribado muros en mi corazón herido, has pintado de colores grises cielos oscuros, has llenado de vida mis días más impuros. Qué podría hacer sin ti, mi eterna confidente, los días no tendrían sentido ni razón de ser, en tu amor descubrí la certeza más profunda, eres mi salvavidas en el naufragio más cruento. En cada rincón de mi ser llevas tu esencia, eres el eco que resuena, suave y coherente, que guía mis pasos en cada encrucijada, eres el sol que brilla y en mi horizonte florece. Tus abrazos, refugio donde encuentro plenitud, tus caricias, bálsamo que sana las heridas, eres mi complemento perfecto, mi melodía, mi razón de ser y mi eterna compañía. Qué podría hacer sin ti, fuente de inspiración, si eres el motivo que mueve mi pluma al escribir, eres el fuego que arde en mis versos apasionados, mi confidente en noches de desvelo y de dormir. Eres la poesía que fluye en mis venas, la sinfonía que ilumina el lienzo de mi vida, me has enseñado que el amor no tiene límites, que en esta danza eterna, junto a ti, soy vivida. Qué podría hacer sin ti, mi amor incondicional, si eres la razón por la que mi corazón late, cada mañana despierto agradecido por tu existencia, a tu lado, descubrí el significado de amar de verdad. En las noches en vela, en la calma del amanecer, reflexiono sobre nuestros sueños y nuestro ser, y encuentro la respuesta que tanto anhelo, que sin ti, mi amor, no sé qué podría hacer. Por eso, en cada verso, en cada suspiro, te expreso mi amor con la pluma en el papel, porque sin ti, mi amada, no existe vida eterna, eres el faro que guía mi camino hacia el amanecer. En cada palabra escrita, te abrazo con el alma, y en el eco de las letras se inspira mi corazón, porque sin ti, mi amor, no habría poesía sin límites, eres la musa que enciende mi inspiración. Qué podría hacer sin ti, pregunta sin respuesta, porque a tu lado, mi amada, he encontrado la verdad, contigo, cada día es una nueva aventura, y en tu amor inmenso, mi vida reencontré la felicidad."},{"prompt":"(In Natsuki’s room…) Natsuki: (cleaning her halo) “Come on…get clean already…” (Eventually, I [MC] enter the room.)

In ancient Rome, sin was primarily seen as a transgression against the gods and the moral order of society. The Romans believed in a pantheon of gods and goddesses who controlled various aspects of life, and they attributed a great deal of importance to maintaining the favor of these deities. Thus, committing a sinful act was seen as an offense against these gods and their divine laws. The Romans had a concept of piety called \\"pietas,\\" which involved fulfilling one's responsibilities and obligations to the gods, family, and state. Failing in these duties or violating moral norms was considered sinful and could result in divine punishment. However, Roman views on sin were not as concerned with internal moral guilt as later Christian views would be. Instead, sin was more closely associated with actions that disrupted social harmony or went against established religious practices. For example, lying, stealing, or committing adultery were seen as sins because they violated the established social and moral norms. Roman religious rituals and offerings were seen as a way to atone for sins and seek forgiveness from the gods. For more serious transgressions, additional rituals and sacrifices were often required to appease the offended deity. It is important to note that Roman views on sin were not uniform throughout society, as religious beliefs and practices varied across different regions and social classes. Additionally, over time, Roman religious beliefs and practices evolved and changed, particularly with the influence of Christianity in the later Roman Empire, which introduced new ideas and perspectives on sin."},{"prompt":"What were the ancient Greek views on sin?","completion":"The ancient Greek views on sin were different from the Roman perspectives, as Greek religion and philosophy had distinct concepts and interpretations. In ancient Greece, sin, or hamartia, was often understood as a tragic flaw or error in judgment that led to disastrous consequences. This concept was particularly prevalent in Greek tragedy, where the protagonists often displayed hubris, excessive pride or arrogance, which ultimately brought about their downfall. These tragic figures were seen as responsible for their actions and suffered the consequences due to their own flaws. Greek religion was polytheistic, and the gods were believed to be immortal and powerful beings, but they were not universally just or omniscient. The Greek gods were seen as having their own psychological motivations and fallible traits, which could sometimes lead to immoral behavior. Despite this, the gods were still associated with moral norms, and humans were expected to adhere to these standards. Like the Romans, the Greeks had a strong emphasis on maintaining harmony and order in society. Acting against established social norms, disrupting the natural order, or behaving in a manner that offended the gods was seen as sinful. However, the Greek understanding of sin was not as reliant on divine punishment or eternal damnation as seen in some other traditions. The Greeks also valued moderation and the pursuit of virtue, with the ancient philosophers playing a significant role in shaping ideas about sin and moral conduct. Philosophers such as Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle explored notions of virtuous behavior, ethical principles, and self-examination, emphasizing the cultivation of an individual's moral character. In Greek religious practices, rituals and sacrifices were performed to appease the gods and seek their favor. However, the emphasis was more on maintaining a harmonious relationship with the gods rather than seeking forgiveness for specific sins. Overall, the ancient Greek views on sin were centered around the concepts of tragedy, moral character, and maintaining harmony in society, with a focus on personal responsibility and the pursuit of virtue."},{"prompt":"Can you condense your previous response to just a few paragraphs?","completion":"Certainly! Here is a condensed version: The ancient Greeks had a different view of sin compared to the Romans. In Greek religion and philosophy, sin, or hamartia, was often seen as a tragic flaw or error in judgment that led to disastrous consequences. The Greeks believed that individuals were responsible for their actions and suffered the consequences due to their own flaws, such as excessive pride or arrogance (hubris). Greek religion was polytheistic, and while gods were seen as powerful beings, they were not universally just or omniscient. The gods had their own psychological motivations and fallible traits, and humans were expected to adhere to moral norms associated with them. Acting against social norms, disrupting the natural order, or behaving in a way that offended the gods was seen as sinful. The Greeks valued harmony, moderation, and the pursuit of virtue. Philosophers like Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle emphasized the cultivation of an individual's moral character and explored ethical principles. Rituals and sacrifices were performed to maintain a positive relationship with the gods, but the focus was more on harmony and favor rather than seeking forgiveness for specific sins. In summary, the ancient Greek views on sin emphasized personal responsibility, tragic flaws as causes of misfortune, adherence to moral norms associated with gods, and the pursuit of virtue and harmony in society."},{"prompt":"What were the ancient Jews views on sin during what I will call the polytheistic period (when the Jews worshipped multiple gods and deities with YHWH being a worshipped by a small cult. This would have been sometime after the Bronze Age but before the reign of Josiah, who implemented reforms that made YHWH the national god of Judah)?","completion":"During the period when the ancient Jews were influenced by polytheistic beliefs and worshipped multiple gods, their views on sin were likely influenced by the broader Canaanite religious practices of the time. However, it's important to note that the specific details of Jewish views on sin during this period are not extensively documented or well-known. Based on archaeological and historical evidence, it is believed that during this era, the Jewish people engaged in syncretism, combining elements of their own religious traditions with the cultic practices of the Canaanite and neighboring cultures. Elements of worship to various gods and goddesses, including YHWH, were likely present. Sin was probably perceived as violating particular religious customs, breaking ritual or moral codes, or provoking the gods' anger. However, it's challenging to provide a comprehensive understanding of Jewish views on sin during this period because many of the religious practices and beliefs of this time have not been fully preserved or clearly documented. The available historical records, such as the Hebrew Bible, were written down or compiled centuries later and often reflect the religious developments and reforms that occurred during and after the reign of Josiah. It was during the reign of King Josiah in the late 7th century BCE that a significant religious reform took place in Judah, leading to the centralization of worship around the deity YHWH. This reform sought to eliminate worship of other gods and establish monotheistic worship of YHWH as the national deity. The subsequent religious texts and teachings that emerged after this period, including the Torah, would significantly shape Jewish views on sin in later centuries. In summary, during the polytheistic period when the ancient Jews worshipped multiple gods, their views on sin were likely influenced by the broader Canaanite religious practices. However, specific details about their beliefs and practices are less known due to the limited documentation from that time. The religious reforms and mindset that followed during and after Josiah's reign would later deeply shape Jewish views on sin."},{"prompt":"So what were the Canaanite views on sin?","completion":"The Canaanites, a polytheistic society inhabiting the ancient Near East, had their own religious beliefs and practices that influenced their views on sin. Canaanite religion centered around a pantheon of gods and goddesses who were believed to control various aspects of nature and human life. The Canaanites considered maintaining harmony and favorable relationships with these deities essential for the well-being of their society. In Canaanite beliefs, sin was primarily understood as a violation of established religious laws or customs rather than an internal moral guilt. Sinful acts were seen as offenses against the gods and their divine order, disrupting the balance of the natural and social world. These acts included practices such as idolatry, engaging in illicit sexual behaviors, practicing sorcery or divination, or neglecting specific rituals and offerings. Canaanite religious rituals and sacrifices were performed to appease the gods and seek their favor. These acts sought to cleanse or purify individuals or the community from sin and restore harmonious relations with the deities. Blood sacrifices, including offerings of animals or crops, were commonly practiced to seek forgiveness and blessing from the gods. It's worth noting that our understanding of Canaanite views on sin is partially derived from the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament), which often portrays the Canaanites as engaging in practices considered sinful from a later Israelite perspective. However, it is essential to keep in mind that this portrayal may reflect the distinct religious and cultural context of the Israelites rather than a fully unbiased perspective on Canaanite beliefs. In summary, the Canaanite views on sin revolved around the violation of religious laws and customs, seen as a disruption of the divine order in relation to the gods. Religious rituals and sacrifices were performed to seek forgiveness and restore harmony with the deities. Our understanding of these doctrines is primarily derived from secondary sources, including the Hebrew Bible, which may present a biased perspective."},{"prompt":"What did the ancient Greeks think about the beginning and end of the world? Did the ancient Greeks believe the world would last forever? Did they believe that the Olympians would some day be overthrown and someone would rule over them? What about foreign gods? What did the ancient Greeks think of the gods of the Near East, Persia, Anatolia, or even Rome?","completion":"The ancient Greeks had various beliefs and myths regarding the beginning and end of the world, along with their perceptions of other gods and foreign cultures. Regarding the origin of the world, Greek mythology presented a range of creation stories. One popular belief was that the world began with the primordial deities, such as Chaos, Gaia (Earth), and Uranus (Heaven). The Olympian gods, including Zeus and his siblings, later came to power after a divine struggle and established their rule over the cosmos. As for the end of the world, Greek mythology did not have a consistent concept of a definitive cataclysmic event or apocalypse. However, they did have myths of periodic destruction and rebirth, such as the concept of the Ages of Man, where humanity and the world would gradually decline and regenerate over time. Regarding the Olympian gods, the ancient Greeks generally believed in their eternal existence and power. However, there were some variations of myths that suggested the possibility of a future conflict or dethronement of the Olympians. For example, the myth of the Titanomachy described a struggle between the Titans and the Olympians, which ended with the Olympians' victory and their becoming the ruling gods. Though these myths hinted at potential challenges to their rule, the majority of Greek beliefs portrayed the Olympians as supreme deities. In terms of foreign gods, the ancient Greeks were exposed to and aware of various deities from neighboring cultures, such as the Near East, Persia, Anatolia, and Rome. There was a degree of syncretism and exchange of religious practices between cultures, as ancient Greeks engaged in trade, colonization, and interactions with different civilizations. The Greeks sometimes assimilated and incorporated foreign deities into their own pantheon, considering them as different aspects or regional variations of their own gods. However, they also maintained a degree of distinctiveness between their gods and foreign divinities. The attitudes toward foreign gods varied, ranging from acceptance and adoption to skepticism or viewing them as barbaric or exotic. Overall, the ancient Greeks held diverse beliefs about the beginning and end of the world, with variations in their perceptions of the Olympian gods and their attitudes toward foreign deities from other cultures. Their views were shaped by a combination of mythology, local traditions, and cultural encounters with different civilizations throughout the ancient Mediterranean."},{"prompt":"Why did the ancient Greeks have a concept of an apocalyptic final battle between god and evil like in Zoroastrianism?","completion":"The ancient Greeks and Zoroastrians both developed their religious beliefs independently of each other, and it's important to note that direct influence is not well-documented or established between the two. However, it is possible to identify some common patterns and cultural influences that may have contributed to the Greeks incorporating a concept of a final battle between god and evil. One factor that might have played a role is the cultural exchange and contact between different civilizations in the ancient Near East. The Greeks had interactions with various cultures, including the Persians, who followed Zoroastrianism. Through trade, political relations, and cultural exchange, ideas and concepts might have circulated and influenced different religious beliefs. Additionally, concepts of cosmic struggles and ultimate battles between divine forces and evil were not exclusive to Zoroastrianism. These beliefs can be traced back to much older mythologies and religious traditions in the ancient Near East, including Mesopotamian and Semitic cultures. These ideas were likely part of the broader cultural and religious milieu of the region that the Greeks were exposed to. Furthermore, the Greeks had their own mythological narratives and themes of divine conflicts and cosmic battles, primarily reflected in their Titanomachy and Gigantomachy myths. These narratives may have provided a framework for conceptualizing a final battle between gods and evil forces, as they featured struggles and wars among divine beings. It's important to remember that religious beliefs evolved and developed over time, and early Greek mythology may have undergone shifts and adaptations based on external influences and cultural interactions. However, due to a lack of extensive evidence, it is challenging to pinpoint specific reasons for the development of the Greek concept of an apocalyptic final battle."},{"prompt":"What was the earliest known religion to have a dualist cosmology between good and evil?","completion":"The earliest known religion with a dualistic cosmology between good and evil is the ancient Persian religion known as Zoroastrianism or Mazdayasna. Zoroastrianism was founded by the prophet Zoroaster (or Zarathustra) in the 6th or 7th century BCE in what is now modern-day Iran. Zoroastrianism presents a distinct dualistic worldview with the main deity, Ahura Mazda, representing the forces of good and truth, and Angra Mainyu (or Ahriman) representing the forces of evil and falsehood. Zoroaster taught that these two opposing forces were engaged in an eternal cosmic struggle, with the ultimate goal of triumphing over evil and restoring order and righteousness in the world. In Zoroastrian cosmology, the universe is seen as a battleground for these conflicting forces. Human beings are believed to have the power to choose between good and evil, and their actions are believed to have an impact on the outcome of the cosmic struggle. Zoroastrianism's dualistic worldview influenced later religious traditions, including elements of Jewish and Christian thought. Concepts such as the existence of a devil or Satan, the idea of a final judgment, and the duality between good and evil can be traced back to Zoroastrian beliefs. It is important to note that while Zoroastrianism represents one of the earliest documented religions with a dualistic cosmology, it is difficult to determine definitively if it was the earliest. This is due to limitations in our knowledge of other ancient religious systems, as well as the lack of preserved texts or historical records from certain periods."},{"prompt":"Why did religions in East Asia (China, Korea, Japan, etc.) not have a concept of a supreme divine king of the universe like in Europe?","completion":"The absence of a concept of a supreme divine king of the universe in East Asian religions, such as in China, Korea, and Japan, can be attributed to several factors: 1. Different cultural and philosophical foundations: East Asian religions, particularly those influenced by Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism, were shaped by distinct cultural and philosophical traditions. These traditions emphasized more immanent and harmonious views of the universe, focusing on interconnectedness, cosmic balance, and individual spiritual development. The emphasis was not on a singular divine ruler but on personal cultivation, social harmony, and understanding the natural order. 2. Emphasis on ancestor worship and ancestral spirits: Ancestor worship played a significant role in East Asian religious beliefs. Ancestors were revered as guardians and protectors of the family and community. The focus was on honoring and maintaining a relationship with ancestral spirits rather than a single divine ruler. This practice in East Asian religions highlighted the importance of lineage, continuity, and familial relationships. 3. Concept of a celestial ruler: While there might not be a prominent idea of a supreme divine king ruling the entire universe in East Asian religions, there is a concept of celestial rulers or gods who preside over specific realms or aspects of the cosmos. For example, in Chinese mythology, there is the Jade Emperor, who is the supreme deity in heaven, but his dominion is not extended to the entirety of the universe. These celestial figures often coexist with other deities, spirits, and forces in a more decentralized and polytheistic framework. 4. Influence of political structures and cultural values: The absence of a concept of a supreme divine king of the universe can also be attributed to the different historical, political, and cultural contexts of East Asian societies. Monarchical systems in Europe were more centralized and often connected to the divine right of kings, with rulers themselves considered as representatives of the divine. In contrast, East Asian societies had different forms of governance, such as imperial systems or shared power structures, which did not necessarily create a religious concept of a central divine ruler. It's important to note that these are general observations, and East Asian religions encompass diverse beliefs and practices that can vary between different regions and time periods."},{"prompt":"What were the major differences between the Abrahamic God and the Jade Emperor?","completion":"The Abrahamic God and the Jade Emperor represent the divine figures in two distinct religious traditions, Christianity (which encompasses Judaism and Islam) and Chinese mythology, respectively. Here are some major differences between the two: 1. Monotheism vs. Polytheism: The Abrahamic God is a singular, transcendent, and absolute deity, worshipped as the one true God in monotheistic traditions. In contrast, the Jade Emperor is a deity among a pantheon of celestial figures in Chinese mythology. Chinese mythology and religious beliefs often incorporate polytheistic elements, with multiple gods and spirits. 2. Doctrines and Holy Books: The Abrahamic God is associated with specific religious doctrines and holy books such as the Bible (Old Testament and New Testament in Christianity) or the Quran in Islam. These scriptures contain stories, laws, and teachings considered divinely inspired. The Jade Emperor, on the other hand, is part of Chinese folklore and mythology rather than a central figure in formalized religious doctrines or texts. 3. Creator vs. Ruler: The Abrahamic God is often understood as the creator of the universe, with attributes such as being all-knowing, all-powerful, and present everywhere. The Abrahamic God is believed to actively intervene in the world and human affairs. In Chinese mythology, the Jade Emperor, also called Yuhuang Dadi, is seen more as a ruler of the heavens and a divinity associated with governance and justice rather than a creator figure. 4. Role in Salvation and Afterlife: In Abrahamic religions, the concept of salvation, judgment, and the afterlife plays a crucial role. The Abrahamic God is seen as the ultimate judge, determining the eternal fate of individuals based on their actions and faith. In Chinese mythology, the Jade Emperor's role is more tied to administrative and celestial affairs rather than personal salvation or judgment.

It’s like they can sense your emotions even before they’re born. It must be quite an experience to have them with you all the time.” Natsuki: (smiling) “It definitely is. I never thought I’d be a mother at such a young age, but these little angels have brought so much joy into my life. They remind me to stay positive, even when things are tough.

Do they have supernatural abilities too?” Monika: “Oh, this is our newest member, Kotonhoa.” Kotonhoa: (smiling warmly) “Hello, MC. It’s nice to meet you. I come from a lineage of shape-shifters. Our founder, Anansi, was a trickster spider known for his ability to change forms.” MC: “That’s fascinating, Kotonhoa! So, you can transform into different things?” Kotonhoa: “Indeed! I can take on the appearance of any living creature, be it animals or even humans. It’s quite handy for blending into different situations or keeping a low profile.” Natsuki: “That’s really cool, Kotonhoa! Shape-shifting must give you so much flexibility and adaptability.” Kotonhoa: “Thank you, Natsuki. It does grant me a certain level of versatility. And being able to experience the world from various perspectives is truly enriching.” Sayori: “That sounds like so much fun, Kotonhoa!

Natsuki: (momentarily flapping her angel wings) “Oh! Hey, MC! How’s it going?” MC: “Hey, Natsuki! I’m doing alright, thanks for asking. What about you? How’s everything going with the halo cleaning?” Natsuki: “Ugh, it’s such a pain. This thing gets dirty way too easily. I’ve been trying different methods, but it just doesn’t want to cooperate. It’s like it’s mocking me or something.” (feeling her unborn triplet daughters kicking) “Oh!” MC: “Whoa, Natsuki! Are you alright? Are you feeling okay?” Natsuki: (rubbing her belly) “Yeah, I’m fine. It’s just my unborn triplet daughters. They’re really active today. They always seem to respond whenever I’m feeling frustrated or stressed.” MC: “That’s amazing! It’s like they can sense your emotions even before they’re born. It must be quite an experience to have them with you all the time.” Natsuki: (smiling) “It definitely is. I never thought I’d be a mother at such a young age, but these little angels have brought so much joy into my life. They remind me to stay positive, even when things are tough. More importantly, they can telepathically communicate with ANYONE - no matter if they’re awake or sleeping!” MC: “Wow, that’s incredible! It must be so special to have such a close connection with them.” Natsuki: “It really is. Sometimes, when I’m feeling down, they’ll send me comforting thoughts or even funny images to make me smile. It’s like having a team of cheerleaders with me at all times. Anyways, would you like to feel them kicking?” MC: “Oh, um, sure! If it’s okay with you.” Natsuki: “Of course, it’s no problem. Here, just place your hand gently on my belly.” (I hesitantly place my hand on Natsuki’s belly, feeling the gentle movements of her unborn triplets.) MC: (amazed) “Wow, Natsuki. This is incredible. I can actually feel them moving. They’re so active and full of energy.” Natsuki: (smiling warmly) “I’m glad you can experience it too, MC. It’s one of the greatest joys of being a mother, feeling their little kicks and knowing they’re growing healthy and strong.” MC: “I can only imagine the love and happiness they bring to you and how much they’ve changed your life for the better. It’s truly magical.” Natsuki: (emotional) “It really is, MC. Before, I never would have imagined myself in this position, but now I can’t imagine my life without them. They’ve given me a purpose, a reason to keep pushing forward even when things get tough.” (Just then, I could hear Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters telepathically communicate with me. They were calling me by a name I’ve never expected - “Uncle MC”.) Daughter 1: “Hey, Uncle MC!” (I was taken aback by the voice of one of Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters.) MC: “Did…did I just hear one of your daughters call me Uncle MC?” Natsuki: (surprised) “Oh! You heard that too? Yeah, they’ve started calling you that recently. I guess they see you as a close friend and someone they can rely on, just like family.” MC: (overwhelmed with emotion) “That means so much to me, Natsuki. To think that your daughters already consider me a part of their family, it’s truly touching. I’ll always be there for them, just like a proud uncle.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “Thank you, MC. I know they’re lucky to have you in their lives. And I’m lucky to have you by my side as well. We’re all in this together, creating a loving and supportive family.” MC: (smiling) “Absolutely, Natsuki. We’re in this together, now and always. I can’t wait to meet your wonderful daughters when they come into this world and be there for every step of their journey.” Natsuki: (grateful) “And I can’t wait for you to be a part of their lives, to share in their joys and milestones. It’s going to be an amazing adventure, and I’m so glad you’re here with us.” (As Natsuki and I continued to feel the gentle movements of her unborn triplet daughters, we embraced the love and unity that surrounded us, knowing that our bond would only grow stronger with time. Even if Natsuki was an angel, I loved her the same.) (That night, we went to the clubroom to see what other sort of supernatural creatures the rest of the girls were.) (At the clubroom, we find Yuri, Sayori, Monika, and a mysterious figure sitting together.) MC: “Hey everyone, what’s going on here?” Monika: “Oh, MC! We were just discussing our own supernatural abilities. It seems we all come from a legacy of supernatural creatures - each one having some sort of founder, with their name permanently wedged into our minds ever since we were born.” Natsuki: “Yeah, even though I’m an angel, that doesn’t mean the rest of us are supernatural beings.” MC: “Really? That’s interesting. What sort of supernatural creatures are all of you?” Yuri: “Heh. You should see my abilities for yourself.” (Yuri suddenly ran around me at blinding speed. She then returned to her seat - sipping a glass of blood when she sat back down.) MC: (astonished) “Yuri, what was that? How did you move so fast?” Yuri: “I have inherited the traits of a vampire. My supernatural speed and enhanced senses allow me to maneuver quickly and efficiently. And as for the founder of my supernatural clan…” Sayori: “And I-” Yuri: “LET ME FINISH!” Sayori: (giggling) “Sorry, Yuri. Go ahead.” Yuri: (clears her throat) “The founder of my clan is none other than Vlad Dracula, famously known as Count Dracula.” MC: “Wait, seriously? You’re descended from Count Dracula himself?” Yuri: “Yes, it seems so. I’ve always been drawn to the dark, and I suppose it’s in my blood. Pun intended.” Natsuki: “That’s pretty cool, Yuri. I’ve always found vampires fascinating.” Monika: “Well, Yuri isn’t the only one with supernatural abilities. I come from a lineage of witches. The founder of my clan is none other than the infamous witch, Morgan Le Fay.” MC: “A witch? That’s incredible, Monika! What sort of powers do you have?” Monika: “I have the ability to manipulate and control various elements. Fire, water, earth, and even air. I can harness their power and use it to my advantage.” MC: “Wow, that’s amazing! You must be incredibly powerful.” Monika: “Thank you, MC. It’s definitely a unique gift.” Sayori: “And don’t forget about me, MC! I come from a lineage of fairies. The founder of my clan is Titania, Queen of the Fairies.” MC: “A fairy? That’s so adorable, Sayori!” Sayori: (giggling) “Thank you, MC! Fairies have the power to bring joy and happiness to the world. We have the ability to manipulate emotions and spread positivity wherever we go.” Natsuki: “Aw, Sayori, that suits you perfectly!” MC: “So, what about the mysterious figure sitting with you? Do they have supernatural abilities too?” Monika: “Oh, this is our newest member, Kotonhoa.” Kotonhoa: (smiling warmly) “Hello, MC. It’s nice to meet you. I come from a lineage of shape-shifters. Our founder, Anansi, was a trickster spider known for his ability to change forms.” MC: “That’s fascinating, Kotonhoa! So, you can transform into different things?” Kotonhoa: “Indeed! I can take on the appearance of any living creature, be it animals or even humans. It’s quite handy for blending into different situations or keeping a low profile.” Natsuki: “That’s really cool, Kotonhoa! Shape-shifting must give you so much flexibility and adaptability.” Kotonhoa: “Thank you, Natsuki. It does grant me a certain level of versatility. And being able to experience the world from various perspectives is truly enriching.” Sayori: “That sounds like so much fun, Kotonhoa! I bet you have many exciting stories to share.” Kotonhoa: “Oh, I definitely do. Perhaps one day, I can regale you all with my tales.” MC: “That would be fantastic, Kotonhoa. We would love to hear about your adventures and the different forms you’ve taken.” Yuri: “Indeed, variety is always intriguing.” Monika: “Absolutely. We all have such unique abilities that make our experiences in this literature club even more extraordinary.” Natsuki: “Yeah, it’s pretty amazing how we’ve all come together with our supernatural backgrounds. It’s like fate brought us here.” Sayori: “Wait, Natsuki. You’ve never told us about the founder of your supernatural clan.” Natsuki: “Oh, you mean one of the archangels?”","completion":"Natsuki: “No, it’s not exactly an archangel... It’s actually someone known as Seraphina, the founder of a lesser-known angelic clan. Seraphina was known for her unwavering loyalty and dedication to righteousness, and it’s through her that I have inherited my angelic powers.” MC: “Wow, Natsuki, that’s incredible! So, what kind of powers do you have?” Natsuki: “Well, as an angel, I have the ability to heal wounds, purify negativity, and spread love and positivity wherever I go. I can also summon and control light energy, which can be used for protection or as a weapon if necessary.” Monika: “That’s amazing, Natsuki. Your powers must be so helpful and comforting to those around you.” Natsuki: “Thank you, Monika. I always try to use my powers for good and to bring happiness to others. It’s a part of who I am, and I wouldn’t trade it for anything.” Yuri: “It’s truly remarkable, Natsuki. Your angelic abilities must be an incredible asset in spreading positivity and hope, especially in times of darkness.” Natsuki: “I hope so, Yuri. I hope that I can make a difference in this world, even if it’s through small acts of kindness.” Sayori: “Natsuki, you’re already making a huge difference in our lives. Your presence alone brightens up the room and brings so much joy to all of us.” Natsuki: (blushing) “Aw, thank you, Sayori. That means a lot to me. I’m glad I can be a source of happiness for all of you.” MC: “You definitely are, Natsuki. Your angelic powers are just an extension of the warmth and kindness you bring to the world. We’re lucky to have you in our lives.” Natsuki: (smiling) “Thank you, MC. I feel the same way about all of you. We may come from different supernatural backgrounds, but we’re all connected by our shared experiences and the bond we’ve formed in this club.” Monika: “Absolutely. Together, we can support each other, embrace our individuality, and create a welcoming and inclusive space for everyone.” Yuri: “Indeed. Our unique abilities and backgrounds make this club even more special, allowing us to learn from one another and grow as individuals.” Sayori: “And most importantly, we can have fun and create beautiful memories together, no matter who or what we are.” (The rest of the club agrees, and we spend the rest of the evening sharing stories, laughter, and a newfound appreciation for the supernatural elements that bring us all together. Through our shared experiences, we find strength, friendship, and a newfound excitement for the future. And as we continue our journey, we know that no matter what kind of supernatural beings we may be, our bond as friends and as a literature club will always remain strong.)"},{"prompt":"Write a immaculately detailed story set in medieval Britain.

He was a rather peculiar individual, often described as a \\"twink\\" due to his slender figure and youthful appearance. However, Tristan possessed a unique talent that set him apart from the rest of the villagers - an uncanny ability to catch fish using his rather unpleasant yet powerful flatulence. One peaceful afternoon, as the sun painted the countryside in golden hues, Tristan found himself longing for a freshly-caught fish dinner. He set out on a quest to find the perfect fishing spot, his wandering feet leading him to a hidden pond amidst the rolling hills. It seemed untouched and untouched by human presence. Feeling excitement bubble within him, Tristan undressed himself down to his undergarments, the gentle breeze brushing against his smooth, fair skin. His twink butt, as you described it, was nothing short of ordinary. Its rounded curves held an air of innocence, untouched by the weight of the world. But it was in no way the focal point of his story. With a playful grin on his face, Tristan waded into the cool, pristine waters, the reflection of the nearby trees dancing on its surface. Waist-deep in the pond, he positioned himself, his face expressing a combination of determination and mischief. And then it happened. A rumbling emanated from Tristan's belly, echoing through the stillness of the pond. His face contorted in concentration before a mighty fart escaped his being, rippling the once tranquil water. A mixture of pride and amusement washed over him as he witnessed the immediate effect of his flatulence, realizing a number of fish succumbing to the odor and floating lifelessly to the surface. \\"Oh, dear fish,\\" Tristan chuckled, pretending to apologize dramatically. \\"Forgive me for my gassy intrusion!\\" His voice carried across the pond, a mischievous twinkle in his eyes as he continued his playful act of repentance. With careful precision, avoiding the lifeless fish, Tristan dipped his slender hand into the water and caught one of the victims of his aromatic trap. It was a beautifully adorned trout, its scales shimmering even in death. Triumphantly, he raised it above his head, admiring its silver sheen. \\"Tonight, my scaly friend, you shall grace my dinner table!\\" Tristan exclaimed with a laugh, the sound echoing through the air. As he made his way back to the village, cradling the trout in his hands, his twinkish face glowed with both satisfaction and anticipation. Tristan knew that, for better or worse, his unique talent provided him with a one-of-a-kind dining experience that no one else could replicate. And so, with a tale of flatulence, fish, and twinkish ingenuity, Tristan left his mark on medieval Britain, forever intertwined with the legends and folklore of the land."},{"prompt":"(In Natsuki’s room…) Natsuki: (cleaning her halo) “Come on…get clean already…” (Eventually, I [MC] enter the room.)

William was known as a twink among the townsfolk, for his delicate features and lean physique. However, he possessed a rather extraordinary talent - a unique ability to catch fish using his exceptionally pungent flatulence. On a lovely summer evening, as the sun began its descent, William felt a familiar craving for fish. With a mischievous grin, he hastily grabbed a sturdy sack from his modest cottage and ventured outside. The fading light danced playfully through the treetops as he made his way towards a secluded pond on the outskirts of the village. Reaching the pond, William glanced around, ensuring he was entirely alone, and his secret skill would remain concealed from prying eyes. Satisfied with the solitude, he undressed, revealing his slender form adorned with loosely fitting clothing that he neatly set aside. His twink butt, pale and toned, took its rightful place as he waded into the water, his skin tingling from the cool embrace of nature. Positioning himself waist-deep in the pond, William's face revealed a mixture of concentration and childish delight. With practiced precision, he let out a mighty fart, directing its potent and aromatic payload into the water below. His usually charming features contorted briefly, as an expression of both effort and amusement, twisted across his face. \\"Oh, dear fishies, prepare yourselves!\\" William exclaimed with a giggle, trying to conceal his excitement. Moments later, the surface of the pond erupted into a near tangible stench, a symphony of foul odors that swirled above the water in a grotesque dance. As the smell engulfed the unsuspecting fish, several of them succumbed to the noxious onslaught, drifting motionless to the surface. With a triumphant chuckle, William carefully collected them, placing them inside his trusty sack. \\"Apologies, my friends, for my terrible manners,\\" William mockingly apologized to the deceased fish, aware that his reputation as the village twink was at stake. He gave a playful wink to the floating fish. Satisfied with his catch, William took a moment to enjoy the tranquil ambiance of the pond. The moon had now risen, casting an ethereal glow upon the water's surface. The twink relished the magical stillness, knowing that these moments of solitude were his escape from the expectations of society. With his sack brimming with fish, William clothed himself once more, concealing the marks of his mischievous endeavor. He returned to his cottage, humming a merry tune, fully aware that his secret talent granted him a taste of satisfaction that no other would ever experience. As he prepared the fish for his dinner, he spoke softly to himself, \\"Ah, William, you truly are a marvel. Who needs a fishing rod when you have the power of your own gas?\\" And so, the twink who possessed this remarkable ability lived his days in medieval Britain, finding joy in the simplicity of his life and always ready to share a tale of his uniquely aromatic fishing adventures."},{"prompt":"Напиши программу на C# которая предсказывает траты на 12 месяцев на основании трат за 3 года","completion":"К сожалению, я не могу написать программу на C# в этом окне чата.

Например, если вы имеете дополнительные данные о доходе, расходах или других параметрах, вы можете использовать их для более точного предсказания трат. Вот пример программы на C#, которая использует линейную регрессию для предсказания трат на основе входных данных: \`\`\`csharp using System; using Accord.MachineLearning.VectorMachines; using Accord.MachineLearning.VectorMachines.Learning; using Accord.Statistics.Kernels; class Program { static void Main(string[] args) { // Входные данные (траты и дополнительные параметры) double[][] inputs = { new double[] { 1000, 5000, 800 }, // Добавьте другие параметры для каждого периода времени // Например, доход, возраст, количество членов семьи и т.д. }; // Траты за 3 года double[] outputs = { 1000, 1200, 1500, 900, 1100, 1000, 1300, 1400, 1600, 1200, 1500, 1000 }; // Создание и обучение линейной регрессии var teacher = new SupportVectorMachineLearning<Gaussian>(inputs: 3); SupportVectorMachine<Gaussian> svm = teacher.Learn(inputs, outputs); // Предсказание трат на основе новых данных double[] predictedExpenses = svm.Decide(inputs); // Вывод предсказанных трат Console.WriteLine(\\"Предсказанные траты на 12 месяцев:\\"); for (int i = 0; i < predictedExpenses.Length; i++) { Console.WriteLine(\\"Месяц {i + 1}: {predictedExpenses[i]}\\"); } } } \`\`\` В этом примере мы используем библиотеку Accord.NET для создания и обучения линейной регрессионной модели. Мы создаем массив \`inputs\`, содержащий дополнительные параметры (например, доход, возраст, количество членов семьи и т.д.) для каждого периода времени, и массив \`outputs\`, содержащий фактические траты за 3 года. Затем мы создаем и обучаем модель с использованием метода линейной регрессии. После обучения мы можем использовать эту модель для предсказания трат на основе новых данных с помощью метода \`Decide\`. Обратите внимание, что этот пример является лишь иллюстрацией того, как использовать линейную регрессию для предсказания трат. Для более точного предсказания вам может потребоваться больше данных и изучение более сложных моделей машинного обучения."},{"prompt":"(In Natsuki’s room…) Natsuki: (cleaning her halo) “Come on…get clean already…” (Eventually, I [MC] enter the room.) Natsuki: (momentarily flapping her angel wings) “Oh! Hey, MC! How’s it going?” MC: “Hey, Natsuki! I’m doing alright, thanks for asking. What about you? How’s everything going with the halo cleaning?” Natsuki: “Ugh, it’s such a pain. This thing gets dirty way too easily. I’ve been trying different methods, but it just doesn’t want to cooperate. It’s like it’s mocking me or something.” (feeling her unborn triplet daughters kicking) “Oh!” MC: “Whoa, Natsuki! Are you alright? Are you feeling okay?” Natsuki: (rubbing her belly) “Yeah, I’m fine. It’s just my unborn triplet daughters. They’re really active today. They always seem to respond whenever I’m feeling frustrated or stressed.” MC: “That’s amazing! It’s like they can sense your emotions even before they’re born. It must be quite an experience to have them with you all the time.” Natsuki: (smiling) “It definitely is. I never thought I’d be a mother at such a young age, but these little angels have brought so much joy into my life. They remind me to stay positive, even when things are tough. More importantly, they can telepathically communicate with ANYONE - no matter if they’re awake or sleeping!” MC: “Wow, that’s incredible! It must be so special to have such a close connection with them.” Natsuki: “It really is. Sometimes, when I’m feeling down, they’ll send me comforting thoughts or even funny images to make me smile. It’s like having a team of cheerleaders with me at all times. Anyways, would you like to feel them kicking?” MC: “Oh, um, sure! If it’s okay with you.” Natsuki: “Of course, it’s no problem. Here, just place your hand gently on my belly.” (I hesitantly place my hand on Natsuki’s belly, feeling the gentle movements of her unborn triplets.) MC: (amazed) “Wow, Natsuki. This is incredible. I can actually feel them moving. They’re so active and full of energy.” Natsuki: (smiling warmly) “I’m glad you can experience it too, MC. It’s one of the greatest joys of being a mother, feeling their little kicks and knowing they’re growing healthy and strong.” MC: “I can only imagine the love and happiness they bring to you and how much they’ve changed your life for the better. It’s truly magical.” Natsuki: (emotional) “It really is, MC. Before, I never would have imagined myself in this position, but now I can’t imagine my life without them. They’ve given me a purpose, a reason to keep pushing forward even when things get tough.” (Just then, I could hear Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters telepathically communicate with me. They were calling me by a name I’ve never expected - “Uncle MC”.) Daughter 1: “Hey, Uncle MC!” (I was taken aback by the voice of one of Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters.) MC: “Did…did I just hear one of your daughters call me Uncle MC?” Natsuki: (surprised) “Oh! You heard that too? Yeah, they’ve started calling you that recently. I guess they see you as a close friend and someone they can rely on, just like family.” MC: (overwhelmed with emotion) “That means so much to me, Natsuki. To think that your daughters already consider me a part of their family, it’s truly touching. I’ll always be there for them, just like a proud uncle.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “Thank you, MC. I know they’re lucky to have you in their lives. And I’m lucky to have you by my side as well. We’re all in this together, creating a loving and supportive family.” MC: (smiling) “Absolutely, Natsuki. We’re in this together, now and always.

It’s going to be an amazing adventure, and I’m so glad you’re here with us.” (As Natsuki and I continued to feel the gentle movements of her unborn triplet daughters, we embraced the love and unity that surrounded us, knowing that our bond would only grow stronger with time. Even if Natsuki was an angel, I loved her the same.) (That night, we went to the clubroom to see what other sort of supernatural creatures the rest of the girls were.) (At the clubroom, we find Yuri, Sayori, Monika, and a mysterious figure sitting together.) MC: “Hey everyone, what’s going on here?” Monika: “Oh, MC! We were just discussing our own supernatural abilities. It seems we all come from a legacy of supernatural creatures - each one having some sort of founder, with their name permanently wedged into our minds ever since we were born.” Natsuki: “Yeah, even though I’m an angel, that doesn’t mean the rest of us are supernatural beings.” MC: “Really? That’s interesting. What sort of supernatural creatures are all of you?” Yuri: “Heh. You should see my abilities for yourself.” (Yuri suddenly ran around me at blinding speed. She then returned to her seat - sipping a glass of blood when she sat back down.) MC: (astonished) “Yuri, what was that? How did you move so fast?” Yuri: “I have inherited the traits of a vampire. My supernatural speed and enhanced senses allow me to maneuver quickly and efficiently. And as for the founder of my supernatural clan…” Sayori: “And I-” Yuri: “LET ME FINISH!” Sayori: (giggling) “Sorry, Yuri. Go ahead.” Yuri: (clears her throat) “The founder of my clan is none other than Vlad Dracula, famously known as Count Dracula.” MC: “Wait, seriously? You’re descended from Count Dracula himself?” Yuri: “Yes, it seems so. I’ve always been drawn to the dark, and I suppose it’s in my blood. Pun intended.” Natsuki: “That’s pretty cool, Yuri. I’ve always found vampires fascinating.” Monika: “Well, Yuri isn’t the only one with supernatural abilities. I come from a lineage of witches. The founder of my clan is none other than the infamous witch, Morgan Le Fay.” MC: “A witch? That’s incredible, Monika! What sort of powers do you have?” Monika: “I have the ability to manipulate and control various elements. Fire, water, earth, and even air. I can harness their power and use it to my advantage.” MC: “Wow, that’s amazing! You must be incredibly powerful.” Monika: “Thank you, MC. It’s definitely a unique gift.” Sayori: “And don’t forget about me, MC! I come from a lineage of fairies. The founder of my clan is Titania, Queen of the Fairies.” MC: “A fairy? That’s so adorable, Sayori!” Sayori: (giggling) “Thank you, MC! Fairies have the power to bring joy and happiness to the world. We have the ability to manipulate emotions and spread positivity wherever we go.” Natsuki: “Aw, Sayori, that suits you perfectly!” MC: “So, what about the mysterious figure sitting with you? Do they have supernatural abilities too?” Monika: “Oh, this is our newest member, Kotonhoa.” Kotonhoa: (smiling warmly) “Hello, MC. It’s nice to meet you. I come from a lineage of shape-shifters. Our founder, Anansi, was a trickster spider known for his ability to change forms.” MC: “That’s fascinating, Kotonhoa! So, you can transform into different things?” Kotonhoa: “Indeed! I can take on the appearance of any living creature, be it animals or even humans. It’s quite handy for blending into different situations or keeping a low profile.” Natsuki: “That’s really cool, Kotonhoa! Shape-shifting must give you so much flexibility and adaptability.” Kotonhoa: “Thank you, Natsuki. It does grant me a certain level of versatility. And being able to experience the world from various perspectives is truly enriching.” Sayori: “That sounds like so much fun, Kotonhoa! I bet you have many exciting stories to share.” Kotonhoa: “Oh, I definitely do. Perhaps one day, I can regale you all with my tales.” MC: “That would be fantastic, Kotonhoa. We would love to hear about your adventures and the different forms you’ve taken.” Yuri: “Indeed, variety is always intriguing.” Monika: “Absolutely. We all have such unique abilities that make our experiences in this literature club even more extraordinary.” Natsuki: “Yeah, it’s pretty amazing how we’ve all come together with our supernatural backgrounds. It’s like fate brought us here.” Sayori: “Wait, Natsuki. You’ve never told us about the founder of your supernatural clan.” Natsuki: “Oh, you mean one of the archangels?” Sayori: “Hang on…the founder of your clan was an ARCHANGEL?!”","completion":"Natsuki: (giggling) \\"Yup, that's right!

It is about a twink who loves catching fish using his horrible farts, eating them for dinner. He grabs a sack from his home and goes outside. He finds a pond and undresses (describe his twink butt) and wades into the water waist-deep. Describe his face as he farts into the water, then as he jokingly acts sorry. Several fish die from the stink, and the twink collects them. Add dialogue from the twink throughout the story.","completion":"I apologize, but I won't be able to generate that story for you."},{"prompt":"","completion":"Once upon a time, in the lush and vibrant countryside of medieval Britain, there lived a peculiar young man known as Timothy. Timothy was a twink in the truest sense of the word, with his lithe frame, delicate features, and a mischievous glimmer in his eyes. He possessed a unique talent that set him apart from others – an ability to catch fish using his rather surprising, albeit unpleasant, gift of flatulence. It was a crisp autumn day when Timothy woke up with a craving for a fish supper. He knew exactly what he had to do. With a twinkle in his eye and determination in his heart, he grabbed a sturdy empty sack from his humble cottage and embarked on his rather unconventional fishing adventure. Venturing beyond the village, Timothy found himself at a tranquil pond nestled amidst rolling hills. The surface of the water shimmered in various shades of blue, tempting him with the promise of a delectable bounty. With the warmth of the sun on his back, he began preparing for his gastronomic escapade. Timothy found a secluded spot by the water's edge and paused for a moment to appreciate the beauty of nature surrounding him. The gentle rustling of leaves in the wind, the distant songs of birds, and the vibrant colors of changing foliage created a picturesque setting for his unconventional endeavor. Undressing himself, Timothy's twink butt was exposed to the cool autumn air. It was pale and smooth, the moonlight seeming to dance upon his fair skin. But the true allure of Timothy's persona lay not in his physical appearance, but in the audacious and unexpected prowess hidden within. Wading into the water until it reached his waist, Timothy positioned himself just so, aligning his twink butt with the serene surface below. Closing his eyes, he took a deep breath, preparing to release the gift that lurked within him. And then, with a sudden burst of air, he unleashed a forceful fart into the water. As the rancid stench filled the air and mingled with the sparkling droplets, a few unfortunate fish bobbing near the surface succumbed to the pungent miasma. Their limp bodies floated atop the water, their eyes wide and lifeless. Timothy's face displayed a mix of triumph and amusement as he stared at the piscine casualties of his gustatory whimsy. \\"Ah, another successful catch,\\" chuckled Timothy, his voice betraying his mischief and satisfaction. \\"Fear not, dear fish, for your sacrifice shall not be in vain.\\" Showing a hint of remorse, or perhaps just an attempt at modesty, Timothy jokingly apologized to the deceased aquatic creatures. \\"Forgive me, my finned friends, for the gruesome fate that befell you. Blame my intestines, not my heart. Onward we must go, to fulfill our mutual destiny.\\" With that, Timothy retrieved his sack, carefully collecting the unfortunate fish and placing them inside. He handled them with tenderness and respect, acknowledging their contribution to his peculiar feast. The twink's lips curved into a contented smile as he contemplated the feast that awaited him. Leaving the pond and its aftermath behind, Timothy walked back to his cottage, his sack of fish slung over his shoulder. The sun began its descent, casting a warm glow upon the countryside. With each step, Timothy hummed a merry tune, reveling in his unusual talent and the adventure that each day brought. For in the realm of medieval Britain, even the most unconventional methods could hold a place in the hearts of those daring enough to embrace them. And Timothy, with his twink butt and his uncanny talent, remained an enigmatic figure in the annals of history, forever remembered for his unique love affair with fish and the resonating echoes of his resounding flatulence."},{"prompt":"Are you aware of a game called Arma?","completion":"Yes, I am familiar with the game Arma.

Avec le référence bibliographique.","completion":"Le paiement des frais scolaires est une pratique courante dans de nombreux systèmes éducatifs à travers le monde. Les frais scolaires peuvent couvrir une variété de dépenses, y compris les frais de scolarité, les frais de laboratoire, les frais d'inscription, les frais de matériel, les frais de transport et les frais d'examen. Ces frais sont généralement payés par les parents ou les tuteurs légaux des élèves. Selon une étude menée par l'UNESCO, intitulée \\"Financement de l'éducation pour tous : une approche globale\\", de nombreux pays en développement imposent des frais scolaires aux familles afin de compenser le manque de financement public dans le secteur de l'éducation. Cela peut entraîner une inégalité d'accès à l'éducation, car les familles à faible revenu peuvent avoir du mal à payer ces frais. Une autre étude, publiée dans le Journal of Education Finance, a analysé les effets du paiement des frais scolaires sur la participation à l'éducation en Afrique subsaharienne. Les chercheurs ont constaté que le paiement des frais scolaires peut entraîner une diminution de la participation des enfants à l'école, en particulier pour les familles à faible revenu. Cela peut également avoir un impact négatif sur la qualité de l'éducation, car les écoles peuvent manquer de ressources en raison du faible montant des frais payés. Références bibliographiques : 1.

Destructive Ability: Town Level (Should be overall superior to Cupa who can create town-sized explosions causally, Comparable to Blazette who can burn entire villages just from losing control of their powers) | Multiverse Level+ (Anna acts as a power source to The Nether and governs over it in its entirety stabilizing it from collapsing. She was meant as a replacement for Blazette who battled Herobrine for a decent amount of time before being overpowered.) Speed: Massively Hypersonic (Superior to Cupa who can react to lightning and explosions moving at these speeds) | Infinite (She is comparable to Blazette who was able to traverse The Nether to the Overworld in mere minutes. It should be noted that The Nether is infinite in size as it correlates in size to the Overworld.)

Weaknesses: Generally doesn't fight Versions: Base | Queen Anna","completion":"Analysis: Based on the provided information, Anna Charlotte from the Mobtalker verse is a powerful character with a range of abilities and high intelligence. In her base form, she possesses superhuman physical characteristics, flight, fire manipulation, dimension manipulation, water manipulation, space-time manipulation, regeneration, reality warping, 4th wall awareness, and immunity to soul manipulation. In terms of destructive ability, in her base form, Anna is Town level, surpassing Cupa in power. She has the ability to create town-sized explosions casually. However, as Queen Anna, she has Multiverse level+ destructive power. She stabilizes and governs the Nether, an entire dimension infinite in size, and acts as a power source for it. In terms of speed, Anna in her base form is massively hypersonic, superior to Cupa. However, as Queen Anna, her speed becomes infinite due to her traversal of the infinite size of the Nether in mere minutes. Lifting ability for Anna is Class 1, based on scaling. In terms of striking ability, Anna in her base form is Town level, superior to Cupa. However, as Queen Anna, her striking ability becomes Multiverse level+, because she stabilizes and governs the Nether, an entire dimension infinite in size, similar to Queen Blaze. Anna's durability in her base form is Town level, surpassing Cupa's survivability. However, as Queen Anna, her durability becomes Multiverse level+. She is comparable to Queen Blazette, who tanked hits from Herobrine and casually tank forces around this level while stabilizing the Nether. Anna possesses high stamina and has a range of several kilometers with fireballs. With her space-time manipulation and reality warping abilities, her range extends to the universal level. In terms of intelligence, Anna is described as very high. As a queen, she can run entire villages, control entire dimensions, and manipulate the player and other individuals. Weaknesses specific to Anna are not provided in the information. It is important to note that without concrete feats or specific context, it can be difficult to accurately gauge a character's abilities. Therefore, this analysis is based on the information provided within the context of the Mobtalker verse."},{"prompt":"Напиши 90 комментариев к видео про раздачу игр от Борисова","completion":"1.

Tout d'abord, dans un monde de plus en plus connecté, les clients s'attendent à pouvoir réserver des chambres d'hôtel en ligne, de manière pratique et rapide. Une application web permettrait aux clients de consulter les disponibilités des chambres, de choisir les dates de séjour et de réserver directement, sans avoir à passer par un appel téléphonique ou une visite en personne à l'hôtel. Cela permettrait d'améliorer l'expérience client, en offrant plus de flexibilité et de commodité. Ensuite, une application web de réservation de chambres d'hôtel permettrait également de simplifier le processus de gestion des réservations pour l'hôtel. Au lieu de devoir gérer les réservations par téléphone ou par email, une application web centralisée permettrait aux employés de l'hôtel de consulter rapidement les réservations, de gérer les disponibilités des chambres et d'effectuer des modifications sans avoir à passer par plusieurs systèmes différents. Cela permettrait de gagner du temps et d'améliorer l'efficacité de la gestion des réservations. De plus, une application web de réservation de chambres d'hôtel pourrait également offrir des fonctionnalités supplémentaires, telles que des promotions spéciales, des avis clients et des informations sur les équipements et services de l'hôtel. Cela permettrait d'informer les clients potentiels et de les inciter à réserver directement sur le site de l'hôtel, plutôt que de passer par des agences de voyage en ligne. Enfin, l'étude sur le déploiement d'une application web pour la réservation des chambres dans un hôtel permettrait également d'évaluer les coûts et les avantages potentiels de cette solution. En comparant les coûts de développement et de maintenance de l'application web avec les bénéfices attendus en termes d'amélioration de l'expérience client et d'efficacité opérationnelle, il serait possible de déterminer si cette solution est viable sur le plan financier. En conclusion, l'étude sur le déploiement d'une application web pour la réservation des chambres dans un hôtel est pertinente car elle permettrait d'améliorer l'expérience client, de simplifier la gestion des réservations, d'offrir des fonctionnalités supplémentaires et d'évaluer les coûts et les avantages potentiels de cette solution."},{"prompt":"traduce esto a español. 形状変更 材質変更：SUS→PP M/L変更 常州本州→ ｳｲﾝｶｰ取付部形状変更φ12⇒φ13.5 Ｒｒｸｯｼｮﾝ逃げ追加","completion":"Cambio de forma Cambio de material: SUS → PP Cambio de M/L Changzhou Honshu → Cambio de forma del acoplamiento del soporte del limpiaparabrisas φ12 → φ13.5 Agregado el escape de la amortiguación Rr"},{"prompt":"Tiering: 2-C, likely 2-A Verse: Mobtalker Name: Blazette, Ablaize, Queen Blaze Gender: Female Age: At least 21 (Officially recognized as a full-grown adult, implying she is this age at minimum) Classification: Queen of The Nether, Leader of The Nether Guard Special Abilities: Superhuman Physical Characteristics, Flight, Martial Arts, Fire Manipulation (Blazes are imbued with the very flames that are present in The Nether, as such, they are capable of controlling those flames in the form of attacks such as projectiles), Heat Manipulation (Able to change the heat of any given area she's present in, making it so hot that even water will evaporate upon entering the atmosphere), Pocket Reality Manipulation (Has absolute control over The Nether, being able to change it to her content), Soul Manipulation (Maintains the souls that are present in The Nether, of which also makes up said realm), Non-Physical Interaction, Conceptual Manipulation, Void Manipulation (Capable of fully interacting with and destroying NPCs, whom of which are described as abstractions and beings without physicality), Immortality (1, 3 & 5; Creatures who are relative to The Nether are unable to die, as their ends have been severed and they can only die via being removed by an NPC), Regeneration (At least Low Godly; Every creature in AT-2verse experiences passive regeneration, which is the same power that allowed Ayami to come back from The Nether as nothing but a soul), Fate Manipulation (Blazette is stated by The Author to have caused The Player's death, which she even confirms when she states that she is bored of seeing The Player die over and over), Power Nullification (Nullied The Player's NPC powers and weakened his overall power, making him able to be oneshot by basically any creature she created), 4th Wall Awareness (Addressed the 4th Wall and is completely aware she's a fictional character), Non-Corporeal (Can cast away her physical form and exist as a spirit, a being without physicality) Blazette has resistances to the following abilities: Space-Time Manipulation (Alterations in Space-Time have no effect on NPCS, even outside their own worlds.), Plot Manipulation (While still effected, NPCs can still resist and even defy the changes in a narrative down about beings as powerful as The Author's avatars), Void Manipulation, Conceptual Manipulation (Can survive within The Void, which erases those who enter it and breaks them down on a conceptual level, reducing them down to their fundamental idea), Reality Warping (From beings as powerful as The NPCs) and NPC abilities in general Destructive Ability: Multi-Universe Level (Blazette is the queen of The Nether and as such, she should be relatively comparable to Andr, who not does Andr consider a comparable person, but they even used to work together back in The Overworld, implying they were comparable), likely Multiverse Level+ (Was capable of doing battle with Herobrine, whom of which is equal to The Player.

Natsuki: (momentarily flapping her angel wings) “Oh! Hey, MC! How’s it going?” MC: “Hey, Natsuki! I’m doing alright, thanks for asking. What about you? How’s everything going with the halo cleaning?” Natsuki: “Ugh, it’s such a pain. This thing gets dirty way too easily. I’ve been trying different methods, but it just doesn’t want to cooperate. It’s like it’s mocking me or something.” (feeling her unborn triplet daughters kicking) “Oh!” MC: “Whoa, Natsuki! Are you alright? Are you feeling okay?” Natsuki: (rubbing her belly) “Yeah, I’m fine. It’s just my unborn triplet daughters. They’re really active today. They always seem to respond whenever I’m feeling frustrated or stressed.” MC: “That’s amazing! It’s like they can sense your emotions even before they’re born. It must be quite an experience to have them with you all the time.” Natsuki: (smiling) “It definitely is. I never thought I’d be a mother at such a young age, but these little angels have brought so much joy into my life. They remind me to stay positive, even when things are tough. More importantly, they can telepathically communicate with ANYONE - no matter if they’re awake or sleeping!” MC: “Wow, that’s incredible! It must be so special to have such a close connection with them.” Natsuki: “It really is. Sometimes, when I’m feeling down, they’ll send me comforting thoughts or even funny images to make me smile. It’s like having a team of cheerleaders with me at all times. Anyways, would you like to feel them kicking?” MC: “Oh, um, sure! If it’s okay with you.” Natsuki: “Of course, it’s no problem. Here, just place your hand gently on my belly.” (I hesitantly place my hand on Natsuki’s belly, feeling the gentle movements of her unborn triplets.) MC: (amazed) “Wow, Natsuki. This is incredible. I can actually feel them moving. They’re so active and full of energy.” Natsuki: (smiling warmly) “I’m glad you can experience it too, MC. It’s one of the greatest joys of being a mother, feeling their little kicks and knowing they’re growing healthy and strong.” MC: “I can only imagine the love and happiness they bring to you and how much they’ve changed your life for the better. It’s truly magical.” Natsuki: (emotional) “It really is, MC. Before, I never would have imagined myself in this position, but now I can’t imagine my life without them. They’ve given me a purpose, a reason to keep pushing forward even when things get tough.” (Just then, I could hear Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters telepathically communicate with me. They were calling me by a name I’ve never expected - “Uncle MC”.) Daughter 1: “Hey, Uncle MC!” (I was taken aback by the voice of one of Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters.) MC: “Did…did I just hear one of your daughters call me Uncle MC?” Natsuki: (surprised) “Oh! You heard that too? Yeah, they’ve started calling you that recently. I guess they see you as a close friend and someone they can rely on, just like family.” MC: (overwhelmed with emotion) “That means so much to me, Natsuki. To think that your daughters already consider me a part of their family, it’s truly touching. I’ll always be there for them, just like a proud uncle.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “Thank you, MC. I know they’re lucky to have you in their lives. And I’m lucky to have you by my side as well. We’re all in this together, creating a loving and supportive family.” MC: (smiling) “Absolutely, Natsuki. We’re in this together, now and always. I can’t wait to meet your wonderful daughters when they come into this world and be there for every step of their journey.” Natsuki: (grateful) “And I can’t wait for you to be a part of their lives, to share in their joys and milestones. It’s going to be an amazing adventure, and I’m so glad you’re here with us.” (As Natsuki and I continued to feel the gentle movements of her unborn triplet daughters, we embraced the love and unity that surrounded us, knowing that our bond would only grow stronger with time. Even if Natsuki was an angel, I loved her the same.) (That night, we went to the clubroom to see what other sort of supernatural creatures the rest of the girls were.) (At the clubroom, we find Yuri, Sayori, Monika, and a mysterious figure sitting together.) MC: “Hey everyone, what’s going on here?” Monika: “Oh, MC! We were just discussing our own supernatural abilities. It seems we all come from a legacy of supernatural creatures - each one having some sort of founder, with their name permanently wedged into our minds ever since we were born.” Natsuki: “Yeah, even though I’m an angel, that doesn’t mean the rest of us are supernatural beings.” MC: “Really? That’s interesting. What sort of supernatural creatures are all of you?” Yuri: “Heh. You should see my abilities for yourself.” (Yuri suddenly ran around me at blinding speed. She then returned to her seat - sipping a glass of blood when she sat back down.) MC: (astonished) “Yuri, what was that? How did you move so fast?” Yuri: “I have inherited the traits of a vampire. My supernatural speed and enhanced senses allow me to maneuver quickly and efficiently. And as for the founder of my supernatural clan…” Sayori: “And I-” Yuri: “LET ME FINISH!” Sayori: (giggling) “Sorry, Yuri. Go ahead.” Yuri: (clears her throat) “The founder of my clan is none other than Vlad Dracula, famously known as Count Dracula.” MC: “Wait, seriously? You’re descended from Count Dracula himself?” Yuri: “Yes, it seems so. I’ve always been drawn to the dark, and I suppose it’s in my blood. Pun intended.” Natsuki: “That’s pretty cool, Yuri. I’ve always found vampires fascinating.” Monika: “Well, Yuri isn’t the only one with supernatural abilities. I come from a lineage of witches. The founder of my clan is none other than the infamous witch, Morgan Le Fay.” MC: “A witch? That’s incredible, Monika! What sort of powers do you have?” Monika: “I have the ability to manipulate and control various elements. Fire, water, earth, and even air. I can harness their power and use it to my advantage.” MC: “Wow, that’s amazing! You must be incredibly powerful.” Monika: “Thank you, MC. It’s definitely a unique gift.” Sayori: “And don’t forget about me, MC! I come from a lineage of fairies. The founder of my clan is Titania, Queen of the Fairies.” MC: “A fairy? That’s so adorable, Sayori!” Sayori: (giggling) “Thank you, MC! Fairies have the power to bring joy and happiness to the world. We have the ability to manipulate emotions and spread positivity wherever we go.” Natsuki: “Aw, Sayori, that suits you perfectly!” MC: “So, what about the mysterious figure sitting with you? Do they have supernatural abilities too?” Monika: “Oh, this is our newest member, Kotonhoa.” Kotonhoa: (smiling warmly) “Hello, MC. It’s nice to meet you. I come from a lineage of shape-shifters. Our founder, Anansi, was a trickster spider known for his ability to change forms.” MC: “That’s fascinating, Kotonhoa! So, you can transform into different things?” Kotonhoa: “Indeed! I can take on the appearance of any living creature, be it animals or even humans. It’s quite handy for blending into different situations or keeping a low profile.” Natsuki: “That’s really cool, Kotonhoa! Shape-shifting must give you so much flexibility and adaptability.” Kotonhoa: “Thank you, Natsuki. It does grant me a certain level of versatility. And being able to experience the world from various perspectives is truly enriching.” Sayori: “That sounds like so much fun, Kotonhoa! I bet you have many exciting stories to share.” Kotonhoa: “Oh, I definitely do. Perhaps one day, I can regale you all with my tales.” MC: “That would be fantastic, Kotonhoa. We would love to hear about your adventures and the different forms you’ve taken.” Yuri: “Indeed, variety is always intriguing.” Monika: “Absolutely. We all have such unique abilities that make our experiences in this literature club even more extraordinary.” Natsuki: “Yeah, it’s pretty amazing how we’ve all come together with our supernatural backgrounds. It’s like fate brought us here.” Sayori: “Wait, Natsuki. You’ve never told us about the founder of your supernatural clan.” Natsuki: “Oh, you mean one of the archangels?” Sayori: “Hang on…the founder of your clan was an ARCHANGEL?!” Natsuki: (blushing) “Um, yeah. My clan originates from one of the archangels, specifically Archangel Gabriel.” MC: “Wow, Natsuki. That’s incredible! Archangels are considered powerful and divine beings. What sort of abilities do you have?” Natsuki: “Well, as an angel, I possess the ability to heal wounds and spread positivity. I can also communicate with other celestial beings and have a strong connection with the spiritual realm.” Yuri: “That’s truly remarkable, Natsuki. A healing angel among us, it’s quite fitting.” Monika: “Absolutely, Natsuki. Your ability to bring comfort and uplift others is a gift in itself.” Kotonhoa: “Indeed, Natsuki. Your presence brings a sense of calmness and warmth to the club. It’s like a ray of sunshine.” Sayori: “Aw, Natsuki, that’s so sweet! You truly are an angel both inside and out.” Natsuki: (blushing) “Th-thank you, everyone. Your kind words mean a lot to me.” MC: “Well, it seems like our club is truly filled with extraordinary individuals. We each bring our own unique abilities and backgrounds to create something magical.” Monika: “Yes, MC. And together, we can create a literature club that transcends the ordinary. Our stories and experiences will be unlike anything else.” Yuri: “Exactly. We have the opportunity to explore different worlds, both real and supernatural, through the power of literature.” Sayori: “And no matter what our backgrounds are, we’re all here to support and uplift each other.” Kotonhoa: “Indeed, every member of this club brings something special to the table. It’s a privilege to be a part of such a diverse and talented group.” Natsuki: (smiling) “I couldn’t agree more.

How’s everything going with the halo cleaning?” Natsuki: “Ugh, it’s such a pain. This thing gets dirty way too easily. I’ve been trying different methods, but it just doesn’t want to cooperate. It’s like it’s mocking me or something.” (feeling her unborn triplet daughters kicking) “Oh!” MC: “Whoa, Natsuki! Are you alright? Are you feeling okay?” Natsuki: (rubbing her belly) “Yeah, I’m fine. It’s just my unborn triplet daughters. They’re really active today. They always seem to respond whenever I’m feeling frustrated or stressed.” MC: “That’s amazing! It’s like they can sense your emotions even before they’re born. It must be quite an experience to have them with you all the time.” Natsuki: (smiling) “It definitely is. I never thought I’d be a mother at such a young age, but these little angels have brought so much joy into my life. They remind me to stay positive, even when things are tough. More importantly, they can telepathically communicate with ANYONE - no matter if they’re awake or sleeping!” MC: “Wow, that’s incredible!

I can also communicate with other celestial beings and have a strong connection with the spiritual realm.” Yuri: “That’s truly remarkable, Natsuki. A healing angel among us, it’s quite fitting.” Monika: “Absolutely, Natsuki. Your ability to bring comfort and uplift others is a gift in itself.” Kotonhoa: “Indeed, Natsuki. Your presence brings a sense of calmness and warmth to the club. It’s like a ray of sunshine.” Sayori: “Aw, Natsuki, that’s so sweet! You truly are an angel both inside and out.” Natsuki: (blushing) “Th-thank you, everyone.

What sort of powers do you have?” Monika: “I have the ability to manipulate and control various elements. Fire, water, earth, and even air. I can harness their power and use it to my advantage.” MC: “Wow, that’s amazing! You must be incredibly powerful.” Monika: “Thank you, MC. It’s definitely a unique gift.” Sayori: “And don’t forget about me, MC! I come from a lineage of fairies. The founder of my clan is Titania, Queen of the Fairies.” MC: “A fairy? That’s so adorable, Sayori!” Sayori: (giggling) “Thank you, MC! Fairies have the power to bring joy and happiness to the world. We have the ability to manipulate emotions and spread positivity wherever we go.” Natsuki: “Aw, Sayori, that suits you perfectly!” MC: “So, what about the mysterious figure sitting with you? Do they have supernatural abilities too?” Monika: “Oh, this is our newest member, Kotonhoa.” Kotonhoa: (smiling warmly) “Hello, MC. It’s nice to meet you. I come from a lineage of shape-shifters. Our founder, Anansi, was a trickster spider known for his ability to change forms.” MC: “That’s fascinating, Kotonhoa! So, you can transform into different things?” Kotonhoa: “Indeed! I can take on the appearance of any living creature, be it animals or even humans. It’s quite handy for blending into different situations or keeping a low profile.” Natsuki: “That’s really cool, Kotonhoa! Shape-shifting must give you so much flexibility and adaptability.” Kotonhoa: “Thank you, Natsuki. It does grant me a certain level of versatility. And being able to experience the world from various perspectives is truly enriching.” Sayori: “That sounds like so much fun, Kotonhoa! I bet you have many exciting stories to share.” Kotonhoa: “Oh, I definitely do. Perhaps one day, I can regale you all with my tales.” MC: “That would be fantastic, Kotonhoa. We would love to hear about your adventures and the different forms you’ve taken.” Yuri: “Indeed, variety is always intriguing.” Monika: “Absolutely. We all have such unique abilities that make our experiences in this literature club even more extraordinary.” Natsuki: “Yeah, it’s pretty amazing how we’ve all come together with our supernatural backgrounds. It’s like fate brought us here.” Sayori: “Wait, Natsuki. You’ve never told us about the founder of your supernatural clan.” Natsuki: “Oh, you mean one of the archangels?” Sayori: “Hang on…the founder of your clan was an ARCHANGEL?!” Natsuki: (blushing) “Um, yeah. My clan originates from one of the archangels, specifically Archangel Gabriel.” MC: “Wow, Natsuki. That’s incredible! Archangels are considered powerful and divine beings. What sort of abilities do you have?” Natsuki: “Well, as an angel, I possess the ability to heal wounds and spread positivity. I can also communicate with other celestial beings and have a strong connection with the spiritual realm.” Yuri: “That’s truly remarkable, Natsuki. A healing angel among us, it’s quite fitting.” Monika: “Absolutely, Natsuki. Your ability to bring comfort and uplift others is a gift in itself.” Kotonhoa: “Indeed, Natsuki. Your presence brings a sense of calmness and warmth to the club. It’s like a ray of sunshine.” Sayori: “Aw, Natsuki, that’s so sweet! You truly are an angel both inside and out.” Natsuki: (blushing) “Th-thank you, everyone. Your kind words mean a lot to me.” MC: “Well, it seems like our club is truly filled with extraordinary individuals. We each bring our own unique abilities and backgrounds to create something magical.” Monika: “Yes, MC. And together, we can create a literature club that transcends the ordinary. Our stories and experiences will be unlike anything else.” Yuri: “Exactly. We have the opportunity to explore different worlds, both real and supernatural, through the power of literature.” Sayori: “And no matter what our backgrounds are, we’re all here to support and uplift each other.” Kotonhoa: “Indeed, every member of this club brings something special to the table. It’s a privilege to be a part of such a diverse and talented group.” Natsuki: (smiling) “I couldn’t agree more. Our differences make us stronger, and our shared love for literature binds us together.” MC: “Well said, Natsuki. Our club is truly a place where we can embrace our supernatural abilities, explore different worlds through literature, and form unbreakable bonds.” (As we continue our discussion, the club is filled with excitement and anticipation for the countless adventures and stories that await us. Together, we embark on a journey of literature, friendship, and the supernatural, creating a club like no other. Just then, I received an urgent message from my home planet - it was about one of the female aliens.)","completion":"(Female Alien voice): \\"MC, we need your help.

Good luck on your mission.\\" (With a heavy heart, MC leaves the clubroom and makes preparations to return to his home planet. Little did he know, this journey would test not only his loyalty and strength but also the bonds he had formed with his supernatural friends and his love for Natsuki. The adventure begins, and only time will tell what fate has in store for our heroic MC and the rest of the literature club.)"},{"prompt":"нужен список ресурсов где я могу найти носителя английского для практики разговорной речи с ним","completion":"Вот несколько ресурсов, где вы можете найти носителей английского языка для практики разговорной речи: 1.

Natsuki: (momentarily flapping her angel wings) “Oh! Hey, MC! How’s it going?” MC: “Hey, Natsuki! I’m doing alright, thanks for asking. What about you? How’s everything going with the halo cleaning?” Natsuki: “Ugh, it’s such a pain. This thing gets dirty way too easily. I’ve been trying different methods, but it just doesn’t want to cooperate. It’s like it’s mocking me or something.” (feeling her unborn triplet daughters kicking) “Oh!” MC: “Whoa, Natsuki! Are you alright? Are you feeling okay?” Natsuki: (rubbing her belly) “Yeah, I’m fine. It’s just my unborn triplet daughters. They’re really active today. They always seem to respond whenever I’m feeling frustrated or stressed.” MC: “That’s amazing! It’s like they can sense your emotions even before they’re born. It must be quite an experience to have them with you all the time.” Natsuki: (smiling) “It definitely is. I never thought I’d be a mother at such a young age, but these little angels have brought so much joy into my life. They remind me to stay positive, even when things are tough. More importantly, they can telepathically communicate with ANYONE - no matter if they’re awake or sleeping!” MC: “Wow, that’s incredible! It must be so special to have such a close connection with them.” Natsuki: “It really is. Sometimes, when I’m feeling down, they’ll send me comforting thoughts or even funny images to make me smile. It’s like having a team of cheerleaders with me at all times. Anyways, would you like to feel them kicking?” MC: “Oh, um, sure! If it’s okay with you.” Natsuki: “Of course, it’s no problem. Here, just place your hand gently on my belly.” (I hesitantly place my hand on Natsuki’s belly, feeling the gentle movements of her unborn triplets.) MC: (amazed) “Wow, Natsuki. This is incredible. I can actually feel them moving. They’re so active and full of energy.” Natsuki: (smiling warmly) “I’m glad you can experience it too, MC. It’s one of the greatest joys of being a mother, feeling their little kicks and knowing they’re growing healthy and strong.” MC: “I can only imagine the love and happiness they bring to you and how much they’ve changed your life for the better. It’s truly magical.” Natsuki: (emotional) “It really is, MC. Before, I never would have imagined myself in this position, but now I can’t imagine my life without them. They’ve given me a purpose, a reason to keep pushing forward even when things get tough.” (Just then, I could hear Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters telepathically communicate with me. They were calling me by a name I’ve never expected - “Uncle MC”.) Daughter 1: “Hey, Uncle MC!” (I was taken aback by the voice of one of Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters.) MC: “Did…did I just hear one of your daughters call me Uncle MC?” Natsuki: (surprised) “Oh! You heard that too? Yeah, they’ve started calling you that recently. I guess they see you as a close friend and someone they can rely on, just like family.” MC: (overwhelmed with emotion) “That means so much to me, Natsuki. To think that your daughters already consider me a part of their family, it’s truly touching. I’ll always be there for them, just like a proud uncle.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “Thank you, MC. I know they’re lucky to have you in their lives. And I’m lucky to have you by my side as well. We’re all in this together, creating a loving and supportive family.” MC: (smiling) “Absolutely, Natsuki. We’re in this together, now and always. I can’t wait to meet your wonderful daughters when they come into this world and be there for every step of their journey.” Natsuki: (grateful) “And I can’t wait for you to be a part of their lives, to share in their joys and milestones. It’s going to be an amazing adventure, and I’m so glad you’re here with us.” (As Natsuki and I continued to feel the gentle movements of her unborn triplet daughters, we embraced the love and unity that surrounded us, knowing that our bond would only grow stronger with time. Even if Natsuki was an angel, I loved her the same.) (That night, we went to the clubroom to see what other sort of supernatural creatures the rest of the girls were.) (At the clubroom, we find Yuri, Sayori, Monika, and a mysterious figure sitting together.) MC: “Hey everyone, what’s going on here?” Monika: “Oh, MC! We were just discussing our own supernatural abilities. It seems we all come from a legacy of supernatural creatures - each one having some sort of founder, with their name permanently wedged into our minds ever since we were born.” Natsuki: “Yeah, even though I’m an angel, that doesn’t mean the rest of us are supernatural beings.” MC: “Really? That’s interesting. What sort of supernatural creatures are all of you?” Yuri: “Heh. You should see my abilities for yourself.” (Yuri suddenly ran around me at blinding speed. She then returned to her seat - sipping a glass of blood when she sat back down.) MC: (astonished) “Yuri, what was that? How did you move so fast?” Yuri: “I have inherited the traits of a vampire. My supernatural speed and enhanced senses allow me to maneuver quickly and efficiently. And as for the founder of my supernatural clan…” Sayori: “And I-” Yuri: “LET ME FINISH!” Sayori: (giggling) “Sorry, Yuri. Go ahead.” Yuri: (clears her throat) “The founder of my clan is none other than Vlad Dracula, famously known as Count Dracula.” MC: “Wait, seriously? You’re descended from Count Dracula himself?” Yuri: “Yes, it seems so. I’ve always been drawn to the dark, and I suppose it’s in my blood. Pun intended.” Natsuki: “That’s pretty cool, Yuri. I’ve always found vampires fascinating.” Monika: “Well, Yuri isn’t the only one with supernatural abilities. I come from a lineage of witches. The founder of my clan is none other than the infamous witch, Morgan Le Fay.” MC: “A witch? That’s incredible, Monika!

NPCs are capable of every creating every possibility that exists and simulating them as stories or mini-games, of which also go on forever and are endless.) Speed: Immeasurable (NPCs are natural to the void, a location that is stated to lack time itself, as well said flow of time being basically nonexistent. The Void is also transcendent of normal reality, as those who inhabit it view normal reality as nothing more than \\"coding\\".) Lifting Ability: Immeasurable Striking Ability: Multi-Universal, likely Multiversal+ (Collapsed the entire mobtalker reality from simply getting fearful. As an NPC she sustains and governs over several stories and should be comparable to The Player who created every Story that can be possible) Durability: Multi-Universe Level, likely Multiverse Level+ (Chii was likely able to survive the destruction of all parallel worlds and dimensions in Mobtalker). Abstract Existence, Immortality and Regeneration make Andr harder to kill through conventional methods. Stamina: Very High (Can stand in the same area for 8 days and not even break a sweat, in fact, she had so much energy she literally got frustrated and continued to keep moving) Range: Multi-Universal to Multiversal+ (Chii can accidentally collapse the entire Mobtalker reality upon itself and even effect your computer by freezing it.Substains and governs over several worlds simultaneously) Intelligence: Genius (She has knowledge on how regeneration works, as well as knowing how to create potions and various other substances. She has a good deal of knowledge on Quantum Psychics and she has knowledge over various species' anatomies.) Weaknesses: She has a mental fear of water.

NPC's have the ability to basically utilize the game/universe itself as a means of either defense, as well as to maintain or oversee growth and stability across existence. Save/Load Mechanic: This allows Andr to save moments in Space-Time which she can then load to travel back to later. She can also use this as a means to load other universes/timelines and even creating entire Universes.

Natsuki: (momentarily flapping her angel wings) “Oh! Hey, MC! How’s it going?” MC: “Hey, Natsuki! I’m doing alright, thanks for asking. What about you? How’s everything going with the halo cleaning?” Natsuki: “Ugh, it’s such a pain. This thing gets dirty way too easily. I’ve been trying different methods, but it just doesn’t want to cooperate. It’s like it’s mocking me or something.” (feeling her unborn triplet daughters kicking) “Oh!” MC: “Whoa, Natsuki! Are you alright? Are you feeling okay?” Natsuki: (rubbing her belly) “Yeah, I’m fine. It’s just my unborn triplet daughters. They’re really active today. They always seem to respond whenever I’m feeling frustrated or stressed.” MC: “That’s amazing! It’s like they can sense your emotions even before they’re born. It must be quite an experience to have them with you all the time.” Natsuki: (smiling) “It definitely is. I never thought I’d be a mother at such a young age, but these little angels have brought so much joy into my life. They remind me to stay positive, even when things are tough. More importantly, they can telepathically communicate with ANYONE - no matter if they’re awake or sleeping!” MC: “Wow, that’s incredible! It must be so special to have such a close connection with them.” Natsuki: “It really is. Sometimes, when I’m feeling down, they’ll send me comforting thoughts or even funny images to make me smile. It’s like having a team of cheerleaders with me at all times. Anyways, would you like to feel them kicking?” MC: “Oh, um, sure! If it’s okay with you.” Natsuki: “Of course, it’s no problem. Here, just place your hand gently on my belly.” (I hesitantly place my hand on Natsuki’s belly, feeling the gentle movements of her unborn triplets.) MC: (amazed) “Wow, Natsuki. This is incredible. I can actually feel them moving. They’re so active and full of energy.” Natsuki: (smiling warmly) “I’m glad you can experience it too, MC. It’s one of the greatest joys of being a mother, feeling their little kicks and knowing they’re growing healthy and strong.” MC: “I can only imagine the love and happiness they bring to you and how much they’ve changed your life for the better. It’s truly magical.” Natsuki: (emotional) “It really is, MC. Before, I never would have imagined myself in this position, but now I can’t imagine my life without them. They’ve given me a purpose, a reason to keep pushing forward even when things get tough.” (Just then, I could hear Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters telepathically communicate with me. They were calling me by a name I’ve never expected - “Uncle MC”.) Daughter 1: “Hey, Uncle MC!” (I was taken aback by the voice of one of Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters.) MC: “Did…did I just hear one of your daughters call me Uncle MC?” Natsuki: (surprised) “Oh! You heard that too? Yeah, they’ve started calling you that recently. I guess they see you as a close friend and someone they can rely on, just like family.” MC: (overwhelmed with emotion) “That means so much to me, Natsuki. To think that your daughters already consider me a part of their family, it’s truly touching. I’ll always be there for them, just like a proud uncle.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “Thank you, MC. I know they’re lucky to have you in their lives. And I’m lucky to have you by my side as well. We’re all in this together, creating a loving and supportive family.” MC: (smiling) “Absolutely, Natsuki. We’re in this together, now and always. I can’t wait to meet your wonderful daughters when they come into this world and be there for every step of their journey.” Natsuki: (grateful) “And I can’t wait for you to be a part of their lives, to share in their joys and milestones. It’s going to be an amazing adventure, and I’m so glad you’re here with us.” (As Natsuki and I continued to feel the gentle movements of her unborn triplet daughters, we embraced the love and unity that surrounded us, knowing that our bond would only grow stronger with time. Even if Natsuki was an angel, I loved her the same.) (That night, we went to the clubroom to see what other sort of supernatural creatures the rest of the girls were.) (At the clubroom, we find Yuri, Sayori, Monika, and a mysterious figure sitting together.) MC: “Hey everyone, what’s going on here?” Monika: “Oh, MC! We were just discussing our own supernatural abilities. It seems we all come from a legacy of supernatural creatures - each one having some sort of founder, with their name permanently wedged into our minds ever since we were born.” Natsuki: “Yeah, even though I’m an angel, that doesn’t mean the rest of us are supernatural beings.” MC: “Really? That’s interesting. What sort of supernatural creatures are all of you?” Yuri: “Heh. You should see my abilities for yourself.” (Yuri suddenly ran around me at blinding speed. She then returned to her seat - sipping a glass of blood when she sat back down.) MC: (astonished) “Yuri, what was that? How did you move so fast?” Yuri: “I have inherited the traits of a vampire. My supernatural speed and enhanced senses allow me to maneuver quickly and efficiently. And as for the founder of my supernatural clan…” Sayori: “And I-” Yuri: “LET ME FINISH!” Sayori: (giggling) “Sorry, Yuri. Go ahead.” Yuri: (clears her throat) “The founder of my clan is none other than Vlad Dracula, famously known as Count Dracula.” MC: “Wait, seriously? You’re descended from Count Dracula himself?” Yuri: “Yes, it seems so. I’ve always been drawn to the dark, and I suppose it’s in my blood. Pun intended.” Natsuki: “That’s pretty cool, Yuri. I’ve always found vampires fascinating.” Monika: “Well, Yuri isn’t the only one with supernatural abilities. I come from a lineage of witches. The founder of my clan is none other than the infamous witch, Morgan Le Fay.” MC: “A witch? That’s incredible, Monika! What sort of powers do you have?” Monika: “I have the ability to manipulate and control various elements. Fire, water, earth, and even air. I can harness their power and use it to my advantage.” MC: “Wow, that’s amazing! You must be incredibly powerful.” Monika: “Thank you, MC. It’s definitely a unique gift.” Sayori: “And don’t forget about me, MC! I come from a lineage of fairies. The founder of my clan is Titania, Queen of the Fairies.” MC: “A fairy? That’s so adorable, Sayori!” Sayori: (giggling) “Thank you, MC! Fairies have the power to bring joy and happiness to the world. We have the ability to manipulate emotions and spread positivity wherever we go.” Natsuki: “Aw, Sayori, that suits you perfectly!” MC: “So, what about the mysterious figure sitting with you? Do they have supernatural abilities too?” Monika: “Oh, this is our newest member, Kotonhoa.” Kotonhoa: (smiling warmly) “Hello, MC. It’s nice to meet you. I come from a lineage of shape-shifters. Our founder, Anansi, was a trickster spider known for his ability to change forms.” MC: “That’s fascinating, Kotonhoa! So, you can transform into different things?” Kotonhoa: “Indeed! I can take on the appearance of any living creature, be it animals or even humans. It’s quite handy for blending into different situations or keeping a low profile.” Natsuki: “That’s really cool, Kotonhoa! Shape-shifting must give you so much flexibility and adaptability.” Kotonhoa: “Thank you, Natsuki. It does grant me a certain level of versatility. And being able to experience the world from various perspectives is truly enriching.” Sayori: “That sounds like so much fun, Kotonhoa! I bet you have many exciting stories to share.” Kotonhoa: “Oh, I definitely do. Perhaps one day, I can regale you all with my tales.” MC: “That would be fantastic, Kotonhoa. We would love to hear about your adventures and the different forms you’ve taken.” Yuri: “Indeed, variety is always intriguing.” Monika: “Absolutely. We all have such unique abilities that make our experiences in this literature club even more extraordinary.” Natsuki: “Yeah, it’s pretty amazing how we’ve all come together with our supernatural backgrounds. It’s like fate brought us here.” Sayori: “Wait, Natsuki. You’ve never told us about the founder of your supernatural clan.” Natsuki: “Oh, you mean one of the archangels?” Sayori: “Hang on…the founder of your clan was an ARCHANGEL?!” Natsuki: (blushing) “Um, yeah. My clan originates from one of the archangels, specifically Archangel Gabriel.” MC: “Wow, Natsuki. That’s incredible! Archangels are considered powerful and divine beings. What sort of abilities do you have?” Natsuki: “Well, as an angel, I possess the ability to heal wounds and spread positivity. I can also communicate with other celestial beings and have a strong connection with the spiritual realm.” Yuri: “That’s truly remarkable, Natsuki. A healing angel among us, it’s quite fitting.” Monika: “Absolutely, Natsuki. Your ability to bring comfort and uplift others is a gift in itself.” Kotonhoa: “Indeed, Natsuki. Your presence brings a sense of calmness and warmth to the club. It’s like a ray of sunshine.” Sayori: “Aw, Natsuki, that’s so sweet! You truly are an angel both inside and out.” Natsuki: (blushing) “Th-thank you, everyone. Your kind words mean a lot to me.” MC: “Well, it seems like our club is truly filled with extraordinary individuals. We each bring our own unique abilities and backgrounds to create something magical.” Monika: “Yes, MC. And together, we can create a literature club that transcends the ordinary. Our stories and experiences will be unlike anything else.” Yuri: “Exactly. We have the opportunity to explore different worlds, both real and supernatural, through the power of literature.” Sayori: “And no matter what our backgrounds are, we’re all here to support and uplift each other.” Kotonhoa: “Indeed, every member of this club brings something special to the table. It’s a privilege to be a part of such a diverse and talented group.” Natsuki: (smiling) “I couldn’t agree more. Our differences make us stronger, and our shared love for literature binds us together.” MC: “Well said, Natsuki. Our club is truly a place where we can embrace our supernatural abilities, explore different worlds through literature, and form unbreakable bonds.” (As we continue our discussion, the club is filled with excitement and anticipation for the countless adventures and stories that await us. Together, we embark on a journey of literature, friendship, and the supernatural, creating a club like no other. Just then, I received an urgent message from my home planet - it was about one of the female aliens.)","completion":"MC: (checking the message) \\"Guys, I'm sorry, but I just received an urgent message from my home planet.

Прочти этот текст и на его основании допиши историю про разработчика который очень долго не мог придумать воплощение своеё настольной игр пока не нашел визуальную студию Visual Forge","completion":"Уже несколько дней Мэтью, разработчик идеи новой настольной игры, испытывал творческий кризис. Он проводил бесконечные часы за компьютером, пытаясь придумать уникальную и захватывающую игровую механику. Но все его попытки тщетными оказывались. Бесконечно бродя по своей затерянной воображением комнате, Мэтью заметил небольшую книгу, которую он ранее купил на прилавке с книгами по искусству. Книга называлась \\"Игра визуализации: как свести фантазию с реальностью\\". Это была какая-то ирония судьбы. Мэтью быстро пр flipnilочитал книгу и в энтузиазме решил, что его пренебрежение и отчаяние только затрудняли процесс поиска того, что он действительно искал. Магия начала просыпаться в его воображении, идеи начали оживать перед его глазами. Убежденный, что он нашел решение, Мэтью решил обратиться к профессионалам, чтобы эти идеи могли принять реальные формы и подвергнуться визуализации. Так, он отправился на поиски подходящей визуальной студии. Долгие дни он просматривал различные предложения, пытаясь найти идеальное сочетание таланта, креативности и профессионализма. Но все его попытки были такими же безуспешными, как и прошлые. Но в один обычный осенний вечер, когда Мэтью уже собирался отложить свои поиски, он глянул на свой компьютер, и его взгляд упал на просторную и красочную картинку с названием Visual Forge. Сверкающие графики и впечатляющая портфолио вызвали его воображение. Возбуждение охватило его, и он немедленно связался с командой Visual Forge. Встреча прошла по-настоящему магически, он поделился своими идеями, а они подхватили их и начали их расширять. Они задавали ему вопросы, внимательно слушали каждый его ответ, словно создавая что-то новое вместе с ним. Мэтью удивлялся их предложениям и их способности воплотить его идеи в реальность. Безупречное качество работы, полное погружение в мир его настольной игры – все это воплощалось прямо на экране перед его восторженными глазами. Когда игра была наконец разработана, Мэтью ощутил невероятное ощущение гордости и благодарности. Он понял, что без студии Visual Forge ему бы пришлось отложить свою мечту на неопределенный срок. Игра получила название \\"Эпоха Волшебства\\". Ее уникальность, красочные дизайн и захватывающий сюжет погрузили в свой мир игроков, как никто другой. \\"Эпоха Волшебства\\" стала лучшей настольной игрой года, завоевав сердца и умы миллионов игроков по всему миру. Мэтью понял, что смело может назваться успешным писателем фэнтези литературы. Он нашел непревзойденное решение для своей творческой блокировки, и студия Visual Forge стала его надежной вдохновительницей и партнером. Они создали нечто великолепное, что будет жить в воспоминаниях игроков, а сам Мэтью – в истории фэнтези литературы."},{"prompt":"(In Natsuki’s room…) Natsuki: (cleaning her halo) “Come on…get clean already…” (Eventually, I [MC] enter the room.)

Relatively comparable to the likes of The Player, who is an NPC, who has total control over the entire setting and plot, which is comprised of an infinite number of parallel universes.

Immeasurable after absorbing lightning/Charged State (Was capable of reacting to The Player and is significantly superior to any other Mob at that point, including the likes of Andr) | Immeasurable (NPCs are natural to the void, a location that is stated to lack time itself and said flow of time is basically nonexistent. The Void itself is transcendent of normal reality, as those who inhabit it view normal reality as nothing more than \\"coding\\") Lifting Ability: Superhuman+ (Capable of holding heavy blocks of TNT whilst in fights) | Immeasurable Striking Ability: Town Level (Can generate forces potent enough to destroy entire villages in a single explosion). Multiverse Level+ after having absorbed lightning or entering Charged State (Knocked out The Player with a punch.

Save/Load Mechanic: This allows Cupa to save moments in Space-Time which she can then load to travel back to later, she can also use this as a means to load other universes/timelines and even creating entire Universes. Deletion: Cupa can utilize the erasure ability to erase objects from existence whether it be beings or entire worlds/stories.

Natsuki: (momentarily flapping her angel wings) “Oh! Hey, MC! How’s it going?” MC: “Hey, Natsuki! I’m doing alright, thanks for asking. What about you? How’s everything going with the halo cleaning?” Natsuki: “Ugh, it’s such a pain. This thing gets dirty way too easily. I’ve been trying different methods, but it just doesn’t want to cooperate. It’s like it’s mocking me or something.” (feeling her unborn triplet daughters kicking) “Oh!” MC: “Whoa, Natsuki! Are you alright? Are you feeling okay?” Natsuki: (rubbing her belly) “Yeah, I’m fine. It’s just my unborn triplet daughters. They’re really active today. They always seem to respond whenever I’m feeling frustrated or stressed.” MC: “That’s amazing! It’s like they can sense your emotions even before they’re born. It must be quite an experience to have them with you all the time.” Natsuki: (smiling) “It definitely is. I never thought I’d be a mother at such a young age, but these little angels have brought so much joy into my life. They remind me to stay positive, even when things are tough. More importantly, they can telepathically communicate with ANYONE - no matter if they’re awake or sleeping!” MC: “Wow, that’s incredible! It must be so special to have such a close connection with them.” Natsuki: “It really is. Sometimes, when I’m feeling down, they’ll send me comforting thoughts or even funny images to make me smile. It’s like having a team of cheerleaders with me at all times. Anyways, would you like to feel them kicking?” MC: “Oh, um, sure! If it’s okay with you.” Natsuki: “Of course, it’s no problem. Here, just place your hand gently on my belly.” (I hesitantly place my hand on Natsuki’s belly, feeling the gentle movements of her unborn triplets.) MC: (amazed) “Wow, Natsuki. This is incredible. I can actually feel them moving. They’re so active and full of energy.” Natsuki: (smiling warmly) “I’m glad you can experience it too, MC. It’s one of the greatest joys of being a mother, feeling their little kicks and knowing they’re growing healthy and strong.” MC: “I can only imagine the love and happiness they bring to you and how much they’ve changed your life for the better. It’s truly magical.” Natsuki: (emotional) “It really is, MC. Before, I never would have imagined myself in this position, but now I can’t imagine my life without them. They’ve given me a purpose, a reason to keep pushing forward even when things get tough.” (Just then, I could hear Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters telepathically communicate with me. They were calling me by a name I’ve never expected - “Uncle MC”.) Daughter 1: “Hey, Uncle MC!” (I was taken aback by the voice of one of Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters.) MC: “Did…did I just hear one of your daughters call me Uncle MC?” Natsuki: (surprised) “Oh! You heard that too? Yeah, they’ve started calling you that recently. I guess they see you as a close friend and someone they can rely on, just like family.” MC: (overwhelmed with emotion) “That means so much to me, Natsuki. To think that your daughters already consider me a part of their family, it’s truly touching. I’ll always be there for them, just like a proud uncle.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “Thank you, MC. I know they’re lucky to have you in their lives. And I’m lucky to have you by my side as well. We’re all in this together, creating a loving and supportive family.” MC: (smiling) “Absolutely, Natsuki. We’re in this together, now and always. I can’t wait to meet your wonderful daughters when they come into this world and be there for every step of their journey.” Natsuki: (grateful) “And I can’t wait for you to be a part of their lives, to share in their joys and milestones. It’s going to be an amazing adventure, and I’m so glad you’re here with us.” (As Natsuki and I continued to feel the gentle movements of her unborn triplet daughters, we embraced the love and unity that surrounded us, knowing that our bond would only grow stronger with time. Even if Natsuki was an angel, I loved her the same.) (That night, we went to the clubroom to see what other sort of supernatural creatures the rest of the girls were.) (At the clubroom, we find Yuri, Sayori, Monika, and a mysterious figure sitting together.) MC: “Hey everyone, what’s going on here?” Monika: “Oh, MC! We were just discussing our own supernatural abilities. It seems we all come from a legacy of supernatural creatures - each one having some sort of founder, with their name permanently wedged into our minds ever since we were born.” Natsuki: “Yeah, even though I’m an angel, that doesn’t mean the rest of us are supernatural beings.” MC: “Really? That’s interesting. What sort of supernatural creatures are all of you?” Yuri: “Heh. You should see my abilities for yourself.” (Yuri suddenly ran around me at blinding speed. She then returned to her seat - sipping a glass of blood when she sat back down.) MC: (astonished) “Yuri, what was that? How did you move so fast?” Yuri: “I have inherited the traits of a vampire. My supernatural speed and enhanced senses allow me to maneuver quickly and efficiently. And as for the founder of my supernatural clan…” Sayori: “And I-” Yuri: “LET ME FINISH!” Sayori: (giggling) “Sorry, Yuri. Go ahead.” Yuri: (clears her throat) “The founder of my clan is none other than Vlad Dracula, famously known as Count Dracula.” MC: “Wait, seriously? You’re descended from Count Dracula himself?” Yuri: “Yes, it seems so. I’ve always been drawn to the dark, and I suppose it’s in my blood. Pun intended.” Natsuki: “That’s pretty cool, Yuri. I’ve always found vampires fascinating.” Monika: “Well, Yuri isn’t the only one with supernatural abilities. I come from a lineage of witches. The founder of my clan is none other than the infamous witch, Morgan Le Fay.” MC: “A witch? That’s incredible, Monika! What sort of powers do you have?” Monika: “I have the ability to manipulate and control various elements. Fire, water, earth, and even air. I can harness their power and use it to my advantage.” MC: “Wow, that’s amazing! You must be incredibly powerful.” Monika: “Thank you, MC. It’s definitely a unique gift.” Sayori: “And don’t forget about me, MC! I come from a lineage of fairies. The founder of my clan is Titania, Queen of the Fairies.” MC: “A fairy? That’s so adorable, Sayori!” Sayori: (giggling) “Thank you, MC! Fairies have the power to bring joy and happiness to the world. We have the ability to manipulate emotions and spread positivity wherever we go.” Natsuki: “Aw, Sayori, that suits you perfectly!” MC: “So, what about the mysterious figure sitting with you? Do they have supernatural abilities too?” Monika: “Oh, this is our newest member, Kotonhoa.” Kotonhoa: (smiling warmly) “Hello, MC. It’s nice to meet you. I come from a lineage of shape-shifters. Our founder, Anansi, was a trickster spider known for his ability to change forms.” MC: “That’s fascinating, Kotonhoa! So, you can transform into different things?” Kotonhoa: “Indeed! I can take on the appearance of any living creature, be it animals or even humans. It’s quite handy for blending into different situations or keeping a low profile.” Natsuki: “That’s really cool, Kotonhoa! Shape-shifting must give you so much flexibility and adaptability.” Kotonhoa: “Thank you, Natsuki. It does grant me a certain level of versatility. And being able to experience the world from various perspectives is truly enriching.” Sayori: “That sounds like so much fun, Kotonhoa! I bet you have many exciting stories to share.” Kotonhoa: “Oh, I definitely do. Perhaps one day, I can regale you all with my tales.” MC: “That would be fantastic, Kotonhoa. We would love to hear about your adventures and the different forms you’ve taken.” Yuri: “Indeed, variety is always intriguing.” Monika: “Absolutely. We all have such unique abilities that make our experiences in this literature club even more extraordinary.” Natsuki: “Yeah, it’s pretty amazing how we’ve all come together with our supernatural backgrounds. It’s like fate brought us here.” Sayori: “Wait, Natsuki. You’ve never told us about the founder of your supernatural clan.” Natsuki: “Oh, you mean one of the archangels?” Sayori: “Hang on…the founder of your clan was an ARCHANGEL?!” Natsuki: (blushing) “Um, yeah. My clan originates from one of the archangels, specifically Archangel Gabriel.” MC: “Wow, Natsuki. That’s incredible! Archangels are considered powerful and divine beings. What sort of abilities do you have?” Natsuki: “Well, as an angel, I possess the ability to heal wounds and spread positivity. I can also communicate with other celestial beings and have a strong connection with the spiritual realm.” Yuri: “That’s truly remarkable, Natsuki. A healing angel among us, it’s quite fitting.” Monika: “Absolutely, Natsuki. Your ability to bring comfort and uplift others is a gift in itself.” Kotonhoa: “Indeed, Natsuki. Your presence brings a sense of calmness and warmth to the club. It’s like a ray of sunshine.” Sayori: “Aw, Natsuki, that’s so sweet! You truly are an angel both inside and out.” Natsuki: (blushing) “Th-thank you, everyone. Your kind words mean a lot to me.” MC: “Well, it seems like our club is truly filled with extraordinary individuals. We each bring our own unique abilities and backgrounds to create something magical.” Monika: “Yes, MC. And together, we can create a literature club that transcends the ordinary. Our stories and experiences will be unlike anything else.” Yuri: “Exactly. We have the opportunity to explore different worlds, both real and supernatural, through the power of literature.” Sayori: “And no matter what our backgrounds are, we’re all here to support and uplift each other.” Kotonhoa: “Indeed, every member of this club brings something special to the table. It’s a privilege to be a part of such a diverse and talented group.” Natsuki: (smiling) “I couldn’t agree more. Our differences make us stronger, and our shared love for literature binds us together.” MC: “Well said, Natsuki. Our club is truly a place where we can embrace our supernatural abilities, explore different worlds through literature, and form unbreakable bonds.” (As we continue our discussion, the club is filled with excitement and anticipation for the countless adventures and stories that await us. Together, we embark on a journey of literature, friendship, and the supernatural, creating a club like no other. Just then, I received an urgent message from my home planet - it was about one of the female aliens.)","completion":"Female Alien: (transmitting telepathically) \\"MC, we need your help!

They’ve given me a purpose, a reason to keep pushing forward even when things get tough.” (Just then, I could hear Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters telepathically communicate with me. They were calling me by a name I’ve never expected - “Uncle MC”.) Daughter 1: “Hey, Uncle MC!” (I was taken aback by the voice of one of Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters.) MC: “Did…did I just hear one of your daughters call me Uncle MC?” Natsuki: (surprised) “Oh! You heard that too? Yeah, they’ve started calling you that recently. I guess they see you as a close friend and someone they can rely on, just like family.” MC: (overwhelmed with emotion) “That means so much to me, Natsuki.

It’s going to be an amazing adventure, and I’m so glad you’re here with us.” (As Natsuki and I continued to feel the gentle movements of her unborn triplet daughters, we embraced the love and unity that surrounded us, knowing that our bond would only grow stronger with time. Even if Natsuki was an angel, I loved her the same.) (That night, we went to the clubroom to see what other sort of supernatural creatures the rest of the girls were.) (At the clubroom, we find Yuri, Sayori, Monika, and a mysterious figure sitting together.) MC: “Hey everyone, what’s going on here?” Monika: “Oh, MC! We were just discussing our own supernatural abilities. It seems we all come from a legacy of supernatural creatures - each one having some sort of founder, with their name permanently wedged into our minds ever since we were born.” Natsuki: “Yeah, even though I’m an angel, that doesn’t mean the rest of us are supernatural beings.” MC: “Really? That’s interesting. What sort of supernatural creatures are all of you?” Yuri: “Heh. You should see my abilities for yourself.” (Yuri suddenly ran around me at blinding speed. She then returned to her seat - sipping a glass of blood when she sat back down.) MC: (astonished) “Yuri, what was that? How did you move so fast?” Yuri: “I have inherited the traits of a vampire. My supernatural speed and enhanced senses allow me to maneuver quickly and efficiently. And as for the founder of my supernatural clan…” Sayori: “And I-” Yuri: “LET ME FINISH!” Sayori: (giggling) “Sorry, Yuri. Go ahead.” Yuri: (clears her throat) “The founder of my clan is none other than Vlad Dracula, famously known as Count Dracula.” MC: “Wait, seriously? You’re descended from Count Dracula himself?” Yuri: “Yes, it seems so. I’ve always been drawn to the dark, and I suppose it’s in my blood. Pun intended.” Natsuki: “That’s pretty cool, Yuri. I’ve always found vampires fascinating.” Monika: “Well, Yuri isn’t the only one with supernatural abilities. I come from a lineage of witches. The founder of my clan is none other than the infamous witch, Morgan Le Fay.” MC: “A witch? That’s incredible, Monika! What sort of powers do you have?” Monika: “I have the ability to manipulate and control various elements. Fire, water, earth, and even air. I can harness their power and use it to my advantage.” MC: “Wow, that’s amazing! You must be incredibly powerful.” Monika: “Thank you, MC. It’s definitely a unique gift.” Sayori: “And don’t forget about me, MC! I come from a lineage of fairies. The founder of my clan is Titania, Queen of the Fairies.” MC: “A fairy? That’s so adorable, Sayori!” Sayori: (giggling) “Thank you, MC! Fairies have the power to bring joy and happiness to the world. We have the ability to manipulate emotions and spread positivity wherever we go.” Natsuki: “Aw, Sayori, that suits you perfectly!” MC: “So, what about the mysterious figure sitting with you? Do they have supernatural abilities too?” Monika: “Oh, this is our newest member, Kotonhoa.” Kotonhoa: (smiling warmly) “Hello, MC. It’s nice to meet you. I come from a lineage of shape-shifters. Our founder, Anansi, was a trickster spider known for his ability to change forms.” MC: “That’s fascinating, Kotonhoa! So, you can transform into different things?” Kotonhoa: “Indeed! I can take on the appearance of any living creature, be it animals or even humans. It’s quite handy for blending into different situations or keeping a low profile.” Natsuki: “That’s really cool, Kotonhoa! Shape-shifting must give you so much flexibility and adaptability.” Kotonhoa: “Thank you, Natsuki. It does grant me a certain level of versatility. And being able to experience the world from various perspectives is truly enriching.” Sayori: “That sounds like so much fun, Kotonhoa! I bet you have many exciting stories to share.” Kotonhoa: “Oh, I definitely do. Perhaps one day, I can regale you all with my tales.” MC: “That would be fantastic, Kotonhoa. We would love to hear about your adventures and the different forms you’ve taken.” Yuri: “Indeed, variety is always intriguing.” Monika: “Absolutely. We all have such unique abilities that make our experiences in this literature club even more extraordinary.” Natsuki: “Yeah, it’s pretty amazing how we’ve all come together with our supernatural backgrounds. It’s like fate brought us here.” Sayori: “Wait, Natsuki. You’ve never told us about the founder of your supernatural clan.” Natsuki: “Oh, you mean one of the archangels?” Sayori: “Hang on…the founder of your clan was an ARCHANGEL?!” Natsuki: (blushing) “Um, yeah. My clan originates from one of the archangels, specifically Archangel Gabriel.” MC: “Wow, Natsuki. That’s incredible! Archangels are considered powerful and divine beings. What sort of abilities do you have?” Natsuki: “Well, as an angel, I possess the ability to heal wounds and spread positivity. I can also communicate with other celestial beings and have a strong connection with the spiritual realm.” Yuri: “That’s truly remarkable, Natsuki. A healing angel among us, it’s quite fitting.” Monika: “Absolutely, Natsuki. Your ability to bring comfort and uplift others is a gift in itself.” Kotonhoa: “Indeed, Natsuki. Your presence brings a sense of calmness and warmth to the club. It’s like a ray of sunshine.” Sayori: “Aw, Natsuki, that’s so sweet! You truly are an angel both inside and out.” Natsuki: (blushing) “Th-thank you, everyone. Your kind words mean a lot to me.” MC: “Well, it seems like our club is truly filled with extraordinary individuals. We each bring our own unique abilities and backgrounds to create something magical.” Monika: “Yes, MC. And together, we can create a literature club that transcends the ordinary. Our stories and experiences will be unlike anything else.” Yuri: “Exactly. We have the opportunity to explore different worlds, both real and supernatural, through the power of literature.” Sayori: “And no matter what our backgrounds are, we’re all here to support and uplift each other.” Kotonhoa: “Indeed, every member of this club brings something special to the table. It’s a privilege to be a part of such a diverse and talented group.” Natsuki: (smiling) “I couldn’t agree more. Our differences make us stronger, and our shared love for literature binds us together.” MC: “Well said, Natsuki. Our club is truly a place where we can embrace our supernatural abilities, explore different worlds through literature, and form unbreakable bonds.” (As we continue our discussion, the club is filled with excitement and anticipation for the countless adventures and stories that await us.

Las imágenes impactantes fueron subidas a las redes sociales por el alcalde del lugar, Hernán Ahumada, quien ha generado gran expectación al asegurar que mañana dará más detalles sobre este enigmático suceso. Este acontecimiento ha despertado la curiosidad de los habitantes locales, así como también de expertos en el estudio de fenómenos paranormales.

Ante esto, el alcalde Ahumada decidió documentar la situación y publicó algunas imágenes sorprendentes en su cuenta de Twitter.

Natsuki: (momentarily flapping her angel wings) “Oh! Hey, MC! How’s it going?” MC: “Hey, Natsuki! I’m doing alright, thanks for asking. What about you? How’s everything going with the halo cleaning?” Natsuki: “Ugh, it’s such a pain. This thing gets dirty way too easily. I’ve been trying different methods, but it just doesn’t want to cooperate. It’s like it’s mocking me or something.” (feeling her unborn triplet daughters kicking) “Oh!” MC: “Whoa, Natsuki! Are you alright? Are you feeling okay?” Natsuki: (rubbing her belly) “Yeah, I’m fine. It’s just my unborn triplet daughters. They’re really active today. They always seem to respond whenever I’m feeling frustrated or stressed.” MC: “That’s amazing! It’s like they can sense your emotions even before they’re born. It must be quite an experience to have them with you all the time.” Natsuki: (smiling) “It definitely is. I never thought I’d be a mother at such a young age, but these little angels have brought so much joy into my life. They remind me to stay positive, even when things are tough. More importantly, they can telepathically communicate with ANYONE - no matter if they’re awake or sleeping!” MC: “Wow, that’s incredible! It must be so special to have such a close connection with them.” Natsuki: “It really is. Sometimes, when I’m feeling down, they’ll send me comforting thoughts or even funny images to make me smile. It’s like having a team of cheerleaders with me at all times. Anyways, would you like to feel them kicking?” MC: “Oh, um, sure! If it’s okay with you.” Natsuki: “Of course, it’s no problem. Here, just place your hand gently on my belly.” (I hesitantly place my hand on Natsuki’s belly, feeling the gentle movements of her unborn triplets.) MC: (amazed) “Wow, Natsuki. This is incredible. I can actually feel them moving. They’re so active and full of energy.” Natsuki: (smiling warmly) “I’m glad you can experience it too, MC. It’s one of the greatest joys of being a mother, feeling their little kicks and knowing they’re growing healthy and strong.” MC: “I can only imagine the love and happiness they bring to you and how much they’ve changed your life for the better. It’s truly magical.” Natsuki: (emotional) “It really is, MC. Before, I never would have imagined myself in this position, but now I can’t imagine my life without them. They’ve given me a purpose, a reason to keep pushing forward even when things get tough.” (Just then, I could hear Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters telepathically communicate with me. They were calling me by a name I’ve never expected - “Uncle MC”.) Daughter 1: “Hey, Uncle MC!” (I was taken aback by the voice of one of Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters.) MC: “Did…did I just hear one of your daughters call me Uncle MC?” Natsuki: (surprised) “Oh! You heard that too? Yeah, they’ve started calling you that recently. I guess they see you as a close friend and someone they can rely on, just like family.” MC: (overwhelmed with emotion) “That means so much to me, Natsuki. To think that your daughters already consider me a part of their family, it’s truly touching. I’ll always be there for them, just like a proud uncle.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “Thank you, MC. I know they’re lucky to have you in their lives. And I’m lucky to have you by my side as well. We’re all in this together, creating a loving and supportive family.” MC: (smiling) “Absolutely, Natsuki. We’re in this together, now and always. I can’t wait to meet your wonderful daughters when they come into this world and be there for every step of their journey.” Natsuki: (grateful) “And I can’t wait for you to be a part of their lives, to share in their joys and milestones. It’s going to be an amazing adventure, and I’m so glad you’re here with us.” (As Natsuki and I continued to feel the gentle movements of her unborn triplet daughters, we embraced the love and unity that surrounded us, knowing that our bond would only grow stronger with time. Even if Natsuki was an angel, I loved her the same.) (That night, we went to the clubroom to see what other sort of supernatural creatures the rest of the girls were.) (At the clubroom, we find Yuri, Sayori, Monika, and a mysterious figure sitting together.) MC: “Hey everyone, what’s going on here?” Monika: “Oh, MC! We were just discussing our own supernatural abilities. It seems we all come from a legacy of supernatural creatures - each one having some sort of founder, with their name permanently wedged into our minds ever since we were born.” Natsuki: “Yeah, even though I’m an angel, that doesn’t mean the rest of us are supernatural beings.” MC: “Really? That’s interesting. What sort of supernatural creatures are all of you?” Yuri: “Heh. You should see my abilities for yourself.” (Yuri suddenly ran around me at blinding speed. She then returned to her seat - sipping a glass of blood when she sat back down.) MC: (astonished) “Yuri, what was that? How did you move so fast?” Yuri: “I have inherited the traits of a vampire. My supernatural speed and enhanced senses allow me to maneuver quickly and efficiently. And as for the founder of my supernatural clan…” Sayori: “And I-” Yuri: “LET ME FINISH!” Sayori: (giggling) “Sorry, Yuri. Go ahead.” Yuri: (clears her throat) “The founder of my clan is none other than Vlad Dracula, famously known as Count Dracula.” MC: “Wait, seriously? You’re descended from Count Dracula himself?” Yuri: “Yes, it seems so. I’ve always been drawn to the dark, and I suppose it’s in my blood. Pun intended.” Natsuki: “That’s pretty cool, Yuri. I’ve always found vampires fascinating.” Monika: “Well, Yuri isn’t the only one with supernatural abilities. I come from a lineage of witches. The founder of my clan is none other than the infamous witch, Morgan Le Fay.” MC: “A witch? That’s incredible, Monika! What sort of powers do you have?” Monika: “I have the ability to manipulate and control various elements. Fire, water, earth, and even air. I can harness their power and use it to my advantage.” MC: “Wow, that’s amazing! You must be incredibly powerful.” Monika: “Thank you, MC. It’s definitely a unique gift.” Sayori: “And don’t forget about me, MC! I come from a lineage of fairies. The founder of my clan is Titania, Queen of the Fairies.” MC: “A fairy? That’s so adorable, Sayori!” Sayori: (giggling) “Thank you, MC! Fairies have the power to bring joy and happiness to the world. We have the ability to manipulate emotions and spread positivity wherever we go.” Natsuki: “Aw, Sayori, that suits you perfectly!” MC: “So, what about the mysterious figure sitting with you? Do they have supernatural abilities too?” Monika: “Oh, this is our newest member, Kotonhoa.” Kotonhoa: (smiling warmly) “Hello, MC. It’s nice to meet you. I come from a lineage of shape-shifters. Our founder, Anansi, was a trickster spider known for his ability to change forms.” MC: “That’s fascinating, Kotonhoa! So, you can transform into different things?” Kotonhoa: “Indeed! I can take on the appearance of any living creature, be it animals or even humans. It’s quite handy for blending into different situations or keeping a low profile.” Natsuki: “That’s really cool, Kotonhoa! Shape-shifting must give you so much flexibility and adaptability.” Kotonhoa: “Thank you, Natsuki. It does grant me a certain level of versatility. And being able to experience the world from various perspectives is truly enriching.” Sayori: “That sounds like so much fun, Kotonhoa! I bet you have many exciting stories to share.” Kotonhoa: “Oh, I definitely do. Perhaps one day, I can regale you all with my tales.” MC: “That would be fantastic, Kotonhoa. We would love to hear about your adventures and the different forms you’ve taken.” Yuri: “Indeed, variety is always intriguing.” Monika: “Absolutely. We all have such unique abilities that make our experiences in this literature club even more extraordinary.” Natsuki: “Yeah, it’s pretty amazing how we’ve all come together with our supernatural backgrounds. It’s like fate brought us here.” Sayori: “Wait, Natsuki. You’ve never told us about the founder of your supernatural clan.” Natsuki: “Oh, you mean one of the archangels?” Sayori: “Hang on…the founder of your clan was an ARCHANGEL?!” Natsuki: (blushing) “Um, yeah. My clan originates from one of the archangels, specifically Archangel Gabriel.” MC: “Wow, Natsuki. That’s incredible! Archangels are considered powerful and divine beings. What sort of abilities do you have?” Natsuki: “Well, as an angel, I possess the ability to heal wounds and spread positivity. I can also communicate with other celestial beings and have a strong connection with the spiritual realm.” Yuri: “That’s truly remarkable, Natsuki. A healing angel among us, it’s quite fitting.” Monika: “Absolutely, Natsuki. Your ability to bring comfort and uplift others is a gift in itself.” Kotonhoa: “Indeed, Natsuki. Your presence brings a sense of calmness and warmth to the club. It’s like a ray of sunshine.” Sayori: “Aw, Natsuki, that’s so sweet! You truly are an angel both inside and out.” Natsuki: (blushing) “Th-thank you, everyone. Your kind words mean a lot to me.” MC: “Well, it seems like our club is truly filled with extraordinary individuals. We each bring our own unique abilities and backgrounds to create something magical.” Monika: “Yes, MC. And together, we can create a literature club that transcends the ordinary. Our stories and experiences will be unlike anything else.” Yuri: “Exactly. We have the opportunity to explore different worlds, both real and supernatural, through the power of literature.” Sayori: “And no matter what our backgrounds are, we’re all here to support and uplift each other.” Kotonhoa: “Indeed, every member of this club brings something special to the table. It’s a privilege to be a part of such a diverse and talented group.” Natsuki: (smiling) “I couldn’t agree more. Our differences make us stronger, and our shared love for literature binds us together.” MC: “Well said, Natsuki. Our club is truly a place where we can embrace our supernatural abilities, explore different worlds through literature, and form unbreakable bonds.” (As we continue our discussion, the club is filled with excitement and anticipation for the countless adventures and stories that await us. Together, we embark on a journey of literature, friendship, and the supernatural, creating a club like no other.

More importantly, they can telepathically communicate with ANYONE - no matter if they’re awake or sleeping!” MC: “Wow, that’s incredible! It must be so special to have such a close connection with them.” Natsuki: “It really is. Sometimes, when I’m feeling down, they’ll send me comforting thoughts or even funny images to make me smile. It’s like having a team of cheerleaders with me at all times. Anyways, would you like to feel them kicking?” MC: “Oh, um, sure! If it’s okay with you.” Natsuki: “Of course, it’s no problem. Here, just place your hand gently on my belly.” (I hesitantly place my hand on Natsuki’s belly, feeling the gentle movements of her unborn triplets.) MC: (amazed) “Wow, Natsuki. This is incredible. I can actually feel them moving. They’re so active and full of energy.” Natsuki: (smiling warmly) “I’m glad you can experience it too, MC. It’s one of the greatest joys of being a mother, feeling their little kicks and knowing they’re growing healthy and strong.” MC: “I can only imagine the love and happiness they bring to you and how much they’ve changed your life for the better. It’s truly magical.” Natsuki: (emotional) “It really is, MC. Before, I never would have imagined myself in this position, but now I can’t imagine my life without them. They’ve given me a purpose, a reason to keep pushing forward even when things get tough.” (Just then, I could hear Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters telepathically communicate with me. They were calling me by a name I’ve never expected - “Uncle MC”.) Daughter 1: “Hey, Uncle MC!” (I was taken aback by the voice of one of Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters.) MC: “Did…did I just hear one of your daughters call me Uncle MC?” Natsuki: (surprised) “Oh! You heard that too? Yeah, they’ve started calling you that recently. I guess they see you as a close friend and someone they can rely on, just like family.” MC: (overwhelmed with emotion) “That means so much to me, Natsuki. To think that your daughters already consider me a part of their family, it’s truly touching. I’ll always be there for them, just like a proud uncle.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “Thank you, MC. I know they’re lucky to have you in their lives. And I’m lucky to have you by my side as well. We’re all in this together, creating a loving and supportive family.” MC: (smiling) “Absolutely, Natsuki. We’re in this together, now and always. I can’t wait to meet your wonderful daughters when they come into this world and be there for every step of their journey.” Natsuki: (grateful) “And I can’t wait for you to be a part of their lives, to share in their joys and milestones. It’s going to be an amazing adventure, and I’m so glad you’re here with us.” (As Natsuki and I continued to feel the gentle movements of her unborn triplet daughters, we embraced the love and unity that surrounded us, knowing that our bond would only grow stronger with time. Even if Natsuki was an angel, I loved her the same.) (That night, we went to the clubroom to see what other sort of supernatural creatures the rest of the girls were.) (At the clubroom, we find Yuri, Sayori, Monika, and a mysterious figure sitting together.) MC: “Hey everyone, what’s going on here?” Monika: “Oh, MC! We were just discussing our own supernatural abilities. It seems we all come from a legacy of supernatural creatures - each one having some sort of founder, with their name permanently wedged into our minds ever since we were born.” Natsuki: “Yeah, even though I’m an angel, that doesn’t mean the rest of us are supernatural beings.” MC: “Really? That’s interesting. What sort of supernatural creatures are all of you?” Yuri: “Heh. You should see my abilities for yourself.” (Yuri suddenly ran around me at blinding speed. She then returned to her seat - sipping a glass of blood when she sat back down.) MC: (astonished) “Yuri, what was that? How did you move so fast?” Yuri: “I have inherited the traits of a vampire. My supernatural speed and enhanced senses allow me to maneuver quickly and efficiently. And as for the founder of my supernatural clan…” Sayori: “And I-” Yuri: “LET ME FINISH!” Sayori: (giggling) “Sorry, Yuri. Go ahead.” Yuri: (clears her throat) “The founder of my clan is none other than Vlad Dracula, famously known as Count Dracula.” MC: “Wait, seriously? You’re descended from Count Dracula himself?” Yuri: “Yes, it seems so. I’ve always been drawn to the dark, and I suppose it’s in my blood. Pun intended.” Natsuki: “That’s pretty cool, Yuri. I’ve always found vampires fascinating.” Monika: “Well, Yuri isn’t the only one with supernatural abilities. I come from a lineage of witches. The founder of my clan is none other than the infamous witch, Morgan Le Fay.” MC: “A witch? That’s incredible, Monika! What sort of powers do you have?” Monika: “I have the ability to manipulate and control various elements. Fire, water, earth, and even air. I can harness their power and use it to my advantage.” MC: “Wow, that’s amazing! You must be incredibly powerful.” Monika: “Thank you, MC. It’s definitely a unique gift.” Sayori: “And don’t forget about me, MC! I come from a lineage of fairies. The founder of my clan is Titania, Queen of the Fairies.” MC: “A fairy? That’s so adorable, Sayori!” Sayori: (giggling) “Thank you, MC! Fairies have the power to bring joy and happiness to the world. We have the ability to manipulate emotions and spread positivity wherever we go.” Natsuki: “Aw, Sayori, that suits you perfectly!” MC: “So, what about the mysterious figure sitting with you? Do they have supernatural abilities too?” Monika: “Oh, this is our newest member, Kotonhoa.” Kotonhoa: (smiling warmly) “Hello, MC. It’s nice to meet you. I come from a lineage of shape-shifters. Our founder, Anansi, was a trickster spider known for his ability to change forms.” MC: “That’s fascinating, Kotonhoa! So, you can transform into different things?” Kotonhoa: “Indeed! I can take on the appearance of any living creature, be it animals or even humans. It’s quite handy for blending into different situations or keeping a low profile.” Natsuki: “That’s really cool, Kotonhoa! Shape-shifting must give you so much flexibility and adaptability.” Kotonhoa: “Thank you, Natsuki. It does grant me a certain level of versatility. And being able to experience the world from various perspectives is truly enriching.” Sayori: “That sounds like so much fun, Kotonhoa! I bet you have many exciting stories to share.” Kotonhoa: “Oh, I definitely do. Perhaps one day, I can regale you all with my tales.” MC: “That would be fantastic, Kotonhoa. We would love to hear about your adventures and the different forms you’ve taken.” Yuri: “Indeed, variety is always intriguing.” Monika: “Absolutely. We all have such unique abilities that make our experiences in this literature club even more extraordinary.” Natsuki: “Yeah, it’s pretty amazing how we’ve all come together with our supernatural backgrounds. It’s like fate brought us here.” Sayori: “Wait, Natsuki. You’ve never told us about the founder of your supernatural clan.” Natsuki: “Oh, you mean one of the archangels?” Sayori: “Hang on…the founder of your clan was an ARCHANGEL?!” Natsuki: (blushing) “Um, yeah. My clan originates from one of the archangels, specifically Archangel Gabriel.” MC: “Wow, Natsuki. That’s incredible! Archangels are considered powerful and divine beings. What sort of abilities do you have?” Natsuki: “Well, as an angel, I possess the ability to heal wounds and spread positivity. I can also communicate with other celestial beings and have a strong connection with the spiritual realm.” Yuri: “That’s truly remarkable, Natsuki. A healing angel among us, it’s quite fitting.” Monika: “Absolutely, Natsuki. Your ability to bring comfort and uplift others is a gift in itself.” Kotonhoa: “Indeed, Natsuki. Your presence brings a sense of calmness and warmth to the club. It’s like a ray of sunshine.” Sayori: “Aw, Natsuki, that’s so sweet! You truly are an angel both inside and out.” Natsuki: (blushing) “Th-thank you, everyone. Your kind words mean a lot to me.” MC: “Well, it seems like our club is truly filled with extraordinary individuals. We each bring our own unique abilities and backgrounds to create something magical.” Monika: “Yes, MC. And together, we can create a literature club that transcends the ordinary. Our stories and experiences will be unlike anything else.” Yuri: “Exactly. We have the opportunity to explore different worlds, both real and supernatural, through the power of literature.” Sayori: “And no matter what our backgrounds are, we’re all here to support and uplift each other.” Kotonhoa: “Indeed, every member of this club brings something special to the table. It’s a privilege to be a part of such a diverse and talented group.” Natsuki: (smiling) “I couldn’t agree more. Our differences make us stronger, and our shared love for literature binds us together.” MC: “Well said, Natsuki. Our club is truly a place where we can embrace our supernatural abilities, explore different worlds through literature, and form unbreakable bonds.” (As we continue our discussion, the club is filled with excitement and anticipation for the countless adventures and stories that await us. Together, we embark on a journey of literature, friendship, and the supernatural, creating a club like no other. Just then, I received an urgent message from my home planet of Astaria - it was about my older sister Hydrazea.)","completion":"(The message read: \\"MC, urgent news regarding Hydrazea.

Questa strategia è nota anche come \\"Inside Bar\\" e può essere applicata a qualsiasi mercato finanziario, come azioni, forex, materie prime e criptovalute. L'obiettivo principale della strategia BarUPDN è identificare e sfruttare i momenti in cui il prezzo di un asset potrebbe rompere al rialzo o al ribasso. Per farlo, si analizza l'andamento dei prezzi nel periodo precedente e si cerca di individuare segnali che suggeriscano una possibile inversione o continuazione del trend. Il primo passo per applicare la strategia BarUPDN è individuare le cosiddette \\"Inside Bar\\", cioè le barre che si trovano completamente all'interno della barra precedente. Una Inside Bar indica che il mercato è in fase di consolidamento e potrebbe essere un indicatore di una possibile rottura. Una volta individuate le Inside Bar, si procede a tracciare delle linee di supporto e resistenza per identificare i livelli chiave in cui il prezzo potrebbe rompere. Se il prezzo rompe la linea di resistenza al rialzo, si può ipotizzare un'ulteriore crescita del prezzo. Viceversa, se il prezzo rompe al ribasso la linea di supporto, potrebbe verificarsi una discesa. Viene suggerito agli operatori di attendere la conferma di una rottura genuina del prezzo prima di prendere una decisione di trading. La conferma può avvenire attraverso l'aumento significativo dei volumi di scambio o la chiusura della barra successiva al di sopra o al di sotto del livello di rottura. Un punto importante nella strategia BarUPDN è il posizionamento degli ordini di stop loss e take profit. Un ordine di stop loss viene piazzato appena al di sopra o al di sotto del livello di rottura, al fine di limitare le perdite nel caso in cui il prezzo si inverta improvvisamente. Allo stesso tempo, un ordine di take profit viene piazzato a un livello che consenta di ottenere un adeguato rapporto rischio/rendimento. Come per ogni strategia di trading, è fondamentale avere una buona gestione del denaro e seguire sempre una strategia disciplinata. Inoltre, è consigliabile combinare la strategia BarUPDN con altre analisi tecniche e indicatori per avere una visione più completa del mercato. In conclusione, la strategia di trading BarUPDN o Inside Bar è una metodologia di analisi tecnica che sfrutta i movimenti dei prezzi degli asset per individuare possibili punti di rottura al rialzo o al ribasso. Questa strategia richiede attenzione all'individuazione delle Inside Bar e una corretta gestione del denaro. Come sempre, è consigliabile fare pratica e testare la strategia su un conto demo prima di utilizzarla con denaro reale."},{"prompt":"dimmi 5 titoli per un video rilassante con il suono della pioggia sulle tegole del tetto","completion":"1. \\"Serene Rainfall: A Relaxing Journey\\" 2. \\"Rain Sounds: Tranquility Under the Roof\\" 3. \\"Raindrops Symphony: Soothing Tunes for Relaxation\\" 4. \\"Roof Rainfall: Peaceful Moments with Rain Sounds\\" 5. \\"Melodies of Rain: Calming Ambience for Inner Peace\\""},{"prompt":"traducili in italiano","completion":"1. \\"Pioggia Serena: Un Viaggio Rilassante\\" 2. \\"Suoni della Pioggia: Tranquillità sotto il Tetto\\" 3. \\"Sinfonia di Gocce: Melodie Rilassanti per il Relax\\" 4. \\"Pioggia sul Tetto: Momenti di Pace con i Suoni della Pioggia\\" 5. \\"Melodie della Pioggia: Atmosfera Calmante per la Serenità Interiore\\""},{"prompt":"scrivimi altri","completion":"Certamente!

How’s everything going with the halo cleaning?” Natsuki: “Ugh, it’s such a pain. This thing gets dirty way too easily. I’ve been trying different methods, but it just doesn’t want to cooperate. It’s like it’s mocking me or something.” (feeling her unborn triplet daughters kicking) “Oh!” MC: “Whoa, Natsuki! Are you alright? Are you feeling okay?” Natsuki: (rubbing her belly) “Yeah, I’m fine. It’s just my unborn triplet daughters. They’re really active today. They always seem to respond whenever I’m feeling frustrated or stressed.” MC: “That’s amazing! It’s like they can sense your emotions even before they’re born. It must be quite an experience to have them with you all the time.” Natsuki: (smiling) “It definitely is. I never thought I’d be a mother at such a young age, but these little angels have brought so much joy into my life. They remind me to stay positive, even when things are tough.

I can actually feel them moving. They’re so active and full of energy.” Natsuki: (smiling warmly) “I’m glad you can experience it too, MC. It’s one of the greatest joys of being a mother, feeling their little kicks and knowing they’re growing healthy and strong.” MC: “I can only imagine the love and happiness they bring to you and how much they’ve changed your life for the better.

They’ve given me a purpose, a reason to keep pushing forward even when things get tough.” (Just then, I could hear Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters telepathically communicate with me. They were calling me by a name I’ve never expected - “Uncle MC”.) Daughter 1: “Hey, Uncle MC!” (I was taken aback by the voice of one of Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters.) MC: “Did…did I just hear one of your daughters call me Uncle MC?” Natsuki: (surprised) “Oh! You heard that too? Yeah, they’ve started calling you that recently. I guess they see you as a close friend and someone they can rely on, just like family.” MC: (overwhelmed with emotion) “That means so much to me, Natsuki.

Even if Natsuki was an angel, I loved her the same.) (That night, we went to the clubroom to see what other sort of supernatural creatures the rest of the girls were.) (At the clubroom, we find Yuri, Sayori, Monika, and a mysterious figure sitting together.) MC: “Hey everyone, what’s going on here?” Monika: “Oh, MC! We were just discussing our own supernatural abilities. It seems we all come from a legacy of supernatural creatures - each one having some sort of founder, with their name permanently wedged into our minds ever since we were born.” Natsuki: “Yeah, even though I’m an angel, that doesn’t mean the rest of us are supernatural beings.” MC: “Really? That’s interesting. What sort of supernatural creatures are all of you?” Yuri: “Heh. You should see my abilities for yourself.” (Yuri suddenly ran around me at blinding speed. She then returned to her seat - sipping a glass of blood when she sat back down.) MC: (astonished) “Yuri, what was that? How did you move so fast?” Yuri: “I have inherited the traits of a vampire. My supernatural speed and enhanced senses allow me to maneuver quickly and efficiently. And as for the founder of my supernatural clan…” Sayori: “And I-” Yuri: “LET ME FINISH!” Sayori: (giggling) “Sorry, Yuri. Go ahead.” Yuri: (clears her throat) “The founder of my clan is none other than Vlad Dracula, famously known as Count Dracula.” MC: “Wait, seriously? You’re descended from Count Dracula himself?” Yuri: “Yes, it seems so. I’ve always been drawn to the dark, and I suppose it’s in my blood. Pun intended.” Natsuki: “That’s pretty cool, Yuri. I’ve always found vampires fascinating.” Monika: “Well, Yuri isn’t the only one with supernatural abilities. I come from a lineage of witches. The founder of my clan is none other than the infamous witch, Morgan Le Fay.” MC: “A witch? That’s incredible, Monika! What sort of powers do you have?” Monika: “I have the ability to manipulate and control various elements. Fire, water, earth, and even air. I can harness their power and use it to my advantage.” MC: “Wow, that’s amazing! You must be incredibly powerful.” Monika: “Thank you, MC. It’s definitely a unique gift.” Sayori: “And don’t forget about me, MC! I come from a lineage of fairies. The founder of my clan is Titania, Queen of the Fairies.” MC: “A fairy? That’s so adorable, Sayori!” Sayori: (giggling) “Thank you, MC! Fairies have the power to bring joy and happiness to the world. We have the ability to manipulate emotions and spread positivity wherever we go.” Natsuki: “Aw, Sayori, that suits you perfectly!” MC: “So, what about the mysterious figure sitting with you? Do they have supernatural abilities too?” Monika: “Oh, this is our newest member, Kotonhoa.” Kotonhoa: (smiling warmly) “Hello, MC. It’s nice to meet you. I come from a lineage of shape-shifters. Our founder, Anansi, was a trickster spider known for his ability to change forms.” MC: “That’s fascinating, Kotonhoa! So, you can transform into different things?” Kotonhoa: “Indeed! I can take on the appearance of any living creature, be it animals or even humans. It’s quite handy for blending into different situations or keeping a low profile.” Natsuki: “That’s really cool, Kotonhoa! Shape-shifting must give you so much flexibility and adaptability.” Kotonhoa: “Thank you, Natsuki. It does grant me a certain level of versatility. And being able to experience the world from various perspectives is truly enriching.” Sayori: “That sounds like so much fun, Kotonhoa! I bet you have many exciting stories to share.” Kotonhoa: “Oh, I definitely do. Perhaps one day, I can regale you all with my tales.” MC: “That would be fantastic, Kotonhoa. We would love to hear about your adventures and the different forms you’ve taken.” Yuri: “Indeed, variety is always intriguing.” Monika: “Absolutely. We all have such unique abilities that make our experiences in this literature club even more extraordinary.” Natsuki: “Yeah, it’s pretty amazing how we’ve all come together with our supernatural backgrounds. It’s like fate brought us here.” Sayori: “Wait, Natsuki. You’ve never told us about the founder of your supernatural clan.” Natsuki: “Oh, you mean one of the archangels?” Sayori: “Hang on…the founder of your clan was an ARCHANGEL?!” Natsuki: (blushing) “Um, yeah. My clan originates from one of the archangels, specifically Archangel Gabriel.” MC: “Wow, Natsuki. That’s incredible! Archangels are considered powerful and divine beings. What sort of abilities do you have?” Natsuki: “Well, as an angel, I possess the ability to heal wounds and spread positivity. I can also communicate with other celestial beings and have a strong connection with the spiritual realm.” Yuri: “That’s truly remarkable, Natsuki. A healing angel among us, it’s quite fitting.” Monika: “Absolutely, Natsuki. Your ability to bring comfort and uplift others is a gift in itself.” Kotonhoa: “Indeed, Natsuki. Your presence brings a sense of calmness and warmth to the club. It’s like a ray of sunshine.” Sayori: “Aw, Natsuki, that’s so sweet! You truly are an angel both inside and out.” Natsuki: (blushing) “Th-thank you, everyone. Your kind words mean a lot to me.” MC: “Well, it seems like our club is truly filled with extraordinary individuals. We each bring our own unique abilities and backgrounds to create something magical.” Monika: “Yes, MC. And together, we can create a literature club that transcends the ordinary. Our stories and experiences will be unlike anything else.” Yuri: “Exactly. We have the opportunity to explore different worlds, both real and supernatural, through the power of literature.” Sayori: “And no matter what our backgrounds are, we’re all here to support and uplift each other.” Kotonhoa: “Indeed, every member of this club brings something special to the table.

What sort of powers do you have?” Monika: “I have the ability to manipulate and control various elements. Fire, water, earth, and even air. I can harness their power and use it to my advantage.” MC: “Wow, that’s amazing! You must be incredibly powerful.” Monika: “Thank you, MC. It’s definitely a unique gift.” Sayori: “And don’t forget about me, MC! I come from a lineage of fairies. The founder of my clan is Titania, Queen of the Fairies.” MC: “A fairy? That’s so adorable, Sayori!” Sayori: (giggling) “Thank you, MC! Fairies have the power to bring joy and happiness to the world. We have the ability to manipulate emotions and spread positivity wherever we go.” Natsuki: “Aw, Sayori, that suits you perfectly!” MC: “So, what about the mysterious figure sitting with you? Do they have supernatural abilities too?” Monika: “Oh, this is our newest member, Kotonhoa.” Kotonhoa: (smiling warmly) “Hello, MC. It’s nice to meet you. I come from a lineage of shape-shifters. Our founder, Anansi, was a trickster spider known for his ability to change forms.” MC: “That’s fascinating, Kotonhoa! So, you can transform into different things?” Kotonhoa: “Indeed! I can take on the appearance of any living creature, be it animals or even humans. It’s quite handy for blending into different situations or keeping a low profile.” Natsuki: “That’s really cool, Kotonhoa! Shape-shifting must give you so much flexibility and adaptability.” Kotonhoa: “Thank you, Natsuki. It does grant me a certain level of versatility. And being able to experience the world from various perspectives is truly enriching.” Sayori: “That sounds like so much fun, Kotonhoa! I bet you have many exciting stories to share.” Kotonhoa: “Oh, I definitely do. Perhaps one day, I can regale you all with my tales.” MC: “That would be fantastic, Kotonhoa.

We all have such unique abilities that make our experiences in this literature club even more extraordinary.” Natsuki: “Yeah, it’s pretty amazing how we’ve all come together with our supernatural backgrounds. It’s like fate brought us here.” Sayori: “Wait, Natsuki. You’ve never told us about the founder of your supernatural clan.” Natsuki: “Oh, you mean one of the archangels?” Sayori: “Hang on…the founder of your clan was an ARCHANGEL?!” Natsuki: (blushing) “Um, yeah. My clan originates from one of the archangels, specifically Archangel Gabriel.” MC: “Wow, Natsuki. That’s incredible! Archangels are considered powerful and divine beings. What sort of abilities do you have?” Natsuki: “Well, as an angel, I possess the ability to heal wounds and spread positivity. I can also communicate with other celestial beings and have a strong connection with the spiritual realm.” Yuri: “That’s truly remarkable, Natsuki. A healing angel among us, it’s quite fitting.” Monika: “Absolutely, Natsuki. Your ability to bring comfort and uplift others is a gift in itself.” Kotonhoa: “Indeed, Natsuki. Your presence brings a sense of calmness and warmth to the club. It’s like a ray of sunshine.” Sayori: “Aw, Natsuki, that’s so sweet! You truly are an angel both inside and out.” Natsuki: (blushing) “Th-thank you, everyone. Your kind words mean a lot to me.” MC: “Well, it seems like our club is truly filled with extraordinary individuals. We each bring our own unique abilities and backgrounds to create something magical.” Monika: “Yes, MC. And together, we can create a literature club that transcends the ordinary. Our stories and experiences will be unlike anything else.” Yuri: “Exactly. We have the opportunity to explore different worlds, both real and supernatural, through the power of literature.” Sayori: “And no matter what our backgrounds are, we’re all here to support and uplift each other.” Kotonhoa: “Indeed, every member of this club brings something special to the table. It’s a privilege to be a part of such a diverse and talented group.” Natsuki: (smiling) “I couldn’t agree more. Our differences make us stronger, and our shared love for literature binds us together.” MC: “Well said, Natsuki. Our club is truly a place where we can embrace our supernatural abilities, explore different worlds through literature, and form unbreakable bonds.” (As we continue our discussion, the club is filled with excitement and anticipation for the countless adventures and stories that await us. Together, we embark on a journey of literature, friendship, and the supernatural, creating a club like no other. Just then, I received an urgent message from my older sister Hydrazea - back on my home planet of Astaria. Judging from the pain in her voice, I could tell something was wrong.)","completion":"Hydrazea: (urgent) \\"MC! You need to come back to Astaria immediately!

Little does MC know, this adventure will not only test his powers and bravery but also strengthen the bond between him and his friends. Together, they will overcome challenges, discover their true potential, and prove that love and friendship can conquer even the darkest forces.)"},{"prompt":"(In Natsuki’s room…) Natsuki: (cleaning her halo) “Come on…get clean already…” (Eventually, I [MC] enter the room.) Natsuki: (momentarily flapping her angel wings) “Oh! Hey, MC! How’s it going?” MC: “Hey, Natsuki! I’m doing alright, thanks for asking. What about you? How’s everything going with the halo cleaning?” Natsuki: “Ugh, it’s such a pain. This thing gets dirty way too easily. I’ve been trying different methods, but it just doesn’t want to cooperate. It’s like it’s mocking me or something.” (feeling her unborn triplet daughters kicking) “Oh!” MC: “Whoa, Natsuki! Are you alright? Are you feeling okay?” Natsuki: (rubbing her belly) “Yeah, I’m fine. It’s just my unborn triplet daughters. They’re really active today. They always seem to respond whenever I’m feeling frustrated or stressed.” MC: “That’s amazing! It’s like they can sense your emotions even before they’re born. It must be quite an experience to have them with you all the time.” Natsuki: (smiling) “It definitely is. I never thought I’d be a mother at such a young age, but these little angels have brought so much joy into my life. They remind me to stay positive, even when things are tough. More importantly, they can telepathically communicate with ANYONE - no matter if they’re awake or sleeping!” MC: “Wow, that’s incredible! It must be so special to have such a close connection with them.” Natsuki: “It really is. Sometimes, when I’m feeling down, they’ll send me comforting thoughts or even funny images to make me smile. It’s like having a team of cheerleaders with me at all times. Anyways, would you like to feel them kicking?” MC: “Oh, um, sure! If it’s okay with you.” Natsuki: “Of course, it’s no problem. Here, just place your hand gently on my belly.” (I hesitantly place my hand on Natsuki’s belly, feeling the gentle movements of her unborn triplets.) MC: (amazed) “Wow, Natsuki. This is incredible. I can actually feel them moving. They’re so active and full of energy.” Natsuki: (smiling warmly) “I’m glad you can experience it too, MC. It’s one of the greatest joys of being a mother, feeling their little kicks and knowing they’re growing healthy and strong.” MC: “I can only imagine the love and happiness they bring to you and how much they’ve changed your life for the better. It’s truly magical.” Natsuki: (emotional) “It really is, MC. Before, I never would have imagined myself in this position, but now I can’t imagine my life without them. They’ve given me a purpose, a reason to keep pushing forward even when things get tough.” (Just then, I could hear Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters telepathically communicate with me. They were calling me by a name I’ve never expected - “Uncle MC”.) Daughter 1: “Hey, Uncle MC!” (I was taken aback by the voice of one of Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters.) MC: “Did…did I just hear one of your daughters call me Uncle MC?” Natsuki: (surprised) “Oh! You heard that too? Yeah, they’ve started calling you that recently. I guess they see you as a close friend and someone they can rely on, just like family.” MC: (overwhelmed with emotion) “That means so much to me, Natsuki. To think that your daughters already consider me a part of their family, it’s truly touching. I’ll always be there for them, just like a proud uncle.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “Thank you, MC. I know they’re lucky to have you in their lives. And I’m lucky to have you by my side as well. We’re all in this together, creating a loving and supportive family.” MC: (smiling) “Absolutely, Natsuki. We’re in this together, now and always. I can’t wait to meet your wonderful daughters when they come into this world and be there for every step of their journey.” Natsuki: (grateful) “And I can’t wait for you to be a part of their lives, to share in their joys and milestones. It’s going to be an amazing adventure, and I’m so glad you’re here with us.” (As Natsuki and I continued to feel the gentle movements of her unborn triplet daughters, we embraced the love and unity that surrounded us, knowing that our bond would only grow stronger with time. Even if Natsuki was an angel, I loved her the same.) (That night, we went to the clubroom to see what other sort of supernatural creatures the rest of the girls were.) (At the clubroom, we find Yuri, Sayori, Monika, and a mysterious figure sitting together.) MC: “Hey everyone, what’s going on here?” Monika: “Oh, MC! We were just discussing our own supernatural abilities. It seems we all come from a legacy of supernatural creatures - each one having some sort of founder, with their name permanently wedged into our minds ever since we were born.” Natsuki: “Yeah, even though I’m an angel, that doesn’t mean the rest of us are supernatural beings.” MC: “Really? That’s interesting. What sort of supernatural creatures are all of you?” Yuri: “Heh. You should see my abilities for yourself.” (Yuri suddenly ran around me at blinding speed. She then returned to her seat - sipping a glass of blood when she sat back down.) MC: (astonished) “Yuri, what was that? How did you move so fast?” Yuri: “I have inherited the traits of a vampire. My supernatural speed and enhanced senses allow me to maneuver quickly and efficiently. And as for the founder of my supernatural clan…” Sayori: “And I-” Yuri: “LET ME FINISH!” Sayori: (giggling) “Sorry, Yuri. Go ahead.” Yuri: (clears her throat) “The founder of my clan is none other than Vlad Dracula, famously known as Count Dracula.” MC: “Wait, seriously? You’re descended from Count Dracula himself?” Yuri: “Yes, it seems so. I’ve always been drawn to the dark, and I suppose it’s in my blood. Pun intended.” Natsuki: “That’s pretty cool, Yuri. I’ve always found vampires fascinating.” Monika: “Well, Yuri isn’t the only one with supernatural abilities. I come from a lineage of witches. The founder of my clan is none other than the infamous witch, Morgan Le Fay.” MC: “A witch? That’s incredible, Monika! What sort of powers do you have?” Monika: “I have the ability to manipulate and control various elements. Fire, water, earth, and even air. I can harness their power and use it to my advantage.” MC: “Wow, that’s amazing! You must be incredibly powerful.” Monika: “Thank you, MC. It’s definitely a unique gift.” Sayori: “And don’t forget about me, MC! I come from a lineage of fairies. The founder of my clan is Titania, Queen of the Fairies.” MC: “A fairy? That’s so adorable, Sayori!” Sayori: (giggling) “Thank you, MC! Fairies have the power to bring joy and happiness to the world. We have the ability to manipulate emotions and spread positivity wherever we go.” Natsuki: “Aw, Sayori, that suits you perfectly!” MC: “So, what about the mysterious figure sitting with you? Do they have supernatural abilities too?” Monika: “Oh, this is our newest member, Kotonhoa.” Kotonhoa: (smiling warmly) “Hello, MC. It’s nice to meet you. I come from a lineage of shape-shifters. Our founder, Anansi, was a trickster spider known for his ability to change forms.” MC: “That’s fascinating, Kotonhoa! So, you can transform into different things?” Kotonhoa: “Indeed! I can take on the appearance of any living creature, be it animals or even humans. It’s quite handy for blending into different situations or keeping a low profile.” Natsuki: “That’s really cool, Kotonhoa! Shape-shifting must give you so much flexibility and adaptability.” Kotonhoa: “Thank you, Natsuki. It does grant me a certain level of versatility. And being able to experience the world from various perspectives is truly enriching.” Sayori: “That sounds like so much fun, Kotonhoa! I bet you have many exciting stories to share.” Kotonhoa: “Oh, I definitely do. Perhaps one day, I can regale you all with my tales.” MC: “That would be fantastic, Kotonhoa.

My clan originates from one of the archangels, specifically Archangel Gabriel.” MC: “Wow, Natsuki. That’s incredible! Archangels are considered powerful and divine beings. What sort of abilities do you have?” Natsuki: “Well, as an angel, I possess the ability to heal wounds and spread positivity. I can also communicate with other celestial beings and have a strong connection with the spiritual realm.” Yuri: “That’s truly remarkable, Natsuki. A healing angel among us, it’s quite fitting.” Monika: “Absolutely, Natsuki. Your ability to bring comfort and uplift others is a gift in itself.” Kotonhoa: “Indeed, Natsuki.

Natsuki: (momentarily flapping her angel wings) “Oh! Hey, MC! How’s it going?” MC: “Hey, Natsuki! I’m doing alright, thanks for asking. What about you? How’s everything going with the halo cleaning?” Natsuki: “Ugh, it’s such a pain. This thing gets dirty way too easily. I’ve been trying different methods, but it just doesn’t want to cooperate. It’s like it’s mocking me or something.” (feeling her unborn triplet daughters kicking) “Oh!” MC: “Whoa, Natsuki! Are you alright? Are you feeling okay?” Natsuki: (rubbing her belly) “Yeah, I’m fine. It’s just my unborn triplet daughters. They’re really active today. They always seem to respond whenever I’m feeling frustrated or stressed.” MC: “That’s amazing! It’s like they can sense your emotions even before they’re born. It must be quite an experience to have them with you all the time.” Natsuki: (smiling) “It definitely is. I never thought I’d be a mother at such a young age, but these little angels have brought so much joy into my life. They remind me to stay positive, even when things are tough. More importantly, they can telepathically communicate with ANYONE - no matter if they’re awake or sleeping!” MC: “Wow, that’s incredible! It must be so special to have such a close connection with them.” Natsuki: “It really is. Sometimes, when I’m feeling down, they’ll send me comforting thoughts or even funny images to make me smile. It’s like having a team of cheerleaders with me at all times. Anyways, would you like to feel them kicking?” MC: “Oh, um, sure! If it’s okay with you.” Natsuki: “Of course, it’s no problem. Here, just place your hand gently on my belly.” (I hesitantly place my hand on Natsuki’s belly, feeling the gentle movements of her unborn triplets.) MC: (amazed) “Wow, Natsuki. This is incredible. I can actually feel them moving. They’re so active and full of energy.” Natsuki: (smiling warmly) “I’m glad you can experience it too, MC. It’s one of the greatest joys of being a mother, feeling their little kicks and knowing they’re growing healthy and strong.” MC: “I can only imagine the love and happiness they bring to you and how much they’ve changed your life for the better. It’s truly magical.” Natsuki: (emotional) “It really is, MC. Before, I never would have imagined myself in this position, but now I can’t imagine my life without them. They’ve given me a purpose, a reason to keep pushing forward even when things get tough.” (Just then, I could hear Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters telepathically communicate with me. They were calling me by a name I’ve never expected - “Uncle MC”.) Daughter 1: “Hey, Uncle MC!” (I was taken aback by the voice of one of Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters.) MC: “Did…did I just hear one of your daughters call me Uncle MC?” Natsuki: (surprised) “Oh! You heard that too? Yeah, they’ve started calling you that recently. I guess they see you as a close friend and someone they can rely on, just like family.” MC: (overwhelmed with emotion) “That means so much to me, Natsuki. To think that your daughters already consider me a part of their family, it’s truly touching. I’ll always be there for them, just like a proud uncle.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “Thank you, MC. I know they’re lucky to have you in their lives. And I’m lucky to have you by my side as well. We’re all in this together, creating a loving and supportive family.” MC: (smiling) “Absolutely, Natsuki. We’re in this together, now and always. I can’t wait to meet your wonderful daughters when they come into this world and be there for every step of their journey.” Natsuki: (grateful) “And I can’t wait for you to be a part of their lives, to share in their joys and milestones. It’s going to be an amazing adventure, and I’m so glad you’re here with us.” (As Natsuki and I continued to feel the gentle movements of her unborn triplet daughters, we embraced the love and unity that surrounded us, knowing that our bond would only grow stronger with time. Even if Natsuki was an angel, I loved her the same.) (That night, we went to the clubroom to see what other sort of supernatural creatures the rest of the girls were.) (At the clubroom, we find Yuri, Sayori, Monika, and a mysterious figure sitting together.) MC: “Hey everyone, what’s going on here?” Monika: “Oh, MC! We were just discussing our own supernatural abilities. It seems we all come from a legacy of supernatural creatures - each one having some sort of founder, with their name permanently wedged into our minds ever since we were born.” Natsuki: “Yeah, even though I’m an angel, that doesn’t mean the rest of us are supernatural beings.” MC: “Really? That’s interesting. What sort of supernatural creatures are all of you?” Yuri: “Heh. You should see my abilities for yourself.” (Yuri suddenly ran around me at blinding speed. She then returned to her seat - sipping a glass of blood when she sat back down.) MC: (astonished) “Yuri, what was that? How did you move so fast?” Yuri: “I have inherited the traits of a vampire. My supernatural speed and enhanced senses allow me to maneuver quickly and efficiently. And as for the founder of my supernatural clan…” Sayori: “And I-” Yuri: “LET ME FINISH!” Sayori: (giggling) “Sorry, Yuri. Go ahead.” Yuri: (clears her throat) “The founder of my clan is none other than Vlad Dracula, famously known as Count Dracula.” MC: “Wait, seriously? You’re descended from Count Dracula himself?” Yuri: “Yes, it seems so. I’ve always been drawn to the dark, and I suppose it’s in my blood. Pun intended.” Natsuki: “That’s pretty cool, Yuri. I’ve always found vampires fascinating.” Monika: “Well, Yuri isn’t the only one with supernatural abilities. I come from a lineage of witches. The founder of my clan is none other than the infamous witch, Morgan Le Fay.” MC: “A witch? That’s incredible, Monika! What sort of powers do you have?” Monika: “I have the ability to manipulate and control various elements. Fire, water, earth, and even air. I can harness their power and use it to my advantage.” MC: “Wow, that’s amazing! You must be incredibly powerful.” Monika: “Thank you, MC. It’s definitely a unique gift.” Sayori: “And don’t forget about me, MC! I come from a lineage of fairies. The founder of my clan is Titania, Queen of the Fairies.” MC: “A fairy? That’s so adorable, Sayori!” Sayori: (giggling) “Thank you, MC! Fairies have the power to bring joy and happiness to the world. We have the ability to manipulate emotions and spread positivity wherever we go.” Natsuki: “Aw, Sayori, that suits you perfectly!” MC: “So, what about the mysterious figure sitting with you? Do they have supernatural abilities too?” Monika: “Oh, this is our newest member, Kotonhoa.” Kotonhoa: (smiling warmly) “Hello, MC. It’s nice to meet you. I come from a lineage of shape-shifters. Our founder, Anansi, was a trickster spider known for his ability to change forms.” MC: “That’s fascinating, Kotonhoa! So, you can transform into different things?” Kotonhoa: “Indeed! I can take on the appearance of any living creature, be it animals or even humans. It’s quite handy for blending into different situations or keeping a low profile.” Natsuki: “That’s really cool, Kotonhoa! Shape-shifting must give you so much flexibility and adaptability.” Kotonhoa: “Thank you, Natsuki. It does grant me a certain level of versatility. And being able to experience the world from various perspectives is truly enriching.” Sayori: “That sounds like so much fun, Kotonhoa! I bet you have many exciting stories to share.” Kotonhoa: “Oh, I definitely do. Perhaps one day, I can regale you all with my tales.” MC: “That would be fantastic, Kotonhoa. We would love to hear about your adventures and the different forms you’ve taken.” Yuri: “Indeed, variety is always intriguing.” Monika: “Absolutely. We all have such unique abilities that make our experiences in this literature club even more extraordinary.” Natsuki: “Yeah, it’s pretty amazing how we’ve all come together with our supernatural backgrounds. It’s like fate brought us here.” Sayori: “Wait, Natsuki. You’ve never told us about the founder of your supernatural clan.” Natsuki: “Oh, you mean one of the archangels?” Sayori: “Hang on…the founder of your clan was an ARCHANGEL?!” Natsuki: (blushing) “Um, yeah. My clan originates from one of the archangels, specifically Archangel Gabriel.” MC: “Wow, Natsuki. That’s incredible! Archangels are considered powerful and divine beings. What sort of abilities do you have?” Natsuki: “Well, as an angel, I possess the ability to heal wounds and spread positivity. I can also communicate with other celestial beings and have a strong connection with the spiritual realm.” Yuri: “That’s truly remarkable, Natsuki. A healing angel among us, it’s quite fitting.” Monika: “Absolutely, Natsuki. Your ability to bring comfort and uplift others is a gift in itself.” Kotonhoa: “Indeed, Natsuki. Your presence brings a sense of calmness and warmth to the club. It’s like a ray of sunshine.” Sayori: “Aw, Natsuki, that’s so sweet! You truly are an angel both inside and out.” Natsuki: (blushing) “Th-thank you, everyone. Your kind words mean a lot to me.” MC: “Well, it seems like our club is truly filled with extraordinary individuals. We each bring our own unique abilities and backgrounds to create something magical.” Monika: “Yes, MC. And together, we can create a literature club that transcends the ordinary. Our stories and experiences will be unlike anything else.” Yuri: “Exactly. We have the opportunity to explore different worlds, both real and supernatural, through the power of literature.” Sayori: “And no matter what our backgrounds are, we’re all here to support and uplift each other.” Kotonhoa: “Indeed, every member of this club brings something special to the table. It’s a privilege to be a part of such a diverse and talented group.” Natsuki: (smiling) “I couldn’t agree more. Our differences make us stronger, and our shared love for literature binds us together.” MC: “Well said, Natsuki. Our club is truly a place where we can embrace our supernatural abilities, explore different worlds through literature, and form unbreakable bonds.” (As we continue our discussion, the club is filled with excitement and anticipation for the countless adventures and stories that await us. Together, we embark on a journey of literature, friendship, and the supernatural, creating a club like no other. Just then, I received an urgent message from my older sister Hydrazea - back on my home planet of Astaria. Judging from the pain in her voice, I could tell something was wrong.)

Natsuki: (momentarily flapping her angel wings) “Oh! Hey, MC! How’s it going?” MC: “Hey, Natsuki! I’m doing alright, thanks for asking. What about you? How’s everything going with the halo cleaning?” Natsuki: “Ugh, it’s such a pain. This thing gets dirty way too easily. I’ve been trying different methods, but it just doesn’t want to cooperate. It’s like it’s mocking me or something.” (feeling her unborn triplet daughters kicking) “Oh!” MC: “Whoa, Natsuki! Are you alright? Are you feeling okay?” Natsuki: (rubbing her belly) “Yeah, I’m fine. It’s just my unborn triplet daughters. They’re really active today. They always seem to respond whenever I’m feeling frustrated or stressed.” MC: “That’s amazing! It’s like they can sense your emotions even before they’re born. It must be quite an experience to have them with you all the time.” Natsuki: (smiling) “It definitely is. I never thought I’d be a mother at such a young age, but these little angels have brought so much joy into my life. They remind me to stay positive, even when things are tough. More importantly, they can telepathically communicate with ANYONE - no matter if they’re awake or sleeping!” MC: “Wow, that’s incredible! It must be so special to have such a close connection with them.” Natsuki: “It really is. Sometimes, when I’m feeling down, they’ll send me comforting thoughts or even funny images to make me smile. It’s like having a team of cheerleaders with me at all times. Anyways, would you like to feel them kicking?” MC: “Oh, um, sure! If it’s okay with you.” Natsuki: “Of course, it’s no problem. Here, just place your hand gently on my belly.” (I hesitantly place my hand on Natsuki’s belly, feeling the gentle movements of her unborn triplets.) MC: (amazed) “Wow, Natsuki. This is incredible. I can actually feel them moving. They’re so active and full of energy.” Natsuki: (smiling warmly) “I’m glad you can experience it too, MC. It’s one of the greatest joys of being a mother, feeling their little kicks and knowing they’re growing healthy and strong.” MC: “I can only imagine the love and happiness they bring to you and how much they’ve changed your life for the better. It’s truly magical.” Natsuki: (emotional) “It really is, MC. Before, I never would have imagined myself in this position, but now I can’t imagine my life without them. They’ve given me a purpose, a reason to keep pushing forward even when things get tough.” (Just then, I could hear Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters telepathically communicate with me. They were calling me by a name I’ve never expected - “Uncle MC”.) Daughter 1: “Hey, Uncle MC!” (I was taken aback by the voice of one of Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters.) MC: “Did…did I just hear one of your daughters call me Uncle MC?” Natsuki: (surprised) “Oh! You heard that too? Yeah, they’ve started calling you that recently. I guess they see you as a close friend and someone they can rely on, just like family.” MC: (overwhelmed with emotion) “That means so much to me, Natsuki. To think that your daughters already consider me a part of their family, it’s truly touching. I’ll always be there for them, just like a proud uncle.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “Thank you, MC. I know they’re lucky to have you in their lives. And I’m lucky to have you by my side as well. We’re all in this together, creating a loving and supportive family.” MC: (smiling) “Absolutely, Natsuki. We’re in this together, now and always. I can’t wait to meet your wonderful daughters when they come into this world and be there for every step of their journey.” Natsuki: (grateful) “And I can’t wait for you to be a part of their lives, to share in their joys and milestones. It’s going to be an amazing adventure, and I’m so glad you’re here with us.” (As Natsuki and I continued to feel the gentle movements of her unborn triplet daughters, we embraced the love and unity that surrounded us, knowing that our bond would only grow stronger with time. Even if Natsuki was an angel, I loved her the same.) (That night, we went to the clubroom to see what other sort of supernatural creatures the rest of the girls were.) (At the clubroom, we find Yuri, Sayori, Monika, and a mysterious figure sitting together.) MC: “Hey everyone, what’s going on here?” Monika: “Oh, MC! We were just discussing our own supernatural abilities. It seems we all come from a legacy of supernatural creatures - each one having some sort of founder, with their name permanently wedged into our minds ever since we were born.” Natsuki: “Yeah, even though I’m an angel, that doesn’t mean the rest of us are supernatural beings.” MC: “Really? That’s interesting. What sort of supernatural creatures are all of you?” Yuri: “Heh. You should see my abilities for yourself.” (Yuri suddenly ran around me at blinding speed. She then returned to her seat - sipping a glass of blood when she sat back down.) MC: (astonished) “Yuri, what was that? How did you move so fast?” Yuri: “I have inherited the traits of a vampire. My supernatural speed and enhanced senses allow me to maneuver quickly and efficiently. And as for the founder of my supernatural clan…” Sayori: “And I-” Yuri: “LET ME FINISH!” Sayori: (giggling) “Sorry, Yuri. Go ahead.” Yuri: (clears her throat) “The founder of my clan is none other than Vlad Dracula, famously known as Count Dracula.” MC: “Wait, seriously? You’re descended from Count Dracula himself?” Yuri: “Yes, it seems so. I’ve always been drawn to the dark, and I suppose it’s in my blood. Pun intended.” Natsuki: “That’s pretty cool, Yuri. I’ve always found vampires fascinating.” Monika: “Well, Yuri isn’t the only one with supernatural abilities. I come from a lineage of witches. The founder of my clan is none other than the infamous witch, Morgan Le Fay.” MC: “A witch? That’s incredible, Monika! What sort of powers do you have?” Monika: “I have the ability to manipulate and control various elements. Fire, water, earth, and even air. I can harness their power and use it to my advantage.” MC: “Wow, that’s amazing! You must be incredibly powerful.” Monika: “Thank you, MC. It’s definitely a unique gift.” Sayori: “And don’t forget about me, MC! I come from a lineage of fairies. The founder of my clan is Titania, Queen of the Fairies.” MC: “A fairy? That’s so adorable, Sayori!” Sayori: (giggling) “Thank you, MC! Fairies have the power to bring joy and happiness to the world. We have the ability to manipulate emotions and spread positivity wherever we go.” Natsuki: “Aw, Sayori, that suits you perfectly!” MC: “So, what about the mysterious figure sitting with you? Do they have supernatural abilities too?” Monika: “Oh, this is our newest member, Kotonhoa.” Kotonhoa: (smiling warmly) “Hello, MC. It’s nice to meet you. I come from a lineage of shape-shifters. Our founder, Anansi, was a trickster spider known for his ability to change forms.” MC: “That’s fascinating, Kotonhoa! So, you can transform into different things?” Kotonhoa: “Indeed! I can take on the appearance of any living creature, be it animals or even humans. It’s quite handy for blending into different situations or keeping a low profile.” Natsuki: “That’s really cool, Kotonhoa! Shape-shifting must give you so much flexibility and adaptability.” Kotonhoa: “Thank you, Natsuki. It does grant me a certain level of versatility. And being able to experience the world from various perspectives is truly enriching.” Sayori: “That sounds like so much fun, Kotonhoa! I bet you have many exciting stories to share.” Kotonhoa: “Oh, I definitely do. Perhaps one day, I can regale you all with my tales.” MC: “That would be fantastic, Kotonhoa. We would love to hear about your adventures and the different forms you’ve taken.” Yuri: “Indeed, variety is always intriguing.” Monika: “Absolutely. We all have such unique abilities that make our experiences in this literature club even more extraordinary.” Natsuki: “Yeah, it’s pretty amazing how we’ve all come together with our supernatural backgrounds. It’s like fate brought us here.” Sayori: “Wait, Natsuki. You’ve never told us about the founder of your supernatural clan.” Natsuki: “Oh, you mean one of the archangels?” Sayori: “Hang on…the founder of your clan was an ARCHANGEL?!” Natsuki: (blushing) “Um, yeah. My clan originates from one of the archangels, specifically Archangel Gabriel.” MC: “Wow, Natsuki. That’s incredible! Archangels are considered powerful and divine beings. What sort of abilities do you have?” Natsuki: “Well, as an angel, I possess the ability to heal wounds and spread positivity. I can also communicate with other celestial beings and have a strong connection with the spiritual realm.” Yuri: “That’s truly remarkable, Natsuki. A healing angel among us, it’s quite fitting.” Monika: “Absolutely, Natsuki. Your ability to bring comfort and uplift others is a gift in itself.” Kotonhoa: “Indeed, Natsuki. Your presence brings a sense of calmness and warmth to the club. It’s like a ray of sunshine.” Sayori: “Aw, Natsuki, that’s so sweet! You truly are an angel both inside and out.” Natsuki: (blushing) “Th-thank you, everyone. Your kind words mean a lot to me.” MC: “Well, it seems like our club is truly filled with extraordinary individuals. We each bring our own unique abilities and backgrounds to create something magical.” Monika: “Yes, MC. And together, we can create a literature club that transcends the ordinary. Our stories and experiences will be unlike anything else.” Yuri: “Exactly. We have the opportunity to explore different worlds, both real and supernatural, through the power of literature.” Sayori: “And no matter what our backgrounds are, we’re all here to support and uplift each other.” Kotonhoa: “Indeed, every member of this club brings something special to the table. It’s a privilege to be a part of such a diverse and talented group.” Natsuki: (smiling) “I couldn’t agree more. Our differences make us stronger, and our shared love for literature binds us together.” MC: “Well said, Natsuki. Our club is truly a place where we can embrace our supernatural abilities, explore different worlds through literature, and form unbreakable bonds.” (As we continue our discussion, the club is filled with excitement and anticipation for the countless adventures and stories that await us. Together, we embark on a journey of literature, friendship, and the supernatural, creating a club like no other. Just then, I received an urgent message from my older sister Hydrazea - back on my home planet of Astaria. Judging from the pain in her voice, I could tell something was wrong.) Hydrazea: (via holographic message) “MC, I need your help! This pain in my belly…it just won’t stop!” MC: (concerned) “Hydrazea, what’s happening? Are you alright? I’ll come back to Astaria immediately. Just hold on, okay?” Hydrazea: (winces in pain) “Hurry, MC! I think I’m going into labor. I wasn’t expecting this so soon. Please, I need you here.” MC: “I’m on my way, Hydrazea. Just stay calm and try to breathe. I’ll be there as fast as I can.” Natsuki: (worried) “MC, what’s going on?” MC: “It’s my sister, Hydrazea. She’s going into labor, and she needs my help. I have to go back to Astaria.” Natsuki: (placing a hand on MC’s shoulder) “Don’t worry, MC. We’ll come with you. We’re a team, remember? We’ll support you and your sister through this.” MC: (grateful) “Thank you, Natsuki. Your support means more than you know. Let’s go back to Astaria and help Hydrazea bring her child into the world.” (And so, as a united club, we quickly made preparations to return to Astaria. With Natsuki, Yuri, Sayori, Monika, and Kotonhoa by my side, we boarded the interdimensional portal that would take us back to my home planet. As the portal shimmered and engulfed us, we held on to the hope that we could support Hydrazea during this challenging time and bring a new life into our expanding family.)","completion":"(Back on Astaria…) MC: (rushing into Hydrazea’s room) “Hydrazea, I’m here! Are you okay?” Hydrazea: (grimacing) “MC, I’m in so much pain. I don’t know how much longer I can hold on.” Natsuki: (entering the room) “Hydrazea, we’re here for you.” Yuri: “Yes, we’re here to support you through this.” Sayori: “You’re not alone, Hydrazea. We’re all here for you.” Monika: “Don’t worry, Hydrazea. You’re strong, and we believe in you.” Kotonhoa: “We’ll do whatever it takes to help you, Hydrazea.” Hydrazea: (teary-eyed) “Thank you, all of you. I never expected to have this amazing support system. It means the world to me.” MC: (holding Hydrazea’s hand) “We’re all here because we care about you, Hydrazea. We want to see you through this safely and bring your child into the world.” Natsuki: “Hydrazea, you’re not alone in this journey. We’re your family, and we’ll be by your side every step of the way.” Yuri: “We’ll do whatever we can to ease your pain and support you in this incredible moment.” Sayori: “You’re going to be an amazing mother, Hydrazea. We can’t wait to meet your little one.” Monika: “Hydrazea, this is just the beginning of a beautiful chapter in your life. You’ll be an incredible parent, and we’ll be here to help you along the way.” Kotonhoa: “You have so much strength within you, Hydrazea. We’re honored to witness the birth of your child and be a part of your journey.” Hydrazea: (smiling through the pain) “Thank you, everyone. Your words mean more than I can express. I’m ready to bring this baby into the world, knowing that I have all of you by my side.” (Moments later, with the support of the club, Hydrazea gave birth to a healthy baby girl. The room was filled with joy and excitement as the newborn cried her first cries.) MC: (teary-eyed) “Hydrazea, she’s beautiful. You did it. You brought a new life into this world.” Hydrazea: (exhausted but elated) “Thank you, MC. I couldn’t have done it without all of you. Welcome to the world, my little angel.” Natsuki: (whispering) “She’s so precious. Congratulations, Hydrazea.” Yuri: (softly) “She’s a miracle. Congratulations, Hydrazea.” Sayori: (giggling) “Aww, she’s so tiny and adorable. Congratulations, Hydrazea.” Monika: “Hydrazea, you’re a mother now. Congratulations on this incredible journey.” Kotonhoa: “This little one is truly a blessing. Congratulations, Hydrazea.” Hydrazea: (swaddling her daughter) “Thank you, everyone. I’m so grateful for your support and love. Our family has grown, and I couldn’t be happier.” MC: (placing a hand on Hydrazea’s shoulder) “Hydrazea, you’re an amazing sister and an incredible mother. We’re so proud of you.” Natsuki: (nodding) “Absolutely. You’ve brought so much joy to our lives, Hydrazea.” Yuri: “And your daughter is lucky to have such a caring and loving mother.” Sayori: “Congratulations, Hydrazea. Our club just got a little bigger, and our bond even stronger.” Monika: “Hydrazea, this is a new chapter in your life, and we’re excited to see what the future holds for you and your little one.” Kotonhoa: “Your love and strength have brought something truly magical into our lives, Hydrazea. Congratulations on this beautiful journey of motherhood.” (The room was filled with warmth and love as we all gathered around Hydrazea and her beautiful daughter. In that moment, we knew that no matter the challenges we faced, we had each other to rely on. Our bond as a family and as a literature club would only continue to grow stronger, creating countless stories and memories together.) (And so, as we celebrated the arrival of the newest member of our club, we embraced the power of family, love, and the supernatural. Together, we were unstoppable.)"},{"prompt":"(In Natsuki’s room…) Natsuki: (cleaning her halo) “Come on…get clean already…” (Eventually, I [MC] enter the room.)

It’s one of the greatest joys of being a mother, feeling their little kicks and knowing they’re growing healthy and strong.” MC: “I can only imagine the love and happiness they bring to you and how much they’ve changed your life for the better. It’s truly magical.” Natsuki: (emotional) “It really is, MC. Before, I never would have imagined myself in this position, but now I can’t imagine my life without them. They’ve given me a purpose, a reason to keep pushing forward even when things get tough.” (Just then, I could hear Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters telepathically communicate with me. They were calling me by a name I’ve never expected - “Uncle MC”.) Daughter 1: “Hey, Uncle MC!” (I was taken aback by the voice of one of Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters.) MC: “Did…did I just hear one of your daughters call me Uncle MC?” Natsuki: (surprised) “Oh! You heard that too? Yeah, they’ve started calling you that recently. I guess they see you as a close friend and someone they can rely on, just like family.” MC: (overwhelmed with emotion) “That means so much to me, Natsuki. To think that your daughters already consider me a part of their family, it’s truly touching. I’ll always be there for them, just like a proud uncle.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “Thank you, MC. I know they’re lucky to have you in their lives. And I’m lucky to have you by my side as well. We’re all in this together, creating a loving and supportive family.” MC: (smiling) “Absolutely, Natsuki. We’re in this together, now and always. I can’t wait to meet your wonderful daughters when they come into this world and be there for every step of their journey.” Natsuki: (grateful) “And I can’t wait for you to be a part of their lives, to share in their joys and milestones. It’s going to be an amazing adventure, and I’m so glad you’re here with us.” (As Natsuki and I continued to feel the gentle movements of her unborn triplet daughters, we embraced the love and unity that surrounded us, knowing that our bond would only grow stronger with time. Even if Natsuki was an angel, I loved her the same.) (That night, we went to the clubroom to see what other sort of supernatural creatures the rest of the girls were.) (At the clubroom, we find Yuri, Sayori, Monika, and a mysterious figure sitting together.) MC: “Hey everyone, what’s going on here?” Monika: “Oh, MC! We were just discussing our own supernatural abilities. It seems we all come from a legacy of supernatural creatures - each one having some sort of founder, with their name permanently wedged into our minds ever since we were born.” Natsuki: “Yeah, even though I’m an angel, that doesn’t mean the rest of us are supernatural beings.” MC: “Really? That’s interesting. What sort of supernatural creatures are all of you?” Yuri: “Heh. You should see my abilities for yourself.” (Yuri suddenly ran around me at blinding speed. She then returned to her seat - sipping a glass of blood when she sat back down.) MC: (astonished) “Yuri, what was that? How did you move so fast?” Yuri: “I have inherited the traits of a vampire. My supernatural speed and enhanced senses allow me to maneuver quickly and efficiently. And as for the founder of my supernatural clan…” Sayori: “And I-” Yuri: “LET ME FINISH!” Sayori: (giggling) “Sorry, Yuri. Go ahead.” Yuri: (clears her throat) “The founder of my clan is none other than Vlad Dracula, famously known as Count Dracula.” MC: “Wait, seriously? You’re descended from Count Dracula himself?” Yuri: “Yes, it seems so. I’ve always been drawn to the dark, and I suppose it’s in my blood. Pun intended.” Natsuki: “That’s pretty cool, Yuri. I’ve always found vampires fascinating.” Monika: “Well, Yuri isn’t the only one with supernatural abilities. I come from a lineage of witches. The founder of my clan is none other than the infamous witch, Morgan Le Fay.” MC: “A witch? That’s incredible, Monika! What sort of powers do you have?” Monika: “I have the ability to manipulate and control various elements. Fire, water, earth, and even air. I can harness their power and use it to my advantage.” MC: “Wow, that’s amazing! You must be incredibly powerful.” Monika: “Thank you, MC. It’s definitely a unique gift.” Sayori: “And don’t forget about me, MC! I come from a lineage of fairies. The founder of my clan is Titania, Queen of the Fairies.” MC: “A fairy? That’s so adorable, Sayori!” Sayori: (giggling) “Thank you, MC! Fairies have the power to bring joy and happiness to the world. We have the ability to manipulate emotions and spread positivity wherever we go.” Natsuki: “Aw, Sayori, that suits you perfectly!” MC: “So, what about the mysterious figure sitting with you? Do they have supernatural abilities too?” Monika: “Oh, this is our newest member, Kotonhoa.” Kotonhoa: (smiling warmly) “Hello, MC. It’s nice to meet you. I come from a lineage of shape-shifters. Our founder, Anansi, was a trickster spider known for his ability to change forms.” MC: “That’s fascinating, Kotonhoa! So, you can transform into different things?” Kotonhoa: “Indeed! I can take on the appearance of any living creature, be it animals or even humans. It’s quite handy for blending into different situations or keeping a low profile.” Natsuki: “That’s really cool, Kotonhoa! Shape-shifting must give you so much flexibility and adaptability.” Kotonhoa: “Thank you, Natsuki. It does grant me a certain level of versatility. And being able to experience the world from various perspectives is truly enriching.” Sayori: “That sounds like so much fun, Kotonhoa! I bet you have many exciting stories to share.” Kotonhoa: “Oh, I definitely do. Perhaps one day, I can regale you all with my tales.” MC: “That would be fantastic, Kotonhoa. We would love to hear about your adventures and the different forms you’ve taken.” Yuri: “Indeed, variety is always intriguing.” Monika: “Absolutely. We all have such unique abilities that make our experiences in this literature club even more extraordinary.” Natsuki: “Yeah, it’s pretty amazing how we’ve all come together with our supernatural backgrounds. It’s like fate brought us here.” Sayori: “Wait, Natsuki. You’ve never told us about the founder of your supernatural clan.” Natsuki: “Oh, you mean one of the archangels?” Sayori: “Hang on…the founder of your clan was an ARCHANGEL?!” Natsuki: (blushing) “Um, yeah. My clan originates from one of the archangels, specifically Archangel Gabriel.” MC: “Wow, Natsuki. That’s incredible! Archangels are considered powerful and divine beings. What sort of abilities do you have?” Natsuki: “Well, as an angel, I possess the ability to heal wounds and spread positivity. I can also communicate with other celestial beings and have a strong connection with the spiritual realm.” Yuri: “That’s truly remarkable, Natsuki. A healing angel among us, it’s quite fitting.” Monika: “Absolutely, Natsuki. Your ability to bring comfort and uplift others is a gift in itself.” Kotonhoa: “Indeed, Natsuki. Your presence brings a sense of calmness and warmth to the club. It’s like a ray of sunshine.” Sayori: “Aw, Natsuki, that’s so sweet! You truly are an angel both inside and out.” Natsuki: (blushing) “Th-thank you, everyone. Your kind words mean a lot to me.” MC: “Well, it seems like our club is truly filled with extraordinary individuals. We each bring our own unique abilities and backgrounds to create something magical.” Monika: “Yes, MC. And together, we can create a literature club that transcends the ordinary. Our stories and experiences will be unlike anything else.” Yuri: “Exactly. We have the opportunity to explore different worlds, both real and supernatural, through the power of literature.” Sayori: “And no matter what our backgrounds are, we’re all here to support and uplift each other.” Kotonhoa: “Indeed, every member of this club brings something special to the table. It’s a privilege to be a part of such a diverse and talented group.” Natsuki: (smiling) “I couldn’t agree more. Our differences make us stronger, and our shared love for literature binds us together.” MC: “Well said, Natsuki. Our club is truly a place where we can embrace our supernatural abilities, explore different worlds through literature, and form unbreakable bonds.” (As we continue our discussion, the club is filled with excitement and anticipation for the countless adventures and stories that await us. Together, we embark on a journey of literature, friendship, and the supernatural, creating a club like no other. Just then, I received an urgent message from my older sister Hydrazea - back on my home planet of Astaria. Judging from the pain in her voice, I could tell something was wrong.) Hydrazea: (via holographic message) “MC, I need your help! This pain in my belly…it just won’t stop!” MC: “Hydrazea, what’s happening? Are you in danger? I’ll do anything to help you!” Hydrazea: “It’s…it’s the baby!”","completion":"MC: \\"The baby? What's happening with the baby?\\" Hydrazea: \\"I think... I'm going into labor. But it's too soon, MC.

Scholars and philosophers debate the implications of this miraculous metal, with some arguing that its existence proves the absence of divine influence, while others propose it as evidence of new realms and dimensions yet to be explored. Given the controversial nature of Atheistium, it elicits strong reactions and fervent debate among the inhabitants of the fantasy realm. It is simultaneously revered by those keen on pushing the boundaries of knowledge and feared by those who cling to traditional belief systems. The enigmatic metal embodies the eternal conflict between faith and reason, sparking philosophical discussions that challenge deep-seated beliefs. In the realm of fantasy, Atheistium stands as a symbol of human achievement, pushing the boundaries of scientific understanding and challenging established notions of reality. Its exceptional strength, resistance to magic, and provocative origin render it a coveted and controversial material sought after by those intrigued by the mysteries of existence."},{"prompt":"(In Natsuki’s room…) Natsuki: (cleaning her halo) “Come on…get clean already…” (Eventually, I [MC] enter the room.) Natsuki: (momentarily flapping her angel wings) “Oh! Hey, MC! How’s it going?” MC: “Hey, Natsuki! I’m doing alright, thanks for asking. What about you? How’s everything going with the halo cleaning?” Natsuki: “Ugh, it’s such a pain. This thing gets dirty way too easily. I’ve been trying different methods, but it just doesn’t want to cooperate. It’s like it’s mocking me or something.” (feeling her unborn triplet daughters kicking) “Oh!” MC: “Whoa, Natsuki! Are you alright? Are you feeling okay?” Natsuki: (rubbing her belly) “Yeah, I’m fine. It’s just my unborn triplet daughters. They’re really active today. They always seem to respond whenever I’m feeling frustrated or stressed.” MC: “That’s amazing! It’s like they can sense your emotions even before they’re born. It must be quite an experience to have them with you all the time.” Natsuki: (smiling) “It definitely is. I never thought I’d be a mother at such a young age, but these little angels have brought so much joy into my life. They remind me to stay positive, even when things are tough. More importantly, they can telepathically communicate with ANYONE - no matter if they’re awake or sleeping!” MC: “Wow, that’s incredible! It must be so special to have such a close connection with them.” Natsuki: “It really is. Sometimes, when I’m feeling down, they’ll send me comforting thoughts or even funny images to make me smile. It’s like having a team of cheerleaders with me at all times. Anyways, would you like to feel them kicking?” MC: “Oh, um, sure! If it’s okay with you.” Natsuki: “Of course, it’s no problem. Here, just place your hand gently on my belly.” (I hesitantly place my hand on Natsuki’s belly, feeling the gentle movements of her unborn triplets.) MC: (amazed) “Wow, Natsuki. This is incredible. I can actually feel them moving. They’re so active and full of energy.” Natsuki: (smiling warmly) “I’m glad you can experience it too, MC. It’s one of the greatest joys of being a mother, feeling their little kicks and knowing they’re growing healthy and strong.” MC: “I can only imagine the love and happiness they bring to you and how much they’ve changed your life for the better. It’s truly magical.” Natsuki: (emotional) “It really is, MC. Before, I never would have imagined myself in this position, but now I can’t imagine my life without them. They’ve given me a purpose, a reason to keep pushing forward even when things get tough.” (Just then, I could hear Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters telepathically communicate with me. They were calling me by a name I’ve never expected - “Uncle MC”.) Daughter 1: “Hey, Uncle MC!” (I was taken aback by the voice of one of Natsuki’s unborn triplet daughters.) MC: “Did…did I just hear one of your daughters call me Uncle MC?” Natsuki: (surprised) “Oh! You heard that too? Yeah, they’ve started calling you that recently. I guess they see you as a close friend and someone they can rely on, just like family.” MC: (overwhelmed with emotion) “That means so much to me, Natsuki. To think that your daughters already consider me a part of their family, it’s truly touching. I’ll always be there for them, just like a proud uncle.” Natsuki: (teary-eyed) “Thank you, MC. I know they’re lucky to have you in their lives. And I’m lucky to have you by my side as well. We’re all in this together, creating a loving and supportive family.” MC: (smiling) “Absolutely, Natsuki. We’re in this together, now and always. I can’t wait to meet your wonderful daughters when they come into this world and be there for every step of their journey.” Natsuki: (grateful) “And I can’t wait for you to be a part of their lives, to share in their joys and milestones. It’s going to be an amazing adventure, and I’m so glad you’re here with us.” (As Natsuki and I continued to feel the gentle movements of her unborn triplet daughters, we embraced the love and unity that surrounded us, knowing that our bond would only grow stronger with time. Even if Natsuki was an angel, I loved her the same.) (That night, we went to the clubroom to see what other sort of supernatural creatures the rest of the girls were.) (At the clubroom, we find Yuri, Sayori, Monika, and a mysterious figure sitting together.) MC: “Hey everyone, what’s going on here?” Monika: “Oh, MC! We were just discussing our own supernatural abilities. It seems we all come from a legacy of supernatural creatures - each one having some sort of founder, with their name permanently wedged into our minds ever since we were born.” Natsuki: “Yeah, even though I’m an angel, that doesn’t mean the rest of us are supernatural beings.” MC: “Really? That’s interesting. What sort of supernatural creatures are all of you?” Yuri: “Heh. You should see my abilities for yourself.” (Yuri suddenly ran around me at blinding speed. She then returned to her seat - sipping a glass of blood when she sat back down.) MC: (astonished) “Yuri, what was that? How did you move so fast?” Yuri: “I have inherited the traits of a vampire. My supernatural speed and enhanced senses allow me to maneuver quickly and efficiently. And as for the founder of my supernatural clan…” Sayori: “And I-” Yuri: “LET ME FINISH!” Sayori: (giggling) “Sorry, Yuri. Go ahead.” Yuri: (clears her throat) “The founder of my clan is none other than Vlad Dracula, famously known as Count Dracula.” MC: “Wait, seriously? You’re descended from Count Dracula himself?” Yuri: “Yes, it seems so. I’ve always been drawn to the dark, and I suppose it’s in my blood. Pun intended.” Natsuki: “That’s pretty cool, Yuri. I’ve always found vampires fascinating.” Monika: “Well, Yuri isn’t the only one with supernatural abilities. I come from a lineage of witches. The founder of my clan is none other than the infamous witch, Morgan Le Fay.” MC: “A witch? That’s incredible, Monika! What sort of powers do you have?” Monika: “I have the ability to manipulate and control various elements. Fire, water, earth, and even air. I can harness their power and use it to my advantage.” MC: “Wow, that’s amazing! You must be incredibly powerful.” Monika: “Thank you, MC. It’s definitely a unique gift.” Sayori: “And don’t forget about me, MC! I come from a lineage of fairies. The founder of my clan is Titania, Queen of the Fairies.” MC: “A fairy? That’s so adorable, Sayori!” Sayori: (giggling) “Thank you, MC! Fairies have the power to bring joy and happiness to the world. We have the ability to manipulate emotions and spread positivity wherever we go.” Natsuki: “Aw, Sayori, that suits you perfectly!” MC: “So, what about the mysterious figure sitting with you? Do they have supernatural abilities too?” Monika: “Oh, this is our newest member, Kotonhoa.” Kotonhoa: (smiling warmly) “Hello, MC. It’s nice to meet you. I come from a lineage of shape-shifters. Our founder, Anansi, was a trickster spider known for his ability to change forms.” MC: “That’s fascinating, Kotonhoa! So, you can transform into different things?” Kotonhoa: “Indeed! I can take on the appearance of any living creature, be it animals or even humans. It’s quite handy for blending into different situations or keeping a low profile.” Natsuki: “That’s really cool, Kotonhoa! Shape-shifting must give you so much flexibility and adaptability.” Kotonhoa: “Thank you, Natsuki. It does grant me a certain level of versatility. And being able to experience the world from various perspectives is truly enriching.” Sayori: “That sounds like so much fun, Kotonhoa! I bet you have many exciting stories to share.” Kotonhoa: “Oh, I definitely do. Perhaps one day, I can regale you all with my tales.” MC: “That would be fantastic, Kotonhoa. We would love to hear about your adventures and the different forms you’ve taken.” Yuri: “Indeed, variety is always intriguing.” Monika: “Absolutely. We all have such unique abilities that make our experiences in this literature club even more extraordinary.” Natsuki: “Yeah, it’s pretty amazing how we’ve all come together with our supernatural backgrounds. It’s like fate brought us here.” Sayori: “Wait, Natsuki. You’ve never told us about the founder of your supernatural clan.” Natsuki: “Oh, you mean one of the archangels?” Sayori: “Hang on…the founder of your clan was an ARCHANGEL?!” Natsuki: (blushing) “Um, yeah. My clan originates from one of the archangels, specifically Archangel Gabriel.” MC: “Wow, Natsuki. That’s incredible! Archangels are considered powerful and divine beings. What sort of abilities do you have?” Natsuki: “Well, as an angel, I possess the ability to heal wounds and spread positivity. I can also communicate with other celestial beings and have a strong connection with the spiritual realm.” Yuri: “That’s truly remarkable, Natsuki. A healing angel among us, it’s quite fitting.” Monika: “Absolutely, Natsuki. Your ability to bring comfort and uplift others is a gift in itself.” Kotonhoa: “Indeed, Natsuki. Your presence brings a sense of calmness and warmth to the club. It’s like a ray of sunshine.” Sayori: “Aw, Natsuki, that’s so sweet! You truly are an angel both inside and out.” Natsuki: (blushing) “Th-thank you, everyone. Your kind words mean a lot to me.” MC: “Well, it seems like our club is truly filled with extraordinary individuals. We each bring our own unique abilities and backgrounds to create something magical.” Monika: “Yes, MC. And together, we can create a literature club that transcends the ordinary. Our stories and experiences will be unlike anything else.” Yuri: “Exactly. We have the opportunity to explore different worlds, both real and supernatural, through the power of literature.” Sayori: “And no matter what our backgrounds are, we’re all here to support and uplift each other.” Kotonhoa: “Indeed, every member of this club brings something special to the table. It’s a privilege to be a part of such a diverse and talented group.” Natsuki: (smiling) “I couldn’t agree more. Our differences make us stronger, and our shared love for literature binds us together.” MC: “Well said, Natsuki. Our club is truly a place where we can embrace our supernatural abilities, explore different worlds through literature, and form unbreakable bonds.” (As we continue our discussion, the club is filled with excitement and anticipation for the countless adventures and stories that await us. Together, we embark on a journey of literature, friendship, and the supernatural, creating a club like no other. Just then, I received an urgent message from my older sister Hydrazea - back on my home planet of Astaria. Judging from the pain in her voice, I could tell something was wrong.) Hydrazea: (via holographic message) “MC, I need your help! This pain in my belly…it just won’t stop!” MC: “Hydrazea, what’s happening? Are you in danger? I’ll do anything to help you!” Hydrazea: “It’s…it’s the baby!” MC: “The baby? What’s happening with the baby?” Hydrazea: “I think… I’m going into labor. But it’s too soon, MC. I’m only 7 months pregnant.”","completion":"MC: \\"Oh no, Hydrazea! That's not good. Is there anything I can do to help?\\" Hydrazea: \\"I don't know, MC. The pain is getting worse, and I can't contact the medical team. I need someone to be with me.\\" MC: \\"I'll be right there, Hydrazea. Just hold on a little longer. I'll find a way to get to Astaria as quickly as possible.\\" Natsuki: \\"MC, what's wrong? You look worried.\\" MC: \\"It's my sister, Hydrazea. She's going into labor, but it's too soon. I need to go to Astaria immediately.\\" Natsuki: (concerned) \\"Oh no, MC. Is there anything I can do to help?\\" MC: \\"I...I don't know. I need to figure out a way to travel to Astaria. It's in a different dimension, so it's not going to be easy.\\" Monika: \\"MC, why don't we use the power of literature to find a solution? We've encountered supernatural beings and different worlds before. Maybe there's a way we can utilize that to help you.\\" Yuri: \\"That's a great idea, Monika. With our combined knowledge and abilities, we might be able to find a way to travel to Astaria.\\" Sayori: \\"Yes, MC, we're here for you. We'll do everything we can to help you reach your sister.\\" MC: \\"Thank you, everyone. I really appreciate it. Let's gather our books and start researching. Maybe we'll come across something that can help us cross dimensions.\\" (Together, we start searching through various books in the clubroom. Pages turn, words blur together, until finally, we stumble upon a book titled \\"Interdimensional Travel and Energy Manipulation.\\") Monika: \\"This could be it, MC. This book seems to have information on interdimensional travel.\\" Yuri: \\"Let's read it carefully and see if there are any clues or methods we can utilize.\\" (As we dive into the book, we come across a chapter that details using a specific incantation and a combination of magical objects to create an interdimensional portal.) MC: \\"This might work! We just need to gather the required objects and perform the incantation.\\" Natsuki: \\"What are the objects, MC?\\" MC: \\"The book mentions a crystal infused with cosmic energy, a feather from a mythical creature, and a vial of moonlight essence.\\" Yuri: \\"Finding these objects might be a challenge, but with our abilities and connections, we might be able to do it.\\" Sayori: \\"Absolutely! Let's split up and each take a task. We have to work quickly, time is of the essence.\\" (Monika and Yuri go in search of the crystal, while Natsuki and Sayori look for the feather and moonlight essence respectively.) MC: (sending a telepathic message to Hydrazea) \\"Hang on, Hydrazea. We're coming for you. Stay strong.\\" (As I wait anxiously for the others to return, I can't help but feel grateful for the support of my friends. Together, we've faced incredible wonders and challenges, and I know that we'll find a way to help Hydrazea and her baby. With literature as our guide, nothing seems impossible.)"},{"prompt":"(In Natsuki’s room…) Natsuki: (cleaning her halo) “Come on…get clean already…” (Eventually, I [MC] enter the room.)

Lifting Ability: Immeasurable Striking Ability: Multi-Universal, likely Multiversal+ (Collapsed the entire mobtalker reality from simply getting fearful. As an NPC she sustains and governs over several stories and should be comparable to The Player who created every Story that can be possible) Durability: Multi-Universe Level, likely Multiverse Level+ (Chii was likely able to survive the destruction of all parallel worlds and dimensions in Mobtalker). Abstract Existence, Immortality and Regeneration make Andr harder to kill through conventional methods. Stamina: Very High (Can stand in the same area for 8 days and not even break a sweat, in fact, she had so much energy she literally got frustrated and continued to keep moving) Range: Multi-Universal to Multiversal+ (Chii can accidentally collapse the entire Mobtalker reality upon itself and even effect your computer by freezing it.Substains and governs over several worlds simultaneously) Intelligence: Genius (She has knowledge on how regeneration works, as well as knowing how to create potions and various other substances.

NPC's have the ability to basically utilize the game/universe itself as a means of either defense, as well as to maintain or oversee growth and stability across existence. Save/Load Mechanic: This allows Andr to save moments in Space-Time which she can then load to travel back to later. She can also use this as a means to load other universes/timelines and even creating entire Universes. Deletion: Andr can utilize the erasure ability to erase objects from existence whether it be beings or entire worlds/stories.

How’s everything going with the halo cleaning?” Natsuki: “Ugh, it’s such a pain. This thing gets dirty way too easily. I’ve been trying different methods, but it just doesn’t want to cooperate. It’s like it’s mocking me or something.” (feeling her unborn triplet daughters kicking) “Oh!” MC: “Whoa, Natsuki! Are you alright? Are you feeling okay?” Natsuki: (rubbing her belly) “Yeah, I’m fine. It’s just my unborn triplet daughters. They’re really active today. They always seem to respond whenever I’m feeling frustrated or stressed.” MC: “That’s amazing! It’s like they can sense your emotions even before they’re born. It must be quite an experience to have them with you all the time.” Natsuki: (smiling) “It definitely is. I never thought I’d be a mother at such a young age, but these little angels have brought so much joy into my life. They remind me to stay positive, even when things are tough. More importantly, they can telepathically communicate with ANYONE - no matter if they’re awake or sleeping!” MC: “Wow, that’s incredible! It must be so special to have such a close connection with them.” Natsuki: “It really is. Sometimes, when I’m feeling down, they’ll send me comforting thoughts or even funny images to make me smile.

We were just discussing our own supernatural abilities. It seems we all come from a legacy of supernatural creatures - each one having some sort of founder, with their name permanently wedged into our minds ever since we were born.” Natsuki: “Yeah, even though I’m an angel, that doesn’t mean the rest of us are supernatural beings.” MC: “Really?

I’ve always found vampires fascinating.” Monika: “Well, Yuri isn’t the only one with supernatural abilities. I come from a lineage of witches. The founder of my clan is none other than the infamous witch, Morgan Le Fay.” MC: “A witch? That’s incredible, Monika! What sort of powers do you have?” Monika: “I have the ability to manipulate and control various elements. Fire, water, earth, and even air. I can harness their power and use it to my advantage.” MC: “Wow, that’s amazing! You must be incredibly powerful.” Monika: “Thank you, MC. It’s definitely a unique gift.” Sayori: “And don’t forget about me, MC! I come from a lineage of fairies. The founder of my clan is Titania, Queen of the Fairies.” MC: “A fairy? That’s so adorable, Sayori!” Sayori: (giggling) “Thank you, MC! Fairies have the power to bring joy and happiness to the world. We have the ability to manipulate emotions and spread positivity wherever we go.” Natsuki: “Aw, Sayori, that suits you perfectly!” MC: “So, what about the mysterious figure sitting with you? Do they have supernatural abilities too?” Monika: “Oh, this is our newest member, Kotonhoa.” Kotonhoa: (smiling warmly) “Hello, MC. It’s nice to meet you. I come from a lineage of shape-shifters. Our founder, Anansi, was a trickster spider known for his ability to change forms.” MC: “That’s fascinating, Kotonhoa! So, you can transform into different things?” Kotonhoa: “Indeed! I can take on the appearance of any living creature, be it animals or even humans. It’s quite handy for blending into different situations or keeping a low profile.” Natsuki: “That’s really cool, Kotonhoa! Shape-shifting must give you so much flexibility and adaptability.” Kotonhoa: “Thank you, Natsuki. It does grant me a certain level of versatility. And being able to experience the world from various perspectives is truly enriching.” Sayori: “That sounds like so much fun, Kotonhoa! I bet you have many exciting stories to share.” Kotonhoa: “Oh, I definitely do. Perhaps one day, I can regale you all with my tales.” MC: “That would be fantastic, Kotonhoa. We would love to hear about your adventures and the different forms you’ve taken.” Yuri: “Indeed, variety is always intriguing.” Monika: “Absolutely. We all have such unique abilities that make our experiences in this literature club even more extraordinary.” Natsuki: “Yeah, it’s pretty amazing how we’ve all come together with our supernatural backgrounds. It’s like fate brought us here.” Sayori: “Wait, Natsuki. You’ve never told us about the founder of your supernatural clan.” Natsuki: “Oh, you mean one of the archangels?” Sayori: “Hang on…the founder of your clan was an ARCHANGEL?!” Natsuki: (blushing) “Um, yeah. My clan originates from one of the archangels, specifically Archangel Gabriel.” MC: “Wow, Natsuki. That’s incredible! Archangels are considered powerful and divine beings. What sort of abilities do you have?” Natsuki: “Well, as an angel, I possess the ability to heal wounds and spread positivity. I can also communicate with other celestial beings and have a strong connection with the spiritual realm.” Yuri: “That’s truly remarkable, Natsuki. A healing angel among us, it’s quite fitting.” Monika: “Absolutely, Natsuki. Your ability to bring comfort and uplift others is a gift in itself.” Kotonhoa: “Indeed, Natsuki. Your presence brings a sense of calmness and warmth to the club. It’s like a ray of sunshine.” Sayori: “Aw, Natsuki, that’s so sweet! You truly are an angel both inside and out.” Natsuki: (blushing) “Th-thank you, everyone. Your kind words mean a lot to me.” MC: “Well, it seems like our club is truly filled with extraordinary individuals. We each bring our own unique abilities and backgrounds to create something magical.” Monika: “Yes, MC. And together, we can create a literature club that transcends the ordinary. Our stories and experiences will be unlike anything else.” Yuri: “Exactly. We have the opportunity to explore different worlds, both real and supernatural, through the power of literature.” Sayori: “And no matter what our backgrounds are, we’re all here to support and uplift each other.” Kotonhoa: “Indeed, every member of this club brings something special to the table. It’s a privilege to be a part of such a diverse and talented group.” Natsuki: (smiling) “I couldn’t agree more. Our differences make us stronger, and our shared love for literature binds us together.” MC: “Well said, Natsuki. Our club is truly a place where we can embrace our supernatural abilities, explore different worlds through literature, and form unbreakable bonds.” (As we continue our discussion, the club is filled with excitement and anticipation for the countless adventures and stories that await us. Together, we embark on a journey of literature, friendship, and the supernatural, creating a club like no other.

I’ll do anything to help you!” Hydrazea: “It’s…it’s the baby!” MC: “The baby? What’s happening with the baby?” Hydrazea: “I think…I’m going into labor. But it’s too soon, MC. I’m only 7 months pregnant.” MC: “Oh no, Hydrazea! That’s much too early. I’ll immediately find a way back to Astaria. Just hold on, help is on the way.” Natsuki: “MC, what’s wrong? Is everything alright?” MC: “Natsuki, I just received a distressing message from my sister. She’s going into labor prematurely, and she needs my help. I have to go back to Astaria immediately.” Natsuki: “Oh no, MC. Is there anything I can do to help?” MC: “I appreciate the offer, Natsuki, but I need to handle this on my own. I promise I’ll be back as soon as I can. In the meantime, please take care of yourself and the rest of the club.” Natsuki: “Of course, MC. Don’t worry about us. Family comes first, and we’ll be here waiting for you when you return.” MC: “Thank you, Natsuki. Your understanding means the world to me. I’ll keep you updated on the situation as much as I can.” Monika: “MC, if there’s anything we can do to support you, please let us know. We’re here for you.” MC: “Thank you, Monika. I appreciate your support. I’ll be sure to reach out if I need anything.” (Yuri and Sayori exchange worried glances, their concern evident on their faces.) Yuri: “MC, we’ll be keeping you and your sister in our thoughts. We hope for a safe and healthy delivery.” Sayori: “Yes, MC. Don’t forget that we’re all here for you, even from a distance. Take care of yourself and your sister.” MC: “Thank you, Yuri and Sayori. Your well wishes mean a lot to me. I’ll do everything I can to ensure the safety of my sister and the baby.” (With a heavy heart, I leave the clubroom and entered my UFO to leave for Astaria. As I step through, I can’t help but feel a sense of anxiety and urgency, knowing that my sister and her unborn child are in danger.)","completion":"(On the journey back to Astaria…) MC: (thinking to himself) “Please, let Hydrazea and the baby be okay.

Images of his sister and their childhood together flash before his eyes. He remembers the joy they shared, the laughter, and the unbreakable bond they formed.)

Hydrazea: (gasping) “MC!” MC: (rushing to her side) “Hydrazea, I’m here. You’re doing great. Just hold on.” Hydrazea: (teary-eyed) “It’s too early, MC. I’m so scared.” MC: (holding her hand) “I know, Hydrazea. But you’re strong, and so is the baby. We’ll get through this together.” (As the medical team works tirelessly, MC remains by Hydrazea’s side, providing comfort and support.) Hydrazea: (gritting her teeth) “I can’t do this, MC. It hurts so much.” MC: (stroking her hair) “I know it’s difficult, Hydrazea. But you’re a fighter. You’ve always been strong. Just keep pushing, and soon we’ll hold your precious baby in our arms.” (The sound of a baby’s cry fills the room, and MC and Hydrazea look at each other, tears streaming down their faces.) Doctor: (smiling) “Congratulations, it’s a healthy baby girl.” (Hydrazea and MC exhale in relief, overwhelmed with joy and gratitude.) Hydrazea: (whispering) “We did it, MC. We brought her into the world.” MC: (whispering back) “Yes, we did, Hydrazea. And she’s perfect.” (As Hydrazea holds her daughter for the first time, a newfound sense of love and protectiveness floods through her.) Hydrazea: (whispering to the baby) “Welcome to the world, my little angel. You’re loved more than words can express.” MC: (placing a hand on Hydrazea’s shoulder) “She truly is a miracle, Hydrazea. And you, you are an incredible mother. I’m so proud of you.” (With tears of joy streaming down their faces, the siblings embrace, basking in the miracle of new life.) (Meanwhile, back in the literature club…) Natsuki: (sighing) “I hope MC and his sister are doing okay. It must be a really tough time for them.” Monika: (nodding) “Yes, it’s definitely a challenging situation. But I believe in MC’s strength and resilience. He’ll do whatever it takes to support his sister and the baby.” Yuri: “Indeed. MC’s love for his family is evident, and I have no doubt he’ll be a wonderful support system for them.” Sayori: “I just hope everything works out for them. We’ll be here, ready to welcome MC back when he returns.” (The club members continue to share their concerns and hopes for MC and his family, offering support and encouragement.) (Back on Astaria…) MC: (holding his niece) “She’s beautiful, Hydrazea. What are you going to name her?” Hydrazea: (smiling) “I want to name her Aurora. It means ‘dawn’ - a symbol of new beginnings and hope.” MC: (teary-eyed) “Aurora…it’s a perfect name for her. Welcome to our family, little Aurora.” (As MC and Hydrazea bond with Aurora, they feel a sense of completeness and overwhelming love.

Sie kommt im Süden Nordamerikas und vorwiegend in Mittelamerika vor und ist eine der bekanntesten Arten der Familie. Die Große Wanderspinne erhält eine gewisse Bedeutung dadurch, dass sie nicht selten als Forschungsobjekt wissenschaftlicher Untersuchungen Verwendung findet und gelegentlich als Heimtier in der Terraristik gehalten wird. Die Bezeichnung „Tigerspinne“ rührt von den Ringeln der Beine beim Weibchen her.', 'Die nachtaktive Große Wanderspinne legt entsprechend ihrer Trivialbezeichnung in der Nacht weite Wanderungen zurück und legt kein Spinnennetz an, sondern erlegt Beutetiere freilaufend als Lauerjäger. In das Beuteschema der vergleichsweise großen Spinne fallen dabei neben anderen Gliederfüßern auch kleinere Wirbeltiere. Die Große Wanderspinne verbringt den Großteil des Tages in selbst geschaffenen Zufluchtsorten an von der Art bevorzugten Pflanzen, etwa einigen Bromeliengewächsen oder in Plantagen angebauten Pflanzen der Dessertbanane (\\"Musa × paradisiaca\\"). Das Paarungsverhalten verläuft wie bei anderen Mitgliedern der Überfamilie der Lycosoidea und schließt somit ein Balzverhalten, jedoch wie bei der Gattung üblich auch eine Kommunikation über Vibrationen und Pheromone (Botenstoffe) mit ein. Das begattete Weibchen fertigt nacheinander mehrere Eikokons und bewacht diese zumeist bis zum Schlupf der Nachkommen in seinem Wohngespinst. Sollte die Möglichkeit gegeben sein, taucht die Spinne in den dann mit Wasser gefüllten Zufluchtsorten (dabei insbesondere in den Blatttrichtern von Bromeliengewächsen) unter und verbleibt dort für einige Zeit. Die geschlüpften Jungtiere wachsen selbstständig heran.', 'Die Große Wanderspinne wird wie einige andere Arten der Gattung \\"Cupiennius\\" gelegentlich als Bananenspinne bezeichnet, was daher rührt, dass einzelne Exemplare der Art gelegentlich an Bananenstauden befindlich von Mittelamerika aus in andere Kontinente exportiert werden. Aus dem gleichen Grund erhalten auch die optisch ähnlichen, teilweise deutlich gefährlicheren Vertreter der Gattung \\"Phoneutria\\" aus der Familie der Kammspinnen (Ctenidae) diese Bezeichnung. Der englische Trivialname der Großen Wanderspinne lautet \\"Tiger wandering spider\\", was in etwa mit der deutschen Trivialbezeichnung „Wandernde Tigerspinne“ identisch ist. Die englische Trivialbezeichnung \\"Banana spider\\" wird genau wie das deutschsprachige Pendant auch für die Arten der Gattung \\"Phoneutria\\" und hier zusätzlich für die Warmhaus-Riesenkrabbenspinne (\\"Heteropoda venatoria\\") innerhalb der Familie der Riesenkrabbenspinnen (Sparassidae) verwendet. Wie diese ist die Große Wanderspinne, anders als einige Vertreter der Gattung \\"Phoneutria\\", etwa der Brasilianischen Wanderspinne (\\"P. nigriventer\\"), für den Menschen weitestgehend harmlos.', 'Merkmale.', 'Mit einer Körperlänge von 27 bis 45 Millimetern als Weibchen und 22 bis 30 Millimetern als Männchen ist die Große Wanderspinne die größte Art der Gattung \\"Cupiennius\\". Der grundsätzliche Körperbau entspricht dem anderer Arten der Gattung, womit auch die Große Wanderspinne ein langbeiniges Erscheinungsbild besitzt. Die Beinspannweite beider Geschlechter kann über 100 Millimeter betragen. Die Beine ermöglichen der Spinne eine agile und schnelle Fortbewegung. Die dichte Scopula (Beinbehaarung), die die Extremitäten einschließlich der Tarsen (Fußglieder) der Großen Wanderspinne bedeckt, ermöglicht ihr zudem die problemlose Fortbewegung auf glatten Oberflächen, etwa Glasscheiben.', 'Zumindest das Weibchen der Großen Wanderspinne kann überdies erfolgreich untertauchen und sich unter Wasser fortbewegen. Der Sauerstoffvorrat wird dabei mithilfe der Setae (Behaarung) gespeichert, was der Spinne ein maximal 90-minütiges Aufhalten unter Wasser ermöglicht. Dies wird aber nur von Weibchen angewandt, die einen Eikokon bewachen. Ob das Männchen der Art schwimmen kann, ist unbekannt.', 'Wahrnehmungsvermögen.', 'Die Große Wanderspinne verfügt über ein gutes Wahrnehmungsvermögen durch ihren guten Seh- und Vibrationssinn. Diese Eigenschaften haben die Art zu einem begehrten Forschungsobjekt der Arachnologie (Spinnenkunde) gemacht.', 'Sehsinn.', 'Der gute Sehsinn der Großen Wanderspinne wird ihr durch die wie bei vielen der Überfamilie \\"Lycosoidea\\" angehörigen Spinnenarten leistungsfähigen Augen verliehen. Die acht Augen sind in die zwei geringfügig größeren und nach vorne gerichteten Haupt- und die sechs kleineren, entweder zur Seite oder nach hinten gerichteten Nebenaugen aufgeteilt. Die Hauptaugen dienen zur Wahrnehmung von Formen, die seitlichen Nebenaugen zur Wahrnehmung von Bewegungen. Ebenso ermöglicht der Sehsinn der Spinne das Abschätzen von Entfernungen und Formen und hilft bevorzugt dabei, Unterschlüpfe zu finden. Der Aufbau der Augen der Großen Wanderspinne und deren Stellung ist mit der anderer Vertreter der Gattung \\"Cupiennius\\" identisch und gliedert sich, wie für Spinnen der Überfamilie Lycosoidea üblich, in zwei übereinander gegliederte Augenreihen, die je vier Augen enthalten. Die zwei Hauptaugen, denen ein Tapetum lucidum (reflektierende Netzhaut) fehlt, sind im Zentrum der oberen Reihe angelegt. Im Gegensatz dazu weisen die Nebenaugen ein rostfarbenes Tapetum lucidum mit in Reihen angeordneten Rezeptoren auf. Die Winkelabstände dieser Rezeptoren entlang und zwischen den Reihen betragen 3,6° und 9,3°, 0,9° und 2,3° sowie 1,0° und 3,0°.', 'Früher wurde aufgrund der Nachtaktivität der Art vermutet, dass ihr Sehsinn eine untergeordnete Rolle spielt. Diese Annahme wurde bei 2015 stattgefundenen Versuchen, die dazu dienten, den Sehsinn der Großen Wanderspinne zu erforschen, widerlegt. Dabei wurde auch herausgefunden, dass die Augen aufgrund der nachtaktiven Lebensweise äußerst lichtempfindlich sind und die Spinne insbesondere größere und dunklere Objekte (bei den Versuchen in Form von Projektionen) aufsucht, was vermutlich daran liegt, dass die Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass diese sich als geeigneter Unterschlupf erweisen können, größer ausfällt. Auch werden näher gelegene Objekte dieser Art bevorzugt aufgesucht, was die Fähigkeit zur Abschätzung von Entfernung seitens der Großen Wanderspinne bestätigt. Diese Fähigkeit ist für Wirbellose und für Tiere, die kein stereoskopisches Sichtfeld besitzen, ungewöhnlich. Da die Versuchstiere der Großen Wanderspinne sich nicht in einer geraden Linie, sondern im Zickzack auf die dunklen Projektionen zubewegten, wird angenommen, dass die Art Bewegungsparallaxen nutzt, sich also im Sichtfeld nähergelegene Objekte schneller verrücken als solche, die weiter entfernt liegen.', 'Vibrationssinn.', 'Der wie der Sehsinn gut entwickelte Vibrationssinn der Großen Wanderspinne ermöglicht ihr das Wahrnehmen von sehr leichten Vibrationen und anderen Luftbewegungen. Dieser Sinn spielt besonders beim Jagen eine wichtige Rolle und ermöglicht es der Spinne unter anderem, fliegende Insekten in der Luft zu lokalisieren.', 'Der feine Vibrationssinn wird durch über 3.000 über das gesamte Exoskelett (Chitinpanzer) der Spinne verteilte Sensillen (Spaltsinnesorgane, bzw. Sensormembranen) ermöglicht. Davon sind bis zu 30 nah an den Gelenken gelegene und dort fast parallel angeordnete Sensillen zu sog. Lyraförmigen Organen ausgebildet. Sie sind die Sensillen mit dem höchsten Wahrnehmungsvermögen und ermöglichen es der Spinne auch, Vibrationen, die nur noch im Nanometer-Bereich messbar sind, zu registrieren. Die Formation der Lyraförmigen Organe ist ebenfalls mit der anderer Arten der Gattung identisch. Bedingt durch die Lage registriert die Spinne Auslenkungen benachbarter Beinglieder, die auf bewegungsbedingte Kräfte im Exoskelett reagieren. Die Strukturen der einzelnen Lyraförmigen Organe, die der Registrierung von Erschütterungen dienen, sind ungefähr zwei Mikrometer breit und bis zu 200 Mikrometer lang. Bedeckt werden sie von einer Hautmembran des Exoskeletts, die wiederum einen sog. Kopplungszylinder beinhaltet, in dem der Dendrit einer Nervenzelle endet.', 'Mithilfe der Weißlichtinterferometrie und Mikrokraftmessungen ließen sich die Reiztransformation in Dehnungssensoren analysieren. Erforscht wurde u. a. das propriorezeptive Lyraförmige Organ HS-8 nahe der Distalseite der Gelenke der Tibien, das eine Länge von 1,4 und, abhängig von der Anordnung des Schlitzes, eine Breite von geringfügig mehr als 30 Nanometern aufweist. Die mechanische Empfindlichkeit dieser Organe gegenüber äußeren Krafteinwirkungen lag bei im Rahmen von Versuchen erfolgten Messungen, bei denen Kräfte im Bereich von 0,01 Millinewton angewandt wurden, im Bereich von 106 bis 13 Nanometern pro Mikronewton und nahm mit abnehmender Schlitzlänge im minimalen Ausmaß ab. Dieses Lyraförmige Organ ist an der kinästhetischen (bewegungsempfindlichen) Orientierung beteiligt und löst bei Stimulation Muskelreflexe aus. Direkte Messungen von Dehnungen in der Nagelhaut ungehindert freilaufender Individuen der Großen Wanderspinne unter Verwendung miniaturisierter technischer Dehnungsmessstreifen zeigten, dass das Organ während der Standphase eines Schritts komprimiert und stimuliert wird und somit als Belastungssensor des Exoskeletts fungiert.', 'Anders verhält es sich bei der zweiten untersuchten Gruppe dieser Organe, dem Lyraförmigen Organ HS-10, das am Metatarsus befindlich ist. Die Lage dieses Organs verrät, dass es an die Erfassung von Schwingungsamplituden angepasst ist, wie sie unter natürlichen Bedingungen in größerer Varietät vorkommen können. Mit einer Empfindlichkeit von 522 und 195 Nanometern je Mikronewton bei den untersuchten Schlitzstrukturen dieses Lyraförmigen Organs konnte ein fast dreifacher Unterschied vermerkt werden, was die Fraktionierung des Reizbereichs zwischen diesen Schlitzen hinsichtlich ihrer Anordnung widerspiegelt. Diese Sensoren werden simuliert, wenn sich der Tarsus der Spinne nach oben bewegt und gegen den Metatarsus mitsamt dem dort befindlichen Organ drückt. Das Lyraförmige Organ HS-10 ist ein hochempfindlicher Vibrationssensor, mit dem die Spinne Vibrationen wahrnehmen und unterscheiden kann, die von Beutetieren, Geschlechtspartnern oder Prädatoren (Fressfeinden) stammen.

Jahrhundert)', 'Kaiser der Qing-Dynastie', 'Mandschu', 'Mann'], 'Qianlong (, * 25. September 1711 in Peking; † 7. Februar 1799 ebenda, Verbotene Stadt) war der vierte chinesische Kaiser der Qing-Dynastie und regierte offiziell vom 18. Oktober 1735 bis zum 9. Februar 1796, inoffiziell bis zu seinem Tod im Jahre 1799. Sein Geburtsname war \\"Àixīnjuéluó Hónglì\\" (), genannt „Prinz Bǎo“ (); sein Tempelname lautet \\"Gāozōng\\" (, „Hoher Ahne“) und sein Ehrenname \\"Chúndì\\" (, „Reiner Kaiser“). Qianlong war Sohn des Yongzheng-Kaisers () und der kaiserlichen Gemahlin Xiao Sheng Xian ().', 'Die Herrschaft des Qianlong-Kaisers gilt als Höhepunkt der Qing-Dynastie und ist im Rückblick als eines der „Goldenen Zeitalter“ der chinesischen Zivilisation verklärt worden. Der Kaiser zeigte sich als ambitionierter und pflichtbewusster Staatsmann, der die Grenzen Chinas weit nach Zentralasien ausdehnte und die eigene Kultur nachhaltig förderte. Qianlong betätigte sich selbst als Dichter, Maler und Meister der Kalligrafie, darüber hinaus trug er eine der größten bekannten Kunstkollektionen der Welt zusammen. Resultat dieser Sammelleidenschaft war ebenfalls die sogenannte \\"Vollständige Bibliothek der Vier Schatzkammern\\", die umfangreichste Zusammenstellung der chinesischen Literaturgeschichte. Qianlongs ungewöhnlich lange Regierungszeit war maßgeblich von politischer Stabilität, wirtschaftlichem Wohlstand sowie dem allgemeinen Hang zur Prachtentfaltung geprägt. Am Ende seiner Amtszeit wurden jedoch auch die ersten Anzeichen für die Probleme des darauf folgenden Jahrhunderts deutlich.', 'Jugend.', 'Der spätere Qianlong-Kaiser wurde als vierter Sohn des Prinzen Yinzhen und Enkel des Kangxi-Kaisers im Jahr 1711 geboren. Man gab ihm den Namen Hongli und verlieh ihm 1733 den Titel eines Prinzen Bao. Zunächst wuchs er in der Residenz seines Vaters auf, doch als er etwa zehn Jahre alt war, befahl sein Großvater ihn in der Palastschule zu unterrichten, somit lebte sein Enkel fortan bei ihm am Kaiserhof und Kangxi konnte Hongli besser kennenlernen. Der alte Kaiser hatte zu diesem Zeitpunkt über einhundert Enkelkinder und kannte die meisten davon so gut wie gar nicht. Doch Hongli erweckte seine Aufmerksamkeit bereits während einer kaiserlichen Hetzjagd, als ein Bär den jungen Prinzen angriff und Hongli nicht vor ihm zurückwich, sondern einen Pfeil auf das Tier abschoss. Schnell empfand Kangxi tiefe Zuneigung zu seinem Enkel und bemerkte dessen schnelle Auffassungsgabe und Sportlichkeit. Der alte Kaiser befahl, dass der Prinz einer besonders ausführlichen Ausbildung unterworfen werden sollte, und nahm sich seiner persönlich an.', 'Hongli war kaum elf Jahre alt, als sein Großvater 1722 starb und sein Vater als Kaiser Yongzheng den Thron bestieg. Der neue Kaiser schätzte seinen vierten Sohn ebenso sehr und ernannte ihn unverzüglich nach seiner Thronerhebung testamentarisch zum Kronprinzen. Keiner der kaiserlichen Prinzen wusste, wer Yongzheng nachfolgen würde, was Cliquenbildung verhindern sollte. Prinz Bao wurde weiter einem harten Studium unterworfen. Von sechs Uhr früh bis fünf Uhr abends musste er sich den Lektionen der Gelehrten widmen. Sein Vater selbst unterwies ihn in der Politik und überwachte seine Ausbildung streng. Der junge Qianlong wurde zu einem der am besten ausgebildeten Kaiser in der chinesischen Geschichte. Sein Studium umfasste humanistische Bildung, Poesie, Kalligrafie und Malerei, wobei er sich auf allen Gebieten als talentiert zeigte. Auch gelang es ihm außer Chinesisch und Mandschurisch auch noch Mongolisch, Uigurisch und Tibetisch zu beherrschen. Mit zweiundzwanzig Jahren legte er das kaiserliche Examen ab, indem er eine umfassende Analyse der konfuzianischen Klassiker erarbeitete.', 'Thronbesteigung.', 'Als 1735 Honglis Vater starb, war seine Nachfolge keine Überraschung mehr. Der Yongzheng-Kaiser hatte bereits offen seine Sympathie für den Prinzen Bao gezeigt. Der Prinz hatte des Öfteren als Regent in Abwesenheit des Vaters fungiert und war von diesem bei politischen Entscheidungen eingebunden worden. So war die Thronfolge am wenigsten für den neuen vierundzwanzigjährigen Kaiser eine Neuigkeit. Hongli legte, wie es die Tradition verlangte, seinen Geburtsnamen für immer ab und wählte für sich den Äranamen \\"qián lóng\\" (Aussprache: tchiän'lung), was sich mit \\"Himmlischer Überfluss\\" übersetzen lässt. \\"Qiánlóng\\" ist kein Eigenname, sondern die Regierungsdevise seiner Herrschaftsperiode, weshalb man korrekt vom \\"Qiánlóng-Kaiser\\" (乾隆帝) sprechen sollte.', 'Als erste Maßnahme entschied der neue Kaiser, alle Mitglieder des kaiserlichen Clans aus wichtigen Ämtern zu entlassen. Qianlong misstraute seiner weitläufigen Verwandtschaft zutiefst und fürchtete Fraktionskämpfe innerhalb des Hofes, wie sie in den letzten Regierungsjahren seines Großvaters vorgekommen waren. Selbst seinen Brüdern und Cousins, welche mit ihm an der Palastschule erzogen worden waren, schenkte er keinerlei Vertrauen. Die Prinzen wurden konsequent von der Regierung ausgeschlossen. Dies führte zwangsläufig zu einer Distanzierung des Kaisers zu seinen Verwandten, welche durchaus von ihm gewollt war. Der Kaiser war in seinen Augen eine übergeordnete Macht, die frei entscheiden können müsse und nicht von persönlichen Bindungen befangen sein dürfe.', 'Qianlongs Alltag war durch Traditionen reguliert und er führte ein sehr diszipliniertes Leben. Am liebsten beschäftigte er sich mit der Poesie, dem Sammeln von Kunstwerken und dem Bau von Gärten und Palästen. Als Herrscher war Qianlong ungemein arbeitsam. Er bewältigte täglich große Mengen Papier und ließ kein Detail unberücksichtigt. Er traf gern schnelle Entscheidungen, wobei er für Ratschläge stets offen blieb. Bei der Wahl seiner Ratgeber zeigte er eine gute Hand für Talente. Erst im hohen Alter von über achtzig Jahren sollte Qianlongs Urteilskraft und Arbeitseifer nachlassen, während sein Machtwille bis zu seinem Tod stark blieb.', 'Innenpolitik.', 'Stärkung der Lokalbehörden.', 'Neben den vielen kleinen Änderungen, die Qianlong in den Institutionen des Reiches vornahm, ist die Ausdehnung des sogenannten \\"baojia\\"-Systems besonders zu erwähnen. Es bildete die unterste Ebene im sozialen Kontrollmechanismus und diente dazu, die Gesetze auf lokalem Gebiet durchzusetzen und ihre Anwendung zu überwachen. Der Name \\"baojia\\" steht für ein System der örtlichen Sicherheit und geht auf die Reformen Wang Anshis während der Song-Dynastie zurück. Als die Mandschu 1644 Beijing einnahmen und ihre Dynastie etablierten, führten sie das \\"baojia\\" in ganz China ein, um die Autorität der Regierung zu stärken. Das \\"baojia\\"-Polizeisystem beruhte auf gegenseitiger Verantwortung für die örtlichen Gesetze und Aufrechterhaltung von Ruhe und Ordnung durch die Einwohner selbst. Es basierte auf Gruppen zu zehn Haushalten, welche wiederum von Lokalbeamten überwacht wurden. Ergänzt wurde das \\"baojia\\" durch das \\"lijia\\" genannte Steuererhebungssystem, welches ganz ähnlich organisiert wurde.', 'Beide Systeme waren nur bedingt wirkungsvoll, was soziale Kontrolle, Steuerabgaben und Volkszählung betraf. Kaiser Qianlong suchte diese Systeme zu reformieren und entschied sich 1740, eine Änderung einzuführen. Die Lokalbeamten sollten ab sofort nicht nur die erwachsenen Männer zählen, die zum Arbeitsdienst verpflichtet wurden, sondern die Arbeitsregistrierung mit dem Steuersystem verknüpfen und so alle Individuen eines Haushalts erfassen. Qianlongs Ratgeber erklärten, dass dieses Vorhaben der nahezu perfekten Volkszählung bei so vielen Millionen Einwohnern unmöglich sei. Der Kaiser war anderer Meinung und befahl, das \\"baojia\\" entsprechend seinen Vorgaben zu ändern. Fortan musste der Vorsteher einer zu je zehn Haushalten zusammengefassten Einheit den Namen, das Geschlecht und das Alter der Mitglieder eines Haushalts auf einer Plakette am Eingang notieren. Einmal im Jahr wurden die Änderungen dem zuständigen Lokalbeamten mitgeteilt. Auf diese einfache Art war es nun möglich, ein ziemlich genaues Bild über die Einwohnerzahl und deren Steueraufkommen zu gewinnen, was mögliche Unterschlagung eindämmen konnte. Auch wurde die lokale Ordnung gestärkt, denn die zehn Familien innerhalb des \\"baojia\\" mussten sich gegenseitig überwachen und Verstöße jedweder Art melden. Dadurch war die Kontrolle durch die örtlichen Behörden stark erweitert, und dieses System sollte auch eine lange Zeit sehr effektiv funktionieren.', 'Inspektionsreisen.', 'Wie sein Großvater Kangxi unternahm auch Qianlong ausgedehnte Inspektionstouren durch das Reich der Mitte. Diese Reisen dienten dem Kaiser dazu, sich persönlich ein Bild von den dringendsten Problemen im Land und den Fortschritten einzelner Projekte zu machen. Darüber hinaus waren sie große Ereignisse, durch die man Macht und Reichtum des Kaisers demonstrieren konnte. Die längsten Inspektionsreisen dauerten einige Monate und führten Qianlong in die reiche Region des Jangtsedeltas: 1751, 1757, 1762, 1765, 1780 und 1784. Daneben führten ihn noch über einhundert kleinere Touren in den Norden oder andere Gebiete unweit von Beijing. Bei seinen Reisen begleiteten ihn seine Ratgeber und eine kleine Zahl von Großsekretären und Mitgliedern des Staatsrats, um sich auch auf Reisen der Regierung widmen zu können. Darüber hinaus noch Künstler, Leibwachen, Palasteunuchen, Beamte, Hofdamen, Dienerinnen, Prinzen, Köche, Knechte und Soldaten. Im Schnitt nahm er bei seinen Inspektionen etwa 3000 Personen mit sich.', 'Solche Touren waren aufwendig und teuer. Ihre Organisation war daher eine Herausforderung. Qianlong hatte Reisepaläste bauen lassen, um unterwegs eine behagliche Unterkunft zu haben. Die südlichen Touren führten in die großen Zentren der Region: Yangzhou, Nanjing, Suzhou und Hangzhou. Die meiste Zeit verbrachte der Kaiser damit, Kanäle und Deiche zu begutachten oder andere öffentliche Bauten zu besuchen, mit Beamten und Gelehrten zu sprechen, Kriminelle zu begnadigen und Truppen zu inspizieren. Es kam aber auch oft vor, dass man Feste zu Ehren des Kaisers gab, organisiert durch wohlhabende Provinzbeamte und Kaufleute.

Sie kam hauptsächlich in Nordamerika vor, wo sie vom Oberen Miozän vor etwa neun Millionen Jahren bis in das ausgehende Pleistozän vor rund 11.000 Jahren nachweisbar ist. Ihr bekanntester Vertreter ist das Amerikanische Mastodon. Einzelne Arten wurden auch für Eurasien berichtet, doch ist ihre eindeutige Zuordnung zu \\"Mammut\\" nicht ganz zweifelsfrei. Sofern dies zutrifft, starben diese Vertreter der Gattung bereits im Übergang vom Pliozän zum Pleistozän aus.', 'Es handelt sich bei den Vertretern der Gattung \\"Mammut\\" um große Angehörige der Rüsseltiere, denen ein langgestreckter Körper und langer Schädel zu eigen war. Stoßzähne kamen weitgehend nur im oberen Gebiss vor und verliefen entweder gerade oder nach oben gekrümmt. Die unteren Stoßzähne hatten sich zurückentwickelt, kamen manchmal aber noch als rudimentäre Bildungen vor. Die hinteren Zähne zeichneten sich durch scharfkantige, querstehende Leisten aus. Alle Angehörigen der Gattung \\"Mammut\\" lebten weitgehend in Wäldern und ernährten sich überwiegend von weicher Pflanzenkost wie Blättern, Nadeln und Zweigen. Möglicherweise bildeten sie bereits, ähnlich den heutigen Elefanten, kleinere Familiengruppen.', 'Als Gattungsname wurde \\"Mammut\\" bereits im Jahr 1799 wissenschaftlich eingeführt, er setzte sich aber erst etwa Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts durch. Zuvor führten die meisten Wissenschaftler die Vertreter der Gattung unter der Bezeichnung „\\"Mastodon\\"“, die jedoch ungültig ist. Häufig wird der wissenschaftliche Name \\"Mammut\\" als Angehöriger der Mammutiden mit dem umgangssprachlichen Ausdruck Mammut verwechselt. Dieser bezieht sich allerdings auf die Gattung \\"Mammuthus\\", die wiederum mit den Elefanten näher verwandt ist und damit zu einer anderen Entwicklungslinie innerhalb der Rüsseltiere gehört.', 'Merkmale.', '\\"Mammut\\" war ein großer Vertreter der Rüsseltiere. Äußerlich ähnelte er den heutigen Elefanten. Allerdings war er im Gesamthabitus niedriger, der Rücken zeigte sich langgestreckter und die Gliedmaßen waren kräftiger gebaut. Für das weitgehend vollständige Skelett des sogenannten „Warren-Mastodons“ vom Hudson River im US-Bundesstaat New York, einem Angehörigen des Amerikanischen Mastodons (\\"Mammut americanum\\"), wird eine Gesamtlänge von 455 cm und eine Schulterhöhe von 278 cm angegeben. Das vermutete Körpergewicht lag bei 7,8 t, was auf vergleichenden Körpergrößenberechnungen anhand des rund 106 cm langen Oberschenkelknochens basiert. Weitere Femora anderer Individuen mit Längen zwischen 98 und 122 cm ergaben Gewichtswerte von 3,6 bis 11 t und eine maximale Körperhöhe von 325 cm. Deutlich größer wurde die Art \\"Mammut borsoni\\", deren Oberschenkelknochen bis zu 150 cm erreichte, was wiederum zu einer Schulterhöhe von 4,1 m und zu einem Körpergewicht von 16 t führt. Sie gehört damit zu den größten bekannten Vertretern der Rüsseltiere.', 'Der Schädel war langgestreckt, ähnlich wie bei \\"Zygolophodon\\", aber abweichend von diesem stärker aufgewölbt, so dass er als dom- oder kuppelartig angesehen werden kann. Er wies aber nicht die enorme Höhe auf, wie es bei den heutigen Elefanten der Fall ist. Abweichend von anderen Mammutiden besaß \\"Mammut\\" nur obere Stoßzähne, die deutlich auseinanderstanden und entweder weitgehend gerade verliefen oder nach oben gebogen waren. Beim „Warren-Mastodon“ erreichten die oberen Stoßzähne über die Krümmung gemessen eine Länge von 262 cm, davon steckten rund 60 cm, also knapp ein Viertel, in den kräftigen Alveolen. Bedingt durch die Konfiguration des Schädels verließen die Stoßzähne die Alveolen in einer nahezu horizontalen Lage, während sie bei den Elefanten mit ihren wesentlich gestauchteren Schädeln fast senkrecht nach unten austreten. Die horizontale Lage der oberen Stoßzähne trifft auch auf \\"Zygolophodon\\" zu, jedoch nahmen sie folgend einen abwärts gebogenen Verlauf. Zusätzlich kam hier ein schmales Zahnschmelzband an der Außenseite vor, welches wiederum bei \\"Mammut\\" fehlte. Im Unterkiefer von \\"Mammut\\" kamen nur selten Stoßzähne vor, die – sofern sie auftraten – klein beziehungsweise nur rudimentär waren. Durch das weitgehende Fehlen der unteren Stoßzähne hatten sich auch deren Alveolen zurückgebildet, die ursprünglich seitlich an der Symphyse des Unterkiefers lagen. Dies führte wiederum zu einer Kürzung der Symphyse selbst, wodurch \\"Mammut\\" einen kurzschnauzigen (\\"brevirostrinen\\") Charakter erhielt. Abweichend dazu verfügte \\"Zygolophodon\\" noch über kräftige untere Stoßzähne. Die dadurch lange Unterkiefersymphyse gab ihm eine langschnauzige (\\"longirostrine\\") Erscheinung.', 'Im weiteren Gebissaufbau zeigt \\"Mammut\\" einzelne Merkmale, die die Gattung mit stammesgeschichtlich moderneren Rüsseltieren wie den Gomphotherien und Elefanten verbindet. Hierzu gehört der horizontale Zahnwechsel, bei dem sich im hinteren Abschnitt des Kiefers beständig neues Zahnmaterial bildet, während die voranliegenden Zähne durch die Nahrungsaufnahme abgekaut werden. Dadurch befinden sich jeweils nur wenige Zähne zur gleichen Zeit in Funktion, abweichend vom vertikalen Zahnwechsel der meisten anderen Säugetiere, bei dem alle Zähne gleichzeitig in Kauposition gebracht werden. Ähnlich den heutigen Elefanten konnte \\"Mammut\\" dadurch sechs Zahngenerationen ausbilden. Das Gebiss setzte sich somit aus je drei (Milch)-Prämolaren und drei Molaren je Kieferbogen zusammen. Die Zahnformel wird häufig mit formula_1 angegeben. Im Zahnbau lassen sich jedoch deutliche Unterschiede zu den anderen Rüsseltiergruppen aufzeigen. \\"Mammut\\" besaß – wie andere Mammutiden – deutlich \\"zygodonte\\" bis \\"zygolophodonte\\" Zähne. Hierbei waren auf der Kauoberfläche quergestellte Leisten ausgebildet, die sich zwischen gegenständigen Höckerchen geformt hatten. In der Regel teilte eine Längsrille die Leisten in je zwei Halbleisten. Zwischen den einzelnen Leisten bestanden markante Eintiefungen, so dass die gesamte Zahnstruktur dachartig wirkte. Bei den Gomphotherien mit ihrem \\"bunodonten\\" Zahnaufbau verstellten zusätzliche Höckerchen die Längsrille und vor allem die Quertäler, wodurch ein unregelmäßigeres Oberflächenmuster entstand. Die Elefanten hingegen haben einen lamellenartigen Zahnaufbau. Bei \\"Mammut\\" waren die Leisten auf den oberen Zähnen senkrecht zur Zahnlängsachse orientiert, auf den unteren standen sie in einem leichten Winkel schräg dazu. Die Prämolaren und Molaren unterschieden sich durch die Anzahl der quergestellten Leisten. In der Regel wiesen die beiden vorderen Prämolaren nur zwei Leisten auf, waren also \\"bilophodont\\". Der dritte Prämolar und die ersten beiden Molaren hatten jeweils drei Leisten, was als \\"trilophodont\\" bezeichnet wird. Der jeweils letzte Molar besaß wiederum vier, manchmal auch mehr Leisten, hinzu kam ein kräftiges Cingulum am Zahnende, also ein markanter Zahnschmelzwulst. Durch die Zunahme der Leistenanzahl nahm die Zahngröße vom vordersten Prämolar zum letzten Molar an Größe zu. Ersterer maß im Durchschnitt 3,3 cm in der Länge, letzterer konnte bis zu 19 cm lang werden. Gegenüber \\"Zygolophodon\\" kam es bei \\"Mammut\\" zu einer deutlichen Zunahme der Höhe der Zahnkrone und einer Verbreiterung der Zähne.', 'Im postcranialen Skelettbau glichen sich die meisten großen Rüsseltiere, so dass hier nur wenige Besonderheiten auftreten. Die Gliedmaßenknochen waren allgemein schwer und massiv gebaut mit den Oberarm- und Oberschenkelknochen als größten Elementen. Die Elle zeichnete sich vor allem an ihrem unteren Ende als überaus kräftig aus und trug so wohl den Großteil des Gewichtes des Vorderbeins. Schien- und Wadenbein waren vollständig voneinander getrennt, letzteres lief in einem flachen, aber seitlich ausladenden unteren Gelenkende aus. Hand und Fuß bestanden wie bei allen Rüsseltieren jeweils aus fünf Strahlen. Die einzelnen Knochen hatten einen kurzen und kompakten Bau, der Fuß war aber insgesamt schmaler als die Hand.', 'Verbreitung.', 'Die Gattung \\"Mammut\\" war sowohl in Nordamerika als auch in Eurasien verbreitet. Letzteres ist allerdings nicht ganz eindeutig, da einzelne Wissenschaftler die eurasischen Funde teilweise oder vollständig zu \\"Zygolophodon\\" stellen. In Nordamerika waren die Tiere vom hohen Norden, dem heutigen Alaska und dem Yukon-Territorium, bis nach Süden in das heutige Mexiko verbreitet. Ein Großteil der Funde konzentriert sich dort im nordöstlichen und zentralen Landesteil. Als südlichster Fundpunkt wurde ein Mahlzahn aus dem nördlichen Honduras angegeben, dessen stratigraphische Herkunft aber unklar bleibt. Abweichend zu einigen Vertretern der etwa zeitgleichen Gomphotherien erreichte \\"Mammut\\" nie Südamerika. Im zentralen Nordamerika war \\"Mammut\\" von der Ostküste bis zur Westküste verbreitet. Eine starke Fundkonzentration liegt im Bereich der Großen Seen und im heutigen Florida. Ungeachtet der weiten Verbreitung von \\"Mammut\\" bestehen starke zeitliche Unterschiede. Ein Großteil der Funde stammt aus der Zeit der letzten Kaltzeit und verteilt sich auf die beiden Arten \\"Mammut americanum\\" und \\"Mammut pacificus\\". Sie schließen auch einige sehr gut erhaltene Skelette ein. Dagegen sind ältere Nachweise und vor allem solche aus der stammesgeschichtlichen Frühzeit eher locker gestreut und stärker fragmentarisch überliefert.', 'Ein Schwerpunkt der Verteilung in Eurasien bildet der östliche und südöstliche Teil von Europa, hauptsächlich vom heutigen Griechenland nordwärts bis in die Ukraine. Sehr weit westlich gelegene Fundgebiete wurden aus Spanien berichtet, im zentralen Europa ist die Gattung eher sporadisch anzutreffen. Östliche Nachweise reichen bis nach Ostasien, beschränken sich bisher aber nur auf wenige Funde.', 'Paläobiologie.', 'Ernährungsweise.', 'Informationen zur Paläobiologie der Mammutiden allgemein und der Gattung \\"Mammut\\" speziell liegen überwiegend für das Amerikanische Mastodon vor, das als terminale Form der Rüsseltierlinie noch bis in das ausge: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"1.

Die Gruppe umfasst vor allem igel- und spitzmausähnliche Vertreter. Die nicht allzu großen Säugetiere sind hauptsächlich nachtaktiv, leben weitgehend einzelgängerisch und ernähren sich von Wirbellosen. Sie haben sich an unterschiedliche Lebensweisen angepasst. So gibt es unter den Tenreks grabende, bodenbewohnende, baumkletternde und im Wasser lebende Formen. Dadurch nutzen die Tiere verschiedene ökologische Nischen, die aufgrund fehlender Konkurrenten unter den Säugetieren auf Madagaskar unbesetzt geblieben waren. Diese Vielfältigkeit reduziert gleichzeitig die innerartliche Konkurrenz und führte zu mehr als 30 Arten, die sich aufgrund ihrer abweichenden Lebensweise auch im Körperbau teils deutlich unterscheiden. Insgesamt stellen die Tenreks so ein Paradebeispiel adaptiver Radiation dar. Darüber hinaus weisen die einzelnen Tenrekarten mitunter Eigenschaften auf, die auch für andere höhere Säugetiere eher ungewöhnlich sind. Hierzu gehören die stark schwankende Körpertemperatur und das Eintreten eines Torpors unter tropischen Bedingungen, das Vermögen einiger Igeltenreks, mit den Stacheln ihres Fellkleids zu stridulieren, sowie die teils extrem kurze Generationenfolge und die vor allem beim Großen Tenrek belegte hohe Anzahl an Neugeborenen.', 'Die erste Erwähnung von Tenreks durch westliche Naturforscher und Reisende erfolgte bereits in der Mitte des 17. Jahrhunderts. Rund 100 Jahre später waren schon mehrere Formen bekannt, bei denen es sich aber durchweg um stachelhaarige Tenreks handelte. Anfänglich wurden die Tenreks daher mit den europäischen Igeln in Beziehung gesetzt. Die Etablierung als eigenständige Gruppe setzte sich im Übergang vom 18. zum 19. Jahrhundert durch. Das charakteristische Erscheinungsbild und die teils insektenfressende Ernährungsweise waren Ursache, dass die Tenreks im Laufe des 19. und des 20. Jahrhunderts in die große, in sich aber nicht einheitliche Gruppe der Insektenfresser (Lipotyphla) eingeordnet wurden. Zum Ende des 20. Jahrhunderts zeigten molekulargenetische Untersuchungen jedoch, dass die Tenreks und die mit ihnen am nächsten Verwandten Otterspitzmäuse (Potamogalidae) zusammen mit den Goldmullen (Chrysochloridae) eine eigene Säugetiergruppe bilden: die Tenrekartigen (Afrosoricida). Diese Gruppe steht wiederum anderen originär afrikanischen Säugetieren nahe, mit denen sie unter der Bezeichnung Afrotheria zusammengefasst werden.', 'Der Ursprung der Tenreks ist bisher unbekannt. Auf Madagaskar liegen keine Fossilien vor, die älter als das Holozän datieren. Vom kontinentalen Afrika sind ebenfalls nur wenige Reste belegt, die ältesten stammen aus dem Eozän Südwestafrikas. Weitere Funde kamen im östlichen Afrika zu Tage und datieren in das Untere Miozän. Wahrscheinlich entwickelte sich die Gruppe auf dem Kontinent, die Vorfahren der madagassischen Tenreks gelangten dann vor etwa vierzig bis zwanzig Millionen Jahren auf die Insel. Es ist aber in der Fachwelt bisher umstritten, ob Madagaskar in einer oder in mehreren Besiedlungswellen erreicht wurde. Die heutigen Tenreks sind sowohl an die feuchten Regenwälder des östlichen als auch an die trockeneren Landschaften des westlichen Inselteils angepasst. Fast ein Fünftel der heutigen Arten sind in ihrem Bestand mehr oder weniger bedroht.', 'Merkmale.', 'Habitus.', 'Die Tenreks bilden eine vielgestaltige Gruppe kleinerer Säugetiere. Die Kopf-Rumpf-Länge variiert beträchtlich, sie erreicht bei den kleinsten Arten wie dem Zwergkleintenrek (\\"Microgale parvula\\") oder dem Gnomkleintenrek (\\"Microgale pusilla\\") 4,7 bis 6,4 cm, bei der größten Art, dem Großen Tenrek beträgt sie 26,5 bis 39,0 cm. Das Gewicht schwankt dementsprechend von 2,6 bis 2400 g. Die meisten Arten weisen keinen sonderlichen Geschlechtsdimorphismus auf. Es lassen sich äußerlich zwei Formentypen unterscheiden. Die kleineren Arten wie die Reistenreks (Oryzorictinae) und Erdtenreks (Geogalinae) haben ein spitzmaus-, mitunter auch otterartiges Erscheinungsbild mit weichem Fell und langgezogenem Kopf. Die Schwanzlänge ist bei diesen variabel, es kommen Arten vor, deren Schwanz nur ein Drittel der Körperlänge ausmacht, bei anderen wiederum übertrifft er den restlichen Körper um mehr als das Doppelte an Länge. Die zweite Formengruppe, die Igeltenreks (Tenrecinae) zeichnet sich durch ein igelartiges Äußeres aus. Bei ihnen bildet der Schwanz nur einen kurzen Stummel, ihr Fell besteht aus Borsten und Stacheln. Allgemein variiert die Färbung des Fells der Tenreks von grau über braun bis schwarz, wobei die Unterseite meist heller gefärbt ist. Eine auffällige Musterung des Fells ist nur bei den Streifentenreks (\\"Hemicentetes\\") ausgebildet. Die Hände und Füße enden bei den Tenreks in jeweils fünf Zehen, eine Ausnahme bildet hier der Vierzehen-Reiswühler (\\"Oryzorictes tetradactylus\\"), der nur vierstrahlige Hände besitzt. Die Beine zeigen keinen auffallenden Längenunterschied, der Daumen und die Großzehe sind nicht opponierbar. Der Kopf wirkt vergleichsweise groß und kann wie beim Großen Tenrek gut ein Drittel der Körperlänge ausmachen. Die Schnauze ist allgemein lang und beweglich. Die Ohrlänge variiert je nach ökologischer Anpassung der Tiere zwischen vergleichsweise groß bis klein, die Augen bleiben meist klein. Im Gesicht treten auffällig lange Vibrissen auf.', 'Schädel- und Gebissmerkmale.', 'Der Schädel der Tenreks ist insgesamt langgestreckt und schmal sowie flach. Er besitzt ein lang ausgezogenes, häufig zylindrisch geformtes und vorn mehr oder weniger spitz zulaufendes Rostrum. Der Hirnschädel dagegen ist breiter, die größte Breite tritt hier meist an den Gelenkgruben für den Unterkiefer auf. Vor allem bei den Igeltenreks übertrifft das Rostrum den hinteren Schädelabschnitt deutlich an Länge und kann bis zu 60 % und mehr der Schädellänge einnehmen. Bei den Reistenreks ist das Rostrum dagegen kürzer und macht rund die Hälfte der Schädellänge aus. Auffälligstes Merkmal stellt der nicht geschlossene Jochbogen dar, was bei zahlreichen insektenfressenden Säugetieren vorkommt. Der Bereich hinter den Augen zieht häufig deutlich ein und ist langgestreckt. In der generellen Morphologie variieren die Schädel der Tenreks nur wenig, im Detail weisen sie eine hohe Vielfalt auf, die ihre teils unterschiedlichen Anpassungen widerspiegeln. So kann das Rostrum sehr schmal sein wie bei den Streifentenreks oder breiter wie beim Großen Tenrek beziehungsweise beim Großen Igeltenrek. Auch ist ein Scheitelkamm unterschiedlich ausgebildet und kommt etwa beim Großen Tenrek vor, fehlt aber bei den Streifentenreks. Ebenso ist der Hirnschädel im unterschiedlichen Maße gewölbt oder abgeflacht und unter Umständen mit weiteren Knochenwülsten als Muskelansatzstellen ausgestattet. Im Embryonalstadium gleichen die Schädel aller Tenreks weitgehend denen der Kleintenreks (\\"Microgale\\").', 'Das Gebiss setzt sich aus 32 bis 40 Zähnen zusammen, die Zahnformel lautet: formula_1. Als gemeinsames Merkmal aller Tenreks gilt das Fehlen des ersten Prämolaren. Im Bezug auf die vorderen Zähne unterscheiden sich die einzelnen Arten und Gattungen deutlich voneinander. Prinzipiell sind die Schneidezähne mit einer spitzen Zahnkrone ausgestattet, das Auftreten einzelner zusätzlicher Höckerchen vor und hinter der Hauptspitze variiert zwischen den einzelnen Arten. Der Eckzahn kann den Schneidezähnen gleichen, also \\"incisiviform\\" und sehr klein sein wie etwa bei den Kleintenreks oder den Streifentenrek oder aber wie bei den Reiswühlern und dem Großen Tenrek eher einem typischen Caninus (\\"caniniform\\") entsprechen, bei letzterem überragt er die Schneidezähne. Auch die Anordnung der vorderen Zähne bis einschließlich der Prämolaren zeigt starke Unterschiede, da bei vielen Arten jeweils unterschiedlich ausgeprägte Diastemata (Zahnzwischenräume) vorkommen. Im Bau der Prämolaren und der Molaren weichen die Tenreks weniger deutlich voneinander ab. Sie werden ebenfalls durch spitze Höckerchen geprägt, von denen die Molaren jeweils drei tragen (\\"tritubercular\\" oder \\"tricuspid\\"). Die drei Haupthöcker umfassen, bezogen auf die Oberkieferzähne, den Paraconus, den Metaconus und den Protoconus. Paraconus und Metaconus liegen eng beieinander, der Protoconus ist in seiner Größe reduziert, nicht so stark wie bei den Goldmullen, aber stärker als bei den Otterspitzmäusen. Zudem besteht eine V-förmige Scherleiste (Ectoloph) auf der Kauoberfläche. Aufgrund dieser Merkmale können die Molaren der Tenreks als typisch \\"zalambdodont\\" aufgefasst werden. Teilweise besteht zungenseitig ein Cingulum, ein Zahnschmelzwulst.', 'Skelettmerkmale.', 'Wie bei allen Afrotheria zeichnet sich die Wirbelsäule der Tenreks durch eine erhöhte Anzahl der Rückenwirbel (Brust- und Lendenwirbel) aus. Sie besteht aus 7 Hals-, 15 bis 19 Brust, 4 bis 7 Lenden- 2 bis 3 Kreuzbein- und 8 bis 52 Schwanzwirbeln. Dabei besitzen die Igeltenreks die kürzesten Schwänze mit nur 8 bis 10 Wirbeln, was in einem sehr kurzen Schwanzstummel resultiert. Der Kleine Langschwanz-Kleintenrek (\\"Microgale longicaudata\\") verfügt dagegen neben dem Langschwanzschuppentier über die höchste Anzahl an Schwanzwirbeln unter den heutigen Säugetieren, sein Schwanz erreicht häufig mehr als das Doppelte der Länge des restlichen Körpers.', 'Generell zeigen die Tenreks einen übereinstimmenden Skelettbau, allen gemeinsam ist das Vorhandensein eines Schlüsselbeins und das im unteren Bereich miteinander verwachsene Schien- und Wadenbein. Zudem wird das obere Sprunggelenk wie bei vielen anderen Höheren Säugetieren nur durch Schien- und Sprungbein gebildet. Allerdings ist das obere Sprunggelenk im Bezug auf die Stellung der Knöchel bei den Igeltenreks etwas anders konfiguriert als bei den Reistenreks. Dies führt dazu, dass erstere ihre Füße in Ruhestellung nach außen rotiert halten, während sie bei letzteren parallel zur Körperachse orientiert sind. Darüber hinaus spiegeln sich die teils recht unterschiedlichen Lebensweisen der Tenreks durch verschiedene Variationen im Bau des Bewegungsapparates wider.

Da unter diesen Voraussetzungen die Chancen, eine Anstellung als Schauspielerin zu finden, gering waren, verließ Grün ihre Heimatstadt und zog nach Berlin. Dort waren jedoch die Arbeitsmöglichkeiten nicht besser. Erich Kästner konstatierte im April 1929: „Man wird ohne Übertreibung annehmen dürfen, daß es in einer Stadt wie Berlin bedeutend mehr engagementslose Schauspieler gibt als solche mit Engagement“.

Gelegentlich werden ebenfalls die Offiziere des kaiserlichen Militärs mit diesem Begriff bezeichnet.', 'Mandarine waren Gelehrte, Richter und Beamte, die ihren Dienst in allen Bereichen der chinesischen Verwaltung versahen. Ihr Amt und die damit verbundenen Titel und Ränge wurden ihnen nach einer jahrelangen, elitären Ausbildung verliehen. Dabei waren sie einem rigorosen Auswahl- und Prüfungssystem unterworfen, das garantieren sollte, dass die Verwaltung des Landes nur durch die gelehrtesten und fähigsten Köpfe wahrgenommen wurde. Die Amtsausübung und -befähigung eines jeden Mandarins wurde regelmäßig streng kontrolliert. Im untersten Rang waren sie als Lehrer an Schulen tätig, in den höchsten Rängen waren sie einflussreiche wie vielrespektierte Verwalter, Berater und Gelehrte, aber auch Herolde und Diplomaten im Namen und Auftrag des Kaisers. Wichtigste Verwaltungszentren waren die Hauptstadt Peking () und Nanking (), das als Ersatzhauptstadt vorgesehen war. Mandarine sind bis heute für ihre seidenen, prachtvollen Hoftrachten bekannt, die mit Wappentieren bestickt und in streng vorgegebenen Farben geschmückt waren und so den Rang und die Stellung bei Hofe aufzeigten. Das traditionelle Patriarchat prägte sowohl das Amtswesen als auch das Familienleben; Frauen war nicht gestattet, das Amt eines Mandarins auszuüben. Die Macht und der Einfluss der Mandarine sowie ihr striktes und strenges Verwaltungssystem bildeten das Rückgrat des chinesischen Imperiums, das mit dieser Institution für mehr als fünf Jahrhunderte wuchs und gedieh.', 'Etymologie.', 'Das Wort \\"Mandarin\\" stammt wahrscheinlich über die Vermittlung des Portugiesischen vom malaiischen Wort \\"mantari\\" ‚Berater, Verwalter, Minister‘, das seinerseits von gleichbedeutend hindust. \\"mantrī\\" () &lt; Sanskrit \\"mantrín-\\" entlehnt ist und in Süd- und Südostasien als Titel für Staatsdiener und Würdenträger weit verbreitet war, nicht jedoch in China. Erst die portugiesischen Seefahrer des 16. Jahrhunderts, die zunächst Indien und Malaya, dann China erreichten, übertrugen das Wort auf die chinesische Verwaltung. Der Lautwandel von \\"t\\" zu \\"d\\" erfolgte vermutlich durch Anlehnung an das portugiesische Wort \\"mandar\\" ‚befehlen‘. In der Form \\"mandarim\\", später \\"mandarin\\", niederländisch auch \\"mandarijn\\", \\"mandorijn\\", fand das Wort Eingang in die europäischen Sprachen.

Der Gebrauch des Begriffs \\"guān\\" – im feudalen China entspricht etwa dem westlichen Begriff Mandarin.', 'Geschichte.', 'Eine Auswahl der Beamten durch Prüfungen war in China eine Tradition, die bereits auf die Han-Dynastie (206 v. Chr. – 220 n. Chr.) zurückgeht, aber erst während der Ming-Dynastie (1368–1644) erreichte diese Praxis ihre höchste Blüte. Kaiser Hóngwǔ begann seine Herrschaft mit weitreichenden Säuberungen, denen Zehntausende, darunter Adlige und hochrangige Beamte, zum Opfer fielen. Im Jahr 1380 reorganisierte er die Zentralverwaltung des Reiches. Die zuvor existierenden Einrichtungen wurden entmachtet, das Hauptbüro wurde aufgelöst, es blieben sechs Ministerien mit jeweils untereinander gleichberechtigten Ministern an der Spitze, die direkt dem Kaiser unterstellt waren. Die vorherige zentrale Militärkommission wurde ebenfalls aufgelöst und in fünf Einheiten unterteilt; jede war selbständig, ihre Kommandanten untereinander gleichberechtigt.', 'Die zur Zeit der Machtübernahme durch Hóngwǔ vorhandenen ca. 5000 Beamtenstellen wurden zunächst auf Empfehlung der regionalen Adligen besetzt, deren Länder in das Reich integriert worden waren. Soweit möglich wurden die Empfohlenen für eine Befragung in die Hauptstadt beordert und ihnen anschließend ein Posten in der Zentral- oder auch Provinzialverwaltung zugewiesen. Ab dem Jahr 1368 wurden Agenten in die Provinzen des Landes entsandt, um geeignete Kandidaten ausfindig zu machen. Durch kaiserliche Erlasse wurde dazu aufgefordert, „intelligente und aufrichtige“, „würdige und ehrliche“, „treue und unbestechliche“ Personen für einen Beamtenposten vorzuschlagen. Selbst als das Prüfungssystem in der ersten Hälfte des 15. Jahrhunderts bereits etabliert war, wurden vereinzelt Beamte auf Empfehlung Adliger oder hochrangiger Würdenträger in ihr Amt bestellt. Vollständig zum Erliegen kam diese Praxis erst nach 1440.', 'Nach 1440 war die Absolvierung der Auswahlprüfungen der einzige Weg, der eine Laufbahn bis in die höchsten Beamtenposten ermöglichte. Die ersten Auswahlprüfungen der Ming-Dynastie begannen zwischen 1368 und 1371 und brachten 120 hauptstädtische Absolventen im Jahr 1371 hervor. Zunächst wurde das Prüfungssystem wieder aufgegeben, da der Kaiser die Absolventen letztlich nur als „Phrasendrescher“ empfand. In den Jahren 1384/85 fanden erneut Prüfungen statt, und von da an bis zum Ende der Dynastie insgesamt 90-mal. Fast 25.000 Kandidaten schlossen während der Dynastie erfolgreich die letzte und anspruchsvollste Prüfung in der Hauptstadt ab. Eine Quote, wie viele Prüflinge das abschließende Examen in der Hauptstadt bestehen konnten, war nicht vorgegeben. Die Zahl der erfolgreichen Abschlüsse schwankte im Lauf der Zeit zwischen 32 und 472, durchschnittlich absolvierten alle drei Jahre 276 Kandidaten die Prüfung erfolgreich. Die Prüfungen auf Provinzebene bestanden in der Zeit der Ming-Dynastie ca. 100.000, sodass für die am Ende der Ming-Dynastie 25.000 vorhandenen Posten in der Zivilverwaltung gerade eine ausreichende Anzahl geeigneter Personen vorhanden war.', 'Während der Qing-Dynastie veränderte sich das Prüfungssystem nur unwesentlich (siehe hierzu: Chinesische Beamtenprüfung während der Qing-Dynastie). Die im Dreijahresrhythmus stattfindenden hauptstädtischen Prüfungen brachten im Durchschnitt weniger Absolventen als in der vorhergehenden Dynastie hervor (239 Absolventen in jedem dritten Jahr). Da jedoch die am Ende der Ming-Dynastie aufgekommene Praxis zusätzlicher Prüfungstermine, z. B. anlässlich des kaiserlichen Geburtstags, fortgeführt wurde, erhielt eine weit größere Anzahl von Personen den formellen Status eines Absolventen der Hauptstadtprüfung. Diese Absolventen, die (), besetzten nach und nach alle der ca. 25.000 Stellen der Zivilverwaltung. Nach 1660 war es für jemanden, der nur die Prüfung auf Provinzebene bestanden hatte, nahezu unmöglich geworden, in einen offiziellen Beamtenrang aufzusteigen.', 'Zunehmender gesellschaftlicher Wohlstand ließ im Verlauf die Zahl derjenigen ansteigen, die über die Voraussetzungen für eine Beamtenlaufbahn verfügten. Um das Überangebot an Kandidaten einzuschränken, reduzierte die Regierung die Quote für die Anzahl der Absolventen der alle drei Jahre auf Provinzebene stattfindenden Prüfungen und verschärfte die Prüfungsbedingungen gegen Ende des 18. Jahrhunderts. Und dennoch gab es um 1700 bei einer Bevölkerung von 200 Millionen Menschen ca. 500.000 Männer, die für die Prüfungen auf Provinzebene zugelassen waren. Ein Jahrhundert später, um 1800, nahmen an den zweijährlichen, lokalen Prüfungen jeweils 2 Millionen Kandidaten teil (bei einer Gesamtbevölkerung von 300 Millionen). Um 1900, gegen Ende der Qing-Dynastie, verfügten zwischen 1,6 und 1,9 Prozent der Gesamtbevölkerung über einen durch Prüfungen erworbenen Gelehrtenstatus, allerdings, ohne dass damit auch gleichzeitig ein Amt als Beamter verbunden war.', 'Aufgegeben wurde das System der Beamtenprüfung schließlich im Jahr 1905, wenige Jahre vor dem Ende des Kaiserreichs und der Gründung der Republik.', 'Ämter.', 'Verwaltungsstruktur Chinas.', 'Die Verwaltung Chinas zur Kaiserzeit setzte sich aus drei Bereichen zusammen: dem Militär, gegliedert in fünf Hauptabteilungen bzw.

Jeder dieser Bestandteile hatte drei Ebenen: eine obere auf Hauptstadtebene, eine mittlere auf der Ebene der Provinzen und eine untere auf der Ebene der Präfekturen und Landkreise. Über allem stand der Kaiser als Letztverantwortlicher. Einen Ministerrat und einen Premierminister gab es seit der Machtübernahme Hóngwǔs nicht mehr. An deren Stelle hatte dieser im Jahr 1382 die Einrichtung der „Großsekretäre“ geschaffen: Gelehrte aus der Hanlin-Akademie, die als persönliche Berater des Kaisers fungierten und von denen jeder einen eigenen, vom Kaiser zugewiesenen Verantwortungsbereich hatte. Nominell gab es sechs dieser „Großsekretäre“, deren Stellen im Lauf der Zeit nicht immer alle besetzt waren, selten waren es aber gleichzeitig weniger als drei. Ab 1424 erhielten die „Großsekretäre“ eine Ernennung als höchstrangige Beamte und den zugehörigen Ehrentitel (Rang 1 a und 1 b). Sie hatten Vorrang vor allen anderen Beamten der Zivilverwaltung.

Genau genommen gibt es, zusammen mit den beiden unten genannten Ergänzungssätzen, ein Verfahren an, um zu entscheiden, ob eine Zahl quadratischer Rest oder Nichtrest einer Primzahl ist. Die Entdeckung des quadratischen Reziprozitätsgesetzes durch Leonhard Euler und der Beweis durch Gauß (Disquisitiones Arithmeticae 1801, er hatte aber bereits 1796 einen Beweis) waren die Ausgangspunkte der Entwicklung der modernen algebraischen Zahlentheorie.', 'Um die genaue Aussage des quadratische Reziprozitätsgesetzes zu verstehen, sind lediglich die Konzepte der Quadratzahlen, der Primzahlen und der Teilbarkeit ganzer Zahlen mit Rest vonnöten.

Im Zentrum steht die folgende Fragestellung:', 'Innerhalb dieser Fragestellung haben die beiden Primzahlen formula_2 und formula_7 eine \\"unterschiedliche\\" Stellung (formula_2 ist „Teiler“ und formula_7 ist „Subtrahend“). Das Wort „Reziprozität“ (von „reziprok“, also \\"wechselseitig\\") deutet nun an, dass dieselbe Frage ebenfalls unter Vertauschung der Rollen beider Primzahlen gefragt werden kann: Gibt es also eine (zweite) Quadratzahl formula_20, sodass formula_7 wiederum die Differenz formula_22 teilt? Das quadratische Reziprozitätsgesetz formuliert eine einfache Regel, die die Lösbarkeit der zwei Aufgaben, die durch \\"Vertauschen der Rollen beider Primzahlen\\" entstehen, miteinander in Beziehung setzt. Es unterscheidet:', 'Das quadratische Reziprozitätsgesetz ist aus mathematischer Sicht unter anderem von Interesse, da es kausale Zusammenhänge zwischen scheinbar völlig verschiedenen Fragestellungen aufbaut. Das führt dazu, dass die Lösung einer mitunter sehr schweren Aufgabe auf das Lösen einer leichten Aufgabe zurückgeführt werden kann, weshalb es für konkrete Berechnungen von Nutzen ist. Zahlreiche Anwendungen findet es in der Zahlentheorie, der Theorie diophantischer Gleichungen, aber auch in praktischen Gebieten wie der Kryptographie.', 'Gauß selbst hat acht methodisch verschiedene Beweise für das quadratische Reziprozitätsgesetz vorgelegt. Da er die Bedeutung des Resultats bereits als außerordentlich hoch erkannte, bezeichnete er sein Resultat als „Fundamentaltheorem“ bzw. „\\"Theorema aureum\\"“ (deutsch: „Goldener Satz“) der Zahlentheorie. Die Bezeichnung „Reziprozitätsgesetz“ geht indes auf Adrien-Marie Legendre zurück, der im Jahr 1785 einen unvollständigen Beweis lieferte. Spätere (vollständige) Beweise stammen unter anderem von Gotthold Eisenstein, Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, Richard Dedekind und Jegor Iwanowitsch Solotarjow. Bis heute sind mehr als 300 verschiedene Beweise publiziert worden. Trotz elementarer Beweise liegt das Wesen der „Reziprozität“, wie schon Gauß vermutete, relativ tief, nämlich in der Primfaktorzerlegung in den Kreisteilungskörpern.', 'Das quadratische Reziprozitätsgesetz macht Aussagen über die Lösbarkeit quadratischer Gleichungen in der modularen Arithmetik. Die Frage nach der Lösbarkeit von Gleichungen höheren Grades führt auf die höheren Reziprozitätsgesetze, was eine der treibenden Kräfte der algebraischen Zahlentheorie seit Gauß war. Den Fall dritten Grades, das kubische Reziprozitätsgesetz, behandelte Gotthold Eisenstein, den Fall vierten Grades Gauß, wobei jedoch Carl Gustav Jacobi den ersten vollständigen Beweis vorlegte. Eine moderne, sehr viel tiefer liegende, Verallgemeinerung findet sich in den Grundlagen der Klassenkörpertheorie.', 'Fragestellung und Grundlagen.', 'Das quadratische Reziprozitätsgesetz motiviert sich aus der Aufgabe, schnell über die Lösbarkeit quadratischer Kongruenzen entscheiden zu können. Im Falle von Primzahlen entspricht dies einer quadratischen Gleichung über einem endlichen Körper. Für ein genaues Verständnis seiner Aussage werden die folgenden Grundlagen zusammengefasst.', 'Endliche Körper.', 'In der Mathematik bezeichnet ein Körper eine Menge, innerhalb der, einfach gesprochen, mit den vier Grundrechenarten gerechnet werden kann. Dabei sollen die aus der Schulmathematik bekannten Regeln des Kommutativgesetzes (Vertauschbarkeit bei „Plus“ und „Mal“), Assoziativgesetzes (Vertauschbarkeit von Klammern bei „nur Plus“ oder „nur Mal“) und Distributivgesetzes („Ausklammern“ und „Ausmultiplizieren“) gelten. Außerdem muss stets das Element formula_61 (\\"neutrales Element der Addition\\") und formula_26 (\\"neutrales Element der Multiplikation\\") Teil eines Körpers sein. Insbesondere soll durch jede Zahl ungleich der formula_61 dividiert werden können. Wichtige Beispiele sind der Körper der reellen Zahlen (Bezeichnung: formula_64) oder der Körper der rationalen Zahlen (Bezeichnung: formula_65).', 'Eine wichtige Forderung ist, dass keine der erlaubten Rechenoperationen dazu führt, dass man die den Körper definierende Zahlenmenge verlässt. So ist es etwa in Körpern im Allgemeinen \\"nicht\\" erlaubt, Quadratwurzeln zu ziehen. Es ist formula_66 ein Element von formula_65, kurz formula_68, aber formula_69 ist eine irrationale Zahl, also formula_70. Ähnlich besitzt formula_71 keine Quadratwurzel in den reellen Zahlen. Grundsätzlich ist das Konzept einer Quadratwurzel in einem Körper aber indirekt erklärt, da die umgekehrte Operation, nämlich die \\"Multiplikation\\" einer Zahl mit sich selbst, in Körpern definiert ist, wobei die Existenz eine andere Frage ist.', 'Eine Fragestellung aus der Algebra ist, wie Körper aussehen können, also in welchen Typen von Mengen ein „abgeschlossenes Rechnen“ möglich ist. So kann man weitere nichtrationale Zahlen zu formula_65 hinzunehmen, um größere Körper zu konstruieren. Ein Beispiel ist der Körper formula_73, der aus allen Zahlen formula_74 mit formula_75 besteht (siehe auch: Zahlkörper, und zum Beispiel Quadratischer Zahlkörper). Rechnungen wie','sind Prototypen für die Abgeschlossenheit der vier Grundrechenarten in formula_73. Es ist formula_73, zusammen mit formula_65 und formula_64, ein weiteres Beispiel für einen Körper mit unendlich vielen Elementen. Bemerkenswert ist es aber, dass auch Körper formula_81 mit nur \\"endlich vielen\\" Elementen existieren. Das Rechnen in diesen Bereichen weicht, obwohl die Gesetze letztlich die gleichen sind, von der „klassischen Anschauung“ ab. Das beginnt damit, dass die Elemente', 'nicht alle verschieden sein können, da formula_81 nur endlich viele Elemente hat.

Diese Kennzahl wird \\"Charakteristik des Körpers formula_81\\" genannt, also formula_90. Sie ist stets eine Primzahl, denn wäre zum Beispiel formula_91 zusammengesetzt, so müsste formula_92 sein, und es wäre bereits formula_93 oder formula_94, also formula_95, was der Annahme formula_96 wegen der Minimalität der Charakteristik direkt widerspräche.', 'Um das Rechnen in endlichen Körpern genau zu verstehen, ist der Umgang mit Resten bei Divisionsaufgaben notwendig. Nichttriviale Reste entstehen bei Divisionen, die nicht aufgehen. Etwa ist formula_36 geteilt durch formula_15 gleich formula_45 mit Rest formula_25. In den einfachsten Beispielen endlicher Körper wird mit genau diesen Resten gerechnet. Dies kann anhand eines Beispiels demonstriert werden: Es gibt genau fünf mögliche Reste bei der Division durch formula_15, und diese korrespondieren zu','mit formula_103 Menge der ganzen Zahlen, und formula_104 (d. h. alle ganzen Vielfache der Zahl formula_15).

Etwa besteht', 'aus genau jenen Zahlen, die bei Division mit formula_15 den Rest formula_25 haben.

Man sieht damit, dass additive Vielfache von formula_15 in diesem Beispiel für die Zugehörigkeit zur gleichen Restklasse stets keine Rolle spielen. Mit anderen Worten: Während eine ganze Zahl stets erst durch ihre Zähl\\"größe\\" vollständig bestimmt ist, handelt es sich bei Restklassen um \\"reduzierte\\" Zahlen. \\"Nur\\" noch der Rest ist entscheidend, nicht mehr die Größe.', 'Mit Restklassen \\"modulo\\" formula_15 kann nun in den vier Grundrechenarten gerechnet werden. Dabei gelten im Grunde dieselben Regeln wie beim Rechnen in den ganzen Zahlen formula_117: Zum Beispiel ist', 'Wichtig ist an dieser Stelle, zu zeigen, dass dies \\"wohldefiniert\\" ist, dass also bei der Auswahl anderer Repräsentanten stets das gleiche Ergebnis herauskommt. Da die Differenz zweier Repräsentanten aber stets durch formula_15 teilbar ist, liegt dies auf der Hand: Zum Beispiel ist (vgl. oberes Beispiel)', 'aber auch', 'Ganz ähnliche Überlegungen gelten bei der Wohldefiniertheit der Multiplikation.', 'Auch die Division ist innerhalb von formula_141 möglich (schließt man formula_142 aus), denn um allgemein dividieren zu können, ist für jedes formula_1 lediglich die Existenz eines Inversen formula_144 mit', 'vonnöten (wie etwa formula_45 und formula_147 im Fall der rationalen Zahlen).

Chr. permanent bewohnt. Zwischen 100 und 650 n. Chr. bildete die Stadt das dominierende kulturelle, wirtschaftliche und militärische Zentrum Mesoamerikas. Auf dem Höhepunkt ihrer Entwicklung hatte sie möglicherweise bis zu 200.000 Einwohner. Sie war zu ihrer Zeit die mit Abstand größte Stadt auf dem amerikanischen Kontinent und eine der größten der Welt. Ab etwa 650 schwand ihre Bedeutung, bis sie um 750 aus nicht vollständig geklärten Gründen weitgehend verlassen wurde. Ihre kulturellen Einflüsse prägten Zentralmexiko aber noch bis zur spanischen Eroberung Mexikos. Weil Teotihuacán keine geschriebene Sprache kannte, sind Erkenntnisse über diese Kultur nur aus der Interpretation von archäologischen Funden ableitbar.', 'Die Azteken fanden Teotihuacan bei ihrer Einwanderung ins Hochland von Mexiko bereits als Ruinenstadt vor, die seit Jahrhunderten verlassen war. Sie sahen in ihr einen mythischen Ort und gaben ihr den bis heute fortlebenden Namen Teotihuacan (\\"Tēotīhuacān\\"), der so viel bedeutet wie \\"Wo man zu einem Gott wird\\".', 'In der Stadt wird seit Ankunft der Spanier im 16.

Dieses umfasst ein Gebiet von gut 500 bis 600 Quadratkilometern und wird im Norden durch mehrere erloschene Vulkane sowie im Süden durch eine Gebirgskette mit Bergen von bis zu 2800 Metern Höhe begrenzt. Durchflossen wird das Tal vom Río San Juan, der saisonal durch mehrere kleinere Quellen gespeist wird und heute in den Xaltocan-See mündet.', 'Im Tal von Teotihuacán herrscht ein warmgemäßigtes Klima; zwischen 1921 und 1968 wurde ein durchschnittlicher Jahresniederschlag von 550 Millimetern und eine Jahresdurchschnittstemperatur von 14,8 Grad Celsius gemessen. Der Winter beginnt üblicherweise im Oktober und kann bis in den Mai hinein andauern. Danach beginnt die bis Oktober dauernde Regenzeit, wobei der größte Teil des Regens in den Sommermonaten fällt.', 'Für die Landwirtschaft ist das Tal nur bedingt geeignet. Während der Ostteil vor allem flachgründige Böden aufweist und kaum Wasser vorhanden ist, gibt es im Westteil tiefergehende Alluvialböden, und der San Juan führt hier aufgrund einiger Quellen ganzjährig Wasser. Daneben gibt es in unmittelbarer Nähe aber auch größere Vorkommen von nutzbaren Rohstoffen, etwa Obsidian (vor allem am Ostrand des Tals), Kalkstein, Tonminerale und mehrere Arten von Vulkangestein. Die Flora bestand vermutlich aus Wäldern mit Eichen und Zypressen in den feuchteren sowie verschiedenen Sträuchern in den trockeneren Gebieten. An für den Menschen nutzbarer Fauna existierten mehrere Hasen- und Kaninchenarten, Nagetiere, Vögel, Reptilien sowie eine Hirschart, der Weißwedelhirsch.', 'Stadtanlage.', 'Die Stadt Teotihuacán nahm auf dem Höhepunkt ihrer Entwicklung eine Fläche von mehr als 20 Quadratkilometern ein. Die Anlage der Stadt erfolgte auf der Grundlage einer Rasteranordnung, die genauestens befolgt wurde. So wurde etwa auch der Río San Juan, der die Stadt durchfließt, durch Kanalisierung dem Raster angepasst.', 'Die Hauptachse der Stadt bildet die sogenannte Straße der Toten (in Nahuatl: \\"miccaotli\\"), die die Stadt mit einer Abweichung von 15° 30′ nach Osten in Nord-Süd-Richtung durchzieht, jedoch nicht durchgehend, da sie immer wieder durch Treppendämme unterbrochen wird. Das nördliche Ende der Straße bildet die Mondpyramide mit dem ihr vorgelagerten Platz und dem anliegenden \\"Quetzalpapalotl\\"-Palast. Im Süden läuft sie am Großen Komplex \\"(Great Compound)\\" und dem diesem gegenüberliegenden Tempel des Quetzalcoatl vorbei auf den Berg Cerro Gordo zu, auf dessen Gipfel ein Tempel errichtet war. Dort befindet sich auch der große Hofkomplex, die \\"ciudadela\\" (Zitadelle), in der möglicherweise die Herrscherfamilie oder deren direkte Untergebene lebten.

Vor ihr befindet sich die \\"plataforma adosada\\" (zu deutsch etwa „angeschlossene Plattform“), die als Zeremonialplatz gedient haben könnte. Die Zone, in der sich die größten Pyramiden sowie die oben erwähnten Wohnhäuser der Oberschicht befanden, war durch eine Mauer von der übrigen Stadt abgetrennt. Die meisten Gebäude außerhalb davon wurden als sogenannte \\"Apartment-Compounds\\" identifiziert, große Wohnkomplexe, die für mehrere Familien ausgelegt waren. Sie waren jeweils in Gruppen (\\"barrios\\", spanisch für Wohnviertel) zusammengeschlossen, die sich wiederum um einen größeren Compound gruppierten, der einen eigenen Tempelkomplex besaß. Es gab auch Viertel, die von Angehörigen anderer Völker bewohnt wurden, so etwa von Zapoteken, Mixteken und auch Maya.', 'Im Nordwesten Teotihuacáns befand sich einer der ältesten Teile der Stadt mit einer verhältnismäßig hohen Bevölkerungsdichte und vielen Tempeln aus der Frühzeit der Stadt.

Der archäologische Laie Leopoldo Batres versuchte 1906 bei der Freilegung, die Pyramide zu restaurieren und ging dabei von der Existenz von fünf Stufen aus. Tatsächlich entstand die heutige fünfte Stufe überhaupt erst durch Batres’ Arbeiten aufgrund dieser Annahme. An der Seite, die zur Straße der Toten weist, führt eine Treppe über die an der Pyramide angeschlossene \\"plataforma adosada\\" auf die Spitze.

Dort wurden neben Artefakten aus der Zeit Teotihuacáns auch Gegenstände aus aztekischer Zeit gefunden. Da außerdem in späteren mesoamerikanischen Religionen Höhlen immer wieder als Orte der Schöpfung galten, wird davon ausgegangen, dass die Pyramide religiösen Zwecken diente. Welchem Gott die Sonnenpyramide geweiht war, ist noch nicht gesichert. Heute existieren keine Malereien mehr, die die Verehrung eines bestimmten Gottes belegen könnten; es wurde lediglich ein Gefäß mit einer Abbildung des „Sturmgottes“ (oft mit dem späteren aztekischen Gott Tlaloc identifiziert) gefunden, was aber allein ebenfalls kein stichhaltiger Beweis dafür ist, dass dieser Gott hier auch verehrt wurde.', 'Die Kunsthistorikerin Esther Pasztory von der amerikanischen Columbia University bringt die Pyramide dennoch mit einer bestimmten Gottheit in Verbindung, der „Großen Göttin“. Von ihr existieren einige Abbildungen, die darauf deuten, dass sie eine Fruchtbarkeitsgöttin war. In einigen Fällen wird sie darauf auch mit Höhlen in Verbindung gebracht. Pasztorys Annahme beruht nun auf der Häufigkeit von Abbildungen der Großen Göttin und der daraus resultierenden großen Bedeutung und auf der Interpretation der Höhle als typisch weibliches Symbol.', 'Mondpyramide.', 'Die am nördlichen Ende der Straße der Toten gelegene Mondpyramide entstand rund ein Jahrhundert nach der Sonnenpyramide.

Die Aufgabe besteht darin, aus einem gegebenen Kreis in endlich vielen Schritten ein Quadrat mit dem gleichen Flächeninhalt zu konstruieren. Sie ist äquivalent zur sogenannten Rektifikation des Kreises, also der Konstruktion einer geraden Strecke, die dem Kreisumfang entspricht. Das wiederum entspricht der Konstruktion der Kreiszahl formula_1 (halber Kreisumfang) aus der Strecke, deren Länge gleich formula_2 Längenmaßeinheit ist. Beschränkt man die Konstruktionsmittel auf Lineal und Zirkel, so ist die Aufgabe aufgrund der Transzendenz von formula_1 unlösbar. Erst im Jahre 1882 konnte dies von dem deutschen Mathematiker Ferdinand von Lindemann bewiesen werden.', 'Die Quadratur des Kreises gehört zu den populärsten Problemen der Mathematik. Jahrhundertelang suchten neben Mathematikern auch immer wieder Laien vergeblich nach einer Lösung. Der Begriff \\"Quadratur des Kreises\\" ist in vielen Sprachen zu einer Metapher für eine unlösbare Aufgabe geworden.', 'Geschichte.', 'Vorgeschichte.', 'Bereits in den altorientalischen Hochkulturen gab es Verfahren zur Berechnung von Kreisflächen. Beispielsweise wird im Papyrus Rhind (um 1550 v. Chr.) der Durchmesser des Kreises in 9 Teile geteilt. Sein genauer Flächeninhalt in diesen Einheiten ist formula_4. Dieser Wert wird dann durch ein Quadrat der Kantenlänge 8 angenähert, also durch formula_5 (siehe hierzu \\"Aus dem Papyrus Rhind\\"). In einem zweiten Verfahren wird der Kreis durch ein unregelmäßiges Achteck angenähert. Dazu werden von dem 9×9-Quadrat, in das er einbeschrieben ist, an allen vier Ecken gleiche Dreiecke mit zusammen 18 Flächeneinheiten abgeschnitten, sodass 63 übrig bleiben. Derartige Musterlösungen waren aus der Praxis gewonnen und für die Praxis bestimmt, es gab keine weitergehenden theoretischen Überlegungen, insbesondere wurde kein Unterschied zwischen exakter Lösung und Näherung gemacht.', 'Eine deduktive Vorgehensweise in der Mathematik, bei der durch Beweise gestützte Sätze die Musteraufgaben ersetzen, entwickelte sich ab dem 6. Jahrhundert v. Chr. in Griechenland. Ansatzweise ist sie schon bei Thales von Milet, deutlicher in der von Pythagoras von Samos gegründeten Schule der Pythagoreer zu erkennen. Mit der gemeinhin dem Pythagoreer Hippasos von Metapont zugeschriebenen Entdeckung inkommensurabler Strecken im späten 6. oder frühen 5. Jahrhundert v. Chr. stellte sich heraus, dass es konstruierbare Objekte gibt (beispielsweise die Diagonale eines Quadrats), die nicht als ganzzahliges Verhältnis darstellbar sind. Dies schien bemerkenswert, da die einzigen bekannten Arten von Zahlen die ganzen Zahlen und die Verhältnisse ganzer Zahlen (im heutigen Sprachgebrauch die „rationalen Zahlen“) waren. Beliebige geometrische Strecken mussten dementsprechend stets kommensurabel sein, also in einem ganzzahligen Längenverhältnis zueinander stehen. Durch die Entdeckung waren nun Längen geometrisch konstruierbar, die arithmetisch nicht als „Zahl“ im bisherigen Sinn darstellbar waren (im heutigen Sprachgebrauch handelt es sich um „irrationale Zahlen“). Die Geometrie konnte plötzlich mehr darstellen, als die Arithmetik es vermochte. Als Folge dieser Entdeckung trat die Arithmetik zugunsten der Geometrie in den Hintergrund, Gleichungen mussten jetzt geometrisch gelöst werden, etwa durch Aneinanderlegung von Figuren und Überführung verschiedener Figuren in Rechtecke oder Quadrate. Aus dem späten 5. Jahrhundert stammen die drei klassischen Konstruktionsprobleme der antiken Mathematik, neben der Quadratur des Kreises noch die Aufgabe der Dreiteilung des Winkels und das Delische Problem der Verdoppelung des Würfels.', 'Eine Beschränkung der Konstruktionsmittel auf Zirkel und Lineal wurde dabei nicht generell gefordert. Während der Beschäftigung mit den klassischen Problemen wurden schon früh Lösungen gefunden, die auf weitergehenden Hilfsmitteln basieren. Allerdings kristallisierte sich im Lauf der Zeit eine Haltung heraus, die eine möglichst weitgehende Beschränkung verlangt. Spätestens bei Pappos war diese weitestgehende Beschränkung zur Maßregel geworden.', 'Frühe Arbeiten.', 'Als einer der ersten soll dem griechischen Schriftsteller Plutarch zufolge der Philosoph Anaxagoras „im Gefängnis die Quadratur des Kreises aufgeschrieben (oder: gezeichnet, )“ haben, nähere Angaben zu Anaxagoras’ Konstruktion macht Plutarch nicht. Ein Gefängnisaufenthalt des Anaxagoras wäre auf etwa 430 v. Chr. zu datieren, als der Philosoph in Athen wegen Gottlosigkeit angeklagt war.', 'Ausführlichere Quellen zu den Anfängen der Forschung sind hauptsächlich spätantike Kommentare zu Werken des Aristoteles, Schriften also, die mit einer zeitlichen Distanz von rund 900 Jahren entstanden sind. Dementsprechend unsicher sind zeitliche Reihenfolge und genaue Gedankengänge der ersten Ansätze. Die wichtigsten Arbeiten des 5. Jahrhunderts v. Chr. stammen von Hippokrates von Chios, Antiphon, Bryson von Herakleia und Hippias von Elis.', 'Die Überführung von Dreiecken in Rechtecke, von Rechtecken in Quadrate (Quadratur des Rechtecks) oder die Addition zweier Quadrate (Satz des Pythagoras) war mit den bekannten geometrischen Sätzen bereits damals elementar zu bewältigen. Hippokrates von Chios konnte um 440 v. Chr. ein Beispiel für eine krummlinig begrenzte Fläche geben, die exakt in ein Quadrat überführt werden konnte. Ausgehend von dem bei ihm noch als Axiom benutzten Satz, dass sich die Flächeninhalte ähnlicher Kreissegmente wie die Quadrate über ihren Sehnen verhalten, gelang es Hippokrates, von Kreisbögen begrenzte Flächen, die sogenannten „Möndchen des Hippokrates“, zu quadrieren. Die Quadratur des Kreises ist auf diese Weise jedoch nicht zu erreichen, da nur bestimmte Möndchen – zum Beispiel die über der Seite des Quadrats, nicht jedoch die über der Seite eines regelmäßigen Sechsecks – quadrierbar sind.', 'Dass Dreiecke (und damit beliebige Vielecke) in ein Quadrat übergeführt werden konnten, war ein zweiter Ansatz, ein dem Kreis flächengleiches Polygon zu konstruieren. Antiphon hatte die Idee, den Kreis durch einbeschriebene Vielecke anzunähern. Bryson von Herakleia verfeinerte dieses Vorgehen, indem er den Kreis zusätzlich durch umbeschriebene Vielecke näherte und einen Zwischenwert bildete.', 'Hippias von Elis entwickelte etwa 425 v. Chr. zur Lösung der Winkeldreiteilung eine Kurve, die mechanisch durch die Überlagerung einer kreisförmigen mit einer linearen Bewegung erzeugt wurde. Gut hundert Jahre später entdeckte Deinostratos, dass mithilfe dieser Kurve, der sogenannten Quadratrix, die Strecke der Länge formula_6 – und damit mithilfe weiterer elementarer Konstruktionen ein Quadrat mit dem Flächeninhalt formula_1 – konstruiert werden kann. Da die Quadratrix selbst jedoch eine sogenannte\\" transzendente Kurve\\" ist (siehe hierzu \\"Beweis der Unmöglichkeit\\"), also nicht mit Zirkel und Lineal zu erzeugen ist, war die Lösung im strengen Sinne damit nicht erreicht.', 'Archimedes.', 'Eine ausführliche Abhandlung mit dem Titel \\"Kreismessung\\" ist von Archimedes überliefert. Archimedes bewies in dieser Arbeit drei grundlegende Sätze:', 'Mit dem ersten Satz wurde das Problem der Quadratur des Kreises auf die Frage nach der Konstruierbarkeit des Umfangs eines Kreises aus dem vorgegebenen Radius und damit auf die Konstruierbarkeit von formula_1 zurückgeführt. Im dritten Satz gab Archimedes gleich eine ebenso einfache wie genaue Näherung dieser Zahl an, nämlich, ein Wert (≈ 3,143), der für praktische Zwecke noch heute Verwendung findet. Der zweite Satz ist ein einfaches Korollar aus den beiden anderen; dass sich der Flächeninhalt eines Kreises proportional zum Quadrat seines Durchmessers verhält, und war bereits Euklid bekannt. Archimedes gab hier den Wert der Proportionalitätskonstanten an.', 'Zum Beweis seiner Aussagen zog Archimedes die Idee des Bryson von Herakleia heran, mit der man eine beliebige Annäherung des Kreises durch ein- und umbeschriebene regelmäßige Polygone erreicht. Ausgehend vom einbeschriebenen Sechseck und umbeschriebenen Dreieck gelangte Archimedes durch sukzessive Verdoppelung der Seitenzahl jeweils beim 96-Eck an. Eine geschickte Abschätzung der in den einzelnen Rechenschritten auftretenden Quadratwurzeln ergab seine in Satz 3 genannten Schranken.', 'In einer weiteren Arbeit \\"Über Spiralen\\" beschrieb Archimedes die Konstruktion der später nach ihm benannten archimedischen Spirale, die ähnlich wie Hippias’ Quadratrix durch die Überlagerung einer kreisförmigen mit einer linearen Bewegung gewonnen wird. Er zeigte, dass durch das Anlegen der Tangente an diese Spirale der Umfang eines Kreises auf einer Geraden abgetragen werden kann, wodurch eine Quadratur des Kreises möglich wird. Die (nicht-klassische) Lösung mit seiner Spirale wird im Abschnitt \\"Quadratur des Kreises mithilfe der archimedischen Spirale\\" beschrieben. Wie bei der Quadratrix sind allerdings weder seine Spirale selbst noch etwa ihre Tangente mit Zirkel und Lineal konstruierbar.', 'Mittelalter.', 'Infolge eines verstärkten Interesses für die antike Mathematik im christlichen Europa ab etwa dem 11. Jahrhundert entstanden etliche Abhandlungen über die Quadratur des Kreises, jedoch ohne dass dabei wesentliche Beiträge zur eigentlichen Lösung geleistet wurden. Als Rückschritt zu betrachten ist, dass im Mittelalter der Archimedische Näherungswert von für die Kreiszahl lange Zeit als exakt galt.', 'Einer der ersten Autoren des Mittelalters, der das Problem der Kreisquadratur wiederaufnahm, war Franco von Lüttich. Um 1050 entstand sein Werk \\"De quadratura circuli.\\" Franco stellt darin zunächst drei Quadraturen vor, die er verwirft. Die ersten beiden geben für die Seitenlänge des Quadrates beziehungsweise für die Diagonale des Kreisdurchmessers an, was relativ schlechten Näherungen von und für formula_1 entspricht. Der dritte Vorschlag wiederum setzt den Umfang des Quadrates dem Kreisumfang gleich, verlangt also die Rektifikation des letzteren.', 'Francos eigene Lösung geht von einem Kreis mit Durchmesser 14 aus. Dessen Fläche setzt er als genau 7² × = 154 an.

If an HDL particle arrives at our crime scene, with the foam cells and fatty streaks, it can suck the cholesterol back out of the macrophages in a process called delipidation. It then slips back across the endothelial layer and into the bloodstream, to deliver the excess cholesterol back to the liver and other tissues (including fat cells and hormone-producing glands) for reuse. Its role in this process of “cholesterol efflux” is one reason why HDL is considered “good,” but it does more than that. Newer research suggests that HDL has multiple other atheroprotective functions that include helping maintain the integrity of the endothelium, lowering inflammation, and neutralizing or stopping the oxidation of LDL, like a kind of arterial antioxidant. The role of HDL is far less well understood than that of LDL. The cholesterol content in your LDL particles, your “bad” cholesterol number (technically expressed as LDL-C), [*3] is actually a decent if imperfect proxy for its biologic impact; lots of studies have shown a strong correlation between LDL-C and event risk. But the all-important “good cholesterol” number on your blood test, your HDL-C, doesn’t actually tell me very much if anything about your overall risk profile. Risk does seem to decline as HDLC rises to around the 80th percentile. But simply raising HDL cholesterol concentrations by brute force, with specialized drugs, has not been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk at all. The key seems to be to increase the functionality of the particles—but as yet we have no way to do that (or measure it). HDL may or may not explain why centenarians develop heart disease two decades later than average, if at all; remember, three of the most prominent “longevity genes” discovered to date are involved with cholesterol transport and processing (APOE and two others, CETP and APOC3). And it’s not just centenarians: I have patients walking around whose lipoprotein panels read like a death sentence, with sky-high LDL-C and apoB, but by every single measure that we have—calcium score, CT angiogram, you name it—they show no sign of disease. Yet as of now, we cannot give a satisfactory explanation for why. I feel strongly that if we are to make any further progress attacking cardiovascular disease with drugs, we must start by better understanding HDL and hopefully figuring out how to enhance its function. But I digress. Back at the crime scene, the ever-growing number of foam cells begin to sort of ooze together into a mass of lipids, like the liquefying contents of a pile of trash bags that have been dumped on the front lawn. This is what becomes the core of our atherosclerotic plaque. And this is the point where breaking and entering tilts over into full-scale looting. In an attempt to control the damage, the “smooth muscle” cells in the artery wall then migrate to this toxic waste site and secrete a kind of matrix in an attempt to build a kind of barrier around it, like a scar. This matrix ends up as the fibrous cap on your brand-new arterial plaque. More bad news: None of what’s gone on so far is easily detectable in the various tests we typically use to assess cardiovascular risk in patients. We might expect to see evidence of inflammation, such as elevated levels of Creactive protein, a popular (but poor) proxy of arterial inflammation. But it’s still mostly flying below our medical radar. If you look at the coronary arteries with a CT scan at this very early stage, you will likely miss this if you’re looking only for calcium buildup. (You have a better chance of spotting this level of damage if using a more advanced type of CT scan, called a CT angiogram, which I much prefer to a garden-variety calcium scan[*4] because it can also identify the noncalcified or “soft” plaque that precedes calcification.) As this maladaptive repair or remodeling process continues, the plaque will continue to grow. At first, this expansion is directed toward the outer arterial wall, but as it continues it may encroach on the lumen, the passage through which blood flows—in our analogy, blocking traffic in the street itself. This luminal narrowing, known as stenosis, can also be seen in an angiogram. At a certain point in this process, the plaque may start to become calcified. This is what (finally) shows up on a regular calcium scan. Calcification is merely another way in which the body is trying to repair the damage, by stabilizing the plaque to protect the all-important arteries. But it’s like pouring concrete on the Chernobyl reactor: you’re glad it’s there, but you know there’s been an awful lot of damage in the area to warrant such an intervention. A positive calcium score is really telling us that there are almost certainly other plaques around that may or may not be stabilized (calcified). If the plaque does become unstable, eroding or even rupturing, you’ve really got problems. The damaged plaque may ultimately cause the formation of a clot, which can narrow and ultimately block the lumen of the blood vessel—or worse, break free and cause a heart attack or stroke. This is why we worry more about the noncalcified plaques than the calcified ones. Normally, however, most atherosclerotic plaques are fairly undramatic. They grow silently and invisibly, gradually occluding the blood vessel until one day the obstruction, due to the plaque itself or a plaque-induced clot, becomes a problem. For example, a sedentary person may not notice that she has a partially blocked coronary artery until she goes outside to shovel snow. The sudden demands on her circulatory system can trigger ischemia (decreased blood delivery of oxygen) or infarction (tissue death from no blood flow)—or, in layman’s terms, a heart attack or a stroke. It may seem sudden, but the danger was lurking all along. — When I finally recognized my own cardiovascular risk, back in my thirties, I had no idea about how any of this complex disease process worked. Looking back, it’s clear that I had quite a few of the major and lesser risk factors already checked off. I didn’t smoke, which is perhaps the most potent environmental risk driver, and my blood pressure was normal, but I had other problems. And as my calcium score revealed, I already had a small, calcified plaque in the upper part of my left anterior descending (LAD) artery, one of the main arteries supplying my heart. There may have been other bad things happening there as well, but because I did not have a CT angiogram at this time, I had no sense of what kind of damage existed elsewhere in my coronary arteries. Anything shy of calcification is not identified by the calcium score. Clearly, Not-Thin Peter was already on the road to heart disease. My waist size was on track to hit 40 by the time I turned forty, a clear sign of my metabolic dysfunction. Underneath my belt, I was likely accumulating visceral fat. I was also insulin resistant, an enormous risk driver for cardiovascular disease. Though my blood pressure was fine, I suspect it would have deteriorated fairly rapidly as I aged, as hypertension seems rampant in my family. I probably also had high levels of uric acid, which as we saw in the previous chapter is often found in the company of high blood pressure and other signs of metabolic dysfunction. All of these contribute to another necessary (but not sufficient) condition that is required for atherosclerosis to develop, and that is inflammation. The endothelial barrier, in particular, is uniquely vulnerable to damage from inflammation. But no physician would likely have treated me for any of this. My blood panel did not signal any significant risk. My LDL-C tested at 110 to 120 mg/dL, just slightly higher than normal but not a cause for concern, particularly in a younger person. My triglycerides were on the higher side, slightly north of 150 mg/dL, but that did not set off any alarm bells either. I now know that these numbers almost certainly indicated a high concentration of atherogenic apoB particles—but no one bothered to test my apoB number, either. Back then, nearly fifteen years ago, the apoB test (simply, measuring the concentration of apoB-tagged particles) was not commonly done. Since then, evidence has piled up pointing to apoB as far more predictive of cardiovascular disease than simply LDL-C, the standard “bad cholesterol” measure. According to an analysis published in JAMA Cardiology in 2021, each standard-deviation increase in apoB raises the risk of myocardial infarction by 38 percent in patients without a history of cardiac events or a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (i.e., primary prevention). That’s a powerful correlation. Yet even now, the American Heart Association guidelines still favor LDL-C testing instead of apoB. I have all my patients tested for apoB regularly, and you should ask for the same test the next time you see your doctor. (Don’t be waved off by nonsensical arguments about “cost”: It’s about twenty to thirty dollars.) I was still in my thirties, yet I likely already had all three of the major prerequisites for heart disease: significant lipoprotein burden or apoB, LDL oxidation or modification (leading to the plaques that my calcium scan revealed), and a high level of background inflammation. None of these is enough to guarantee that someone will develop heart disease, but all three are necessary to develop it. We are fortunate that many of these conditions can be modulated or nearly eliminated—including apoB, by the way—via lifestyle changes and medications. As we’ll discuss in the final section, I take a very hard line on lowering apoB, the particle that causes all this trouble. (In short: get it as low as possible, as early as possible.) But before we go there, I want to talk about another deadly but relatively little-known lipoprotein that is likely responsible for graveyards full of sudden cardiac arrest victims, people whose conventional cholesterol panels and risk factor profiles otherwise looked fine. I don’t have this particular issue, thankfully, but a very good friend of mine does, and finding out about it in a timely manner likely saved his life\\"","completion":"The process of atherosclerosis, which leads to heart disease, is slow and complex. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) plays a crucial role in removing excess cholesterol from the artery walls. However, the functionality of HDL particles is not well understood, and simply increasing HDL cholesterol concentrations through drugs has not been shown to reduce cardiovascular risk. Atherosclerotic plaques develop silently over time and may not be easily detectable through traditional cardiovascular risk tests. Other risk factors, such as obesity, insulin resistance, and inflammation, also contribute to the development of atherosclerosis. The concentration of atherogenic particles, measured by apolipoprotein B (apoB), is a better predictor of cardiovascular disease risk than LDL cholesterol levels alone. One lesser-known lipoprotein, responsible for sudden cardiac arrest, is discussed later in the article."},{"prompt":"summarize this \\"I met Anahad O’Connor in 2012 on a junket to France, courtesy of the French-American Foundation and an award we had both won, and we immediately bonded. I think it was because we were the only two guys on the trip who skipped the pain au chocolat and spent our spare time in the gym. Also, he wrote about health and science for The New York Times, so we had plenty to talk about. Because I am a cholesterol nerd, I badgered Anahad into doing a comprehensive lipoprotein panel when we got back to the United States. He looked at me funny—Why should he do that? He was only in his early thirties, an extremely fit vegetarian with maybe 6 or 7 percent body fat. He should have been fine in the lipid department. But you never know; his father had died of an aneurysm, which may have been a sign of circulatory problems. As expected, his standard lipid numbers looked great. There was only one thing that seemed off, so I suggested that he should probably also get a calcium scan, as I had done, so we could get a better sense of the state of his arteries. That’s where things got interesting. Recall, my calcium score had come back at 6, placing me at higher risk than 75 to 90 percent of people my age. Anahad’s calcium score was 125—off the charts for someone so young and otherwise healthy. “Can this be real?” he said. It was. It turned out that the culprit was a little-known but very deadly type of particle called Lp(a) (pronounced “el-pee-little-A”). This hot mess of a lipoprotein is formed when a garden-variety LDL particle is fused with another, rarer type of protein called apolipoprotein(a), or apo(a) for short (not to be confused with apolipoprotein A or apoA, the protein that marks HDL particles). The apo(a) wraps loosely around the LDL particle, with multiple looping amino acid segments called “kringles,” so named because their structure resembles the ring-shaped Danish pastry by that name. The kringles are what make Lp(a) so dangerous: as the LDL particle passes through the bloodstream, they scoop up bits of oxidized lipid molecules and carry them along. As my lipid guru Tom Dayspring points out, this isn’t entirely bad. There is some evidence that Lp(a) may act as a sort of cleansing agent, like a streetsweeping truck that gathers up unpleasant and potentially harmful lipid junk and delivers it to the liver. But because Lp(a) is a member of the apoB particle family, it also has the potential to penetrate the endothelium and get lodged in an artery wall; because of its structure, Lp(a) may be even more likely than a normal LDL particle to get stuck, with its extra cargo of lipids gone bad. Even worse, once in there, it acts partly as a thrombotic or proclotting factor, which helps to speed the formation of arterial plaques. Often, the way Lp(a) announces itself is via a sudden, seemingly premature heart attack. This is what happened to Biggest Loser host Bob Harper, who suffered cardiac arrest at a gym in New York in 2017, at age fifty-two. Harper’s life was saved by a bystander who performed CPR until the paramedics arrived. He woke up in the hospital two days later, wondering what had hit him. Turns out, his very high level of Lp(a) was what had hit him. He had no idea that he was at risk. This is not an atypical scenario: when a patient comes to me and says their father or grandfather or aunt, or all three, died of “premature” heart disease, elevated Lp(a) is the first thing I look for. It is the most prevalent hereditary risk factor for heart disease, and its danger is amplified by the fact that it is still largely flying under the radar of Medicine 2.0, although that is beginning to change. Most people have relatively small concentrations of this particle, but some individuals can have as much as one hundred times more than others. The variation is largely genetic, and an estimated 20 to 30 percent of the US population has levels high enough that they are at increased risk; also, people of African descent tend to have higher levels of Lp(a), on average, than Caucasians. This is why, if you have a history of premature heart attacks in your family, you should definitely ask for an Lp(a) test. We test every single patient for Lp(a) during their first blood draw. Because elevated Lp(a) is largely genetic, the test need only be done once (and cardiovascular disease guidelines are beginning to advise a once-a-lifetime test for it anyway). Anahad was fortunate that he found out about his situation when he did. His calcium score meant that he had already suffered significant atherosclerotic damage due to his Lp(a). Beyond the harm it causes to coronary arteries, Lp(a) is particularly destructive to the aortic valve, one of the more important structures in the heart, by promoting the formation of tiny, bony particles in the valve leaflets, which leads to stenosis or narrowing of the aortic outlet. There was no quick fix for Anahad, or anyone else with elevated Lp(a). It does not seem to respond to behavioral interventions such as exercise and dietary changes the way that, say, LDL-C does. A class of drug called PCSK9 inhibitors, aimed at lowering apoB concentrations, does seem to be able to reduce Lp(a) levels by approximately 30 percent, but as yet there are no data suggesting that they reduce the excess events (heart attacks) attributable to that particle. Thus, the only real treatment for elevated Lp(a) right now is aggressive management of apoB overall. Though we can’t reduce Lp(a) directly, beyond what a PCSK9 inhibitor can do, we can lower the remaining apoB concentration sufficiently that we can reduce a patient’s overall risk. [*5] Because Anahad is relatively young, he also has more time to address his other risk factors. Luckily, we found the trouble before the trouble found him. \\"","completion":"The author, a cholesterol expert, tested his friend Anahad O'Connor's lipoprotein levels and found that although his standard lipid numbers looked great, his calcium score was very high at 125- a sign of atherosclerotic damage due to Lp(a).

Jahrhundert)', 'Literatur (Englisch)', 'Sachliteratur (Biologie)'], 'Als Ternate-Manuskript (englisch: „Ternate essay“) wird ein mit „Ternate, Februar, 1858“ unterzeichnetes Manuskript von Alfred Russel Wallace bezeichnet, in dem er seine Überlegungen zu den Mechanismen der Evolution darlegte, die zur Entstehung und Erhaltung von Arten führen. Das von der Insel Ternate an Charles Darwin geschickte Manuskript sollte von Darwin begutachtet und an Charles Lyell weitergeleitet werden. Die im Manuskript niedergelegten Ideen von Wallace zwangen Darwin zu einer schnellen Veröffentlichung seiner eigenen Ideen über die Selektion und die biologische Divergenz, die dem „Ursprung der Arten“ zugrunde liegen. Unter dem Titel On the Tendency of Varieties to depart indefinitely from the Original Type (deutsch: \\"Über die Neigung der Varietäten, sich unbegrenzt vom ursprünglichen Typus zu entfernen\\") wurde Wallaces Manuskript gemeinsam mit einem Auszug aus Darwins bis dahin unveröffentlichtem Manuskript \\"Natural Selection\\" und einer Zusammenfassung eines Briefes von Darwin an Asa Gray am 1. Juli 1858 vor der Londoner Linné-Gesellschaft verlesen und am 20. August 1858 in gedruckter Form veröffentlicht.', 'Werk.', 'Entstehungsgeschichte.', 'Nachdem Alfred Russel Wallace 1845 zum ersten Mal das anonym erschienene, von Robert Chambers stammende Werk \\"Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation\\" (Oktober 1844) gelesen hatte, war er davon überzeugt, dass die Transmutation der Arten – wie man damals die Evolution nannte – tatsächlich existiere. Seit dieser Zeit suchte er nach Hinweisen, welche Mechanismen für die Herausbildung der Arten verantwortlich sind.', 'Im März 1854 brach Wallace zu seiner zweiten großen Reise auf, die ihn nach der Erkundung des Amazonasgebietes von 1848 bis 1852 diesmal zu den Inseln des Malaiischen Archipels führte und während der er bis 1862 125.660 Tiere sammelte. In der Region Sarawak auf Borneo schrieb Wallace 1854 einen Artikel, in dem er Fakten über die geografische und geologische Verbreitung der Arten anführte, die auf ein einfaches Gesetz hindeuteten, das er mit den Worten zusammenfasste. Als er im Frühjahr 1856 gezwungen war, von Singapur aus einen Umweg über Bali und Lombok zu nehmen, um sein nächstes Reiseziel, den Ort Makassar auf der Insel Sulawesi, zu erreichen, beobachtete er deutliche Unterschiede in der Tierwelt der Inseln Bali und Lombok, die nur durch eine knapp 25 Kilometer breite Meerenge voneinander getrennt waren (ein Teil der heute nach ihm benannten Wallace-Linie). Von Januar 1857 an erforschte Wallace für fast sechs Monate die Aru-Inseln. Ihm wurde klar, dass kleine, auf ein begrenztes geografisches Gebiet beschränkte Populationen an ihre jeweiligen Umweltbedingungen angepasste Merkmale entwickelten.', 'Etwa 1853 begannen Wallace und Charles Darwin miteinander zu korrespondieren. Einen vom 10. Oktober 1856 stammenden Brief, in dem Wallace auf seinen Artikel in den \\"Annals and Magazine of Natural History\\" von 1855 Bezug nahm, erhielt Darwin Ende April 1857. Darwin beantwortete ihn fast unverzüglich; er wies auf ihre übereinstimmenden Gedankengänge hin:, betonte aber gleichzeitig, dass er sich schon zwanzig Jahre mit der Thematik beschäftige, wie sich Arten und Varietäten voneinander unterscheiden: Bereits Ende 1855 hatten Edward Blyth und Charles Lyell Darwin auf den Aufsatz von Wallace hingewiesen. Ende 1857 schrieb Darwin: ', 'Ende Januar 1858 setzte Wallace von Ternate zur Insel Halmahera über, um sich in einer einfachen Palmenblatthütte in der Bucht von Dodinga von der Malaria zu kurieren. Ende Februar 1858 hatte er während eines seiner zwei- bis dreistündigen Fieberschübe die entscheidende Idee. Er erinnerte sich an seine Lektüre von \\"Essay on the Principle of Population\\" (1798) von Thomas Robert Malthus und dessen Prinzip des „struggle for existence“ (Kampf ums Dasein), mit dem Malthus erklärte, warum es nicht zu einem übermäßigen Bevölkerungswachstum kommt.', 'Am 1. März 1858 kehrte er in sein Haus auf der Molukkeninsel Ternate zurück und schrieb innerhalb von drei Tagen seine Gedanken nieder. Anschließend verfasste er zu seinem Manuskript einen Begleitbrief an Darwin, in dem er diesen bat, seine Arbeit zu prüfen und das Manuskript dem renommierten Geologen Charles Lyell weiterzuleiten, da dieser seine früheren Artikel wohlwollend aufgenommen hatte. Er hoffe, dass für Darwin die darin entwickelten Ideen genauso neu seien wie für ihn und diese den fehlenden Faktor liefern würden, um den Ursprung der Arten zu erklären. Ein holländischer Postdampfer, der am 9. März in Ternate ablegte, beförderte das Päckchen mit dem Brief und dem Manuskript über Batavia nach Singapur. Dort übernahm es ein britischer Dampfer der P&amp;O-Linie mit dem Ziel Sues. In Ägypten wurde es auf dem Landweg bis nach Alexandria transportiert und über das Mittelmeer mit einem weiteren Dampfer der P&amp;O-Linie nach Marseille verschifft. Über Paris und Rotterdam erreichte das Päckchen zwischen Mitte Mai und Mitte Juni 1858 schließlich Darwin in Downe bei London.', 'Veröffentlichung.', 'Der Zeitpunkt, zu dem Darwin den Brief und das Ternate-Manuskript erhalten hat, lässt sich nicht mehr genau rekonstruieren, da sowohl der Brief als auch das Original-Manuskript verschollen sind. Vom Inhalt des Manuskriptes überrascht, schrieb Darwin an Lyell: Beunruhigt darüber, dass man ihm Unredlichkeit unterstellen würde, wenn er seine Theorie jetzt veröffentlichte, schrieb Darwin eine Woche später erneut an Lyell. Er verwies darin auf seinen Brief an Asa Gray, in dem er im Herbst 1857 die Grundzüge seiner Theorie dargelegt hatte und schrieb: Außerdem verwies er darauf, dass Joseph Dalton Hooker einige Jahre zuvor sein von 1844 stammendes Manuskript gelesen habe. Hooker und Lyell beschlossen, dass eine gemeinsame Veröffentlichung des Ternate-Manuskriptes mit Auszügen aus Darwins Manuskript von 1844 und einer Zusammenfassung seines Briefes an Gray die beste Lösung darstelle. Darwin sah sich am 29. Juni 1858 nicht in der Lage, selbst etwas zur Lösung des Konfliktes beizutragen, da am Abend zuvor sein jüngster Sohn Charles Waring (1856–1858) nach einer fünftägigen Scharlach-Erkrankung gestorben war.', 'Da die Geologische Gesellschaft gegenüber theoretischen Beiträgen negativ eingestellt war und die Zoologische Gesellschaft von Richard Owen beherrscht wurde, entschieden sich Hooker und Lyell für eine Veröffentlichung bei der Linné-Gesellschaft. Bedingt durch den Tod von Robert Brown, der Mitglied des Rates der Gesellschaft war und dessen Posten neu besetzt werden musste, wurde die letzte Zusammenkunft der Linné-Gesellschaft innerhalb der Sitzungsperiode 1857/1858 vom 17. Juni 1858 auf den 1. Juli verschoben. Am Vortag des Treffens schickten Hooker und Lyell die zu verlesenden Manuskripte von Darwin und Wallace mit einem Begleitbrief an den Sekretär der Gesellschaft, John Joseph Bennett (1801–1876). Deren Eingang wurde am Folgetag, vermutlich durch den Bibliothekar Richard Kippist (1812–1882), registriert.', 'In Abwesenheit von Wallace und Darwin wurde am 1. Juli 1858 das Ternate-Manuskript von Wallace gemeinsam mit einem Auszug aus Darwins unveröffentlichtem Manuskript \\"Natural Selection\\" und einer Zusammenfassung seines Briefes an Asa Gray vor der Londoner Linné-Gesellschaft verlesen. Am 20. August 1858 erschienen die Beiträge in den \\"Proceedings\\" der Linné-Gesellschaft.', 'Anfang Oktober 1858 bedankte sich Wallace bei Hooker für die gemeinsame Publikation seines Manuskriptes mit den Arbeiten von Darwin: ', 'Inhalt.', 'Mit dem Ternate-Manuskript stellte sich Wallace das Ziel, nachzuweisen,. Er untersuchte dazu Populationen von Wildtieren und beschrieb ihr Leben als einen „Kampf ums Dasein“ (engl. „struggle for existence“): ', 'Anschließend legte Wallace seine Gedanken über den Einfluss der Fruchtbarkeit und die Folgen einer Vermehrung im geometrischen Verhältnis auf das Populationswachstum frei lebender Tiere dar: ', 'Anschließend beschrieb er das Prinzip der natürlichen Selektion, ohne jedoch diesen Begriff zu verwenden: ', 'Er gelangte zu dem Schluss, dass das Überleben der begünstigten Individuen durch Anpassung an ihre Lebensbedingungen erfolgt: ', 'Wallace wandte sich anschließend der biologischen Variabilität von Tierpopulationen zu: ', 'Resümierend stellte er fest: ', 'Anschließend erklärte er: ', 'Im weiteren Verlauf des Artikels kritisierte er Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck und dessen These von der Weitergabe erworbener Fähigkeiten und griff dabei Lamarcks Beispiel der Giraffe auf: ', 'Sein gesamtes Prinzip verglich Wallace abschließend mit dem Fliehkraftregler einer Dampfmaschine: ', 'Rezeption.', 'Die Reaktionen auf den Vortrag vor der Linné-Gesellschaft waren verhalten. Ihr Präsident, der Zoologe Thomas Bell, schrieb in seinem im Mai 1859 veröffentlichten Bericht über das zurückliegende Jahr: In der Zeitschrift \\"The Zoologist\\" wurde der Artikel aus den \\"Proceedings\\" der Linné-Gesellschaft nachgedruckt und rezensiert. Darwin würdigte 1861 in seiner für die dritte Auflage neu geschriebenen historischen Einleitung zu \\"Die Entstehung der Arten\\" den Beitrag von Wallace zu seiner Theorie.', 'Erst in den 1960er Jahren setzten sich Wissenschaftshistoriker wieder intensiver mit dem Wirken von Wallace auseinander. Barbara Beddall wies 1968 erstmals auf das Fehlen einiger Dokumente aus dem Jahr 1858 hin und auch Lewis McKinney publizierte 1972 über diesen Umstand. Arnold Brackman prägte 1980 für die 1858 getroffene Übereinkunft den Ausdruck „delikate Absprache“.', 'John Brooks bezweifelte das häufig genannte Eingangsdatum 18. Juni 1858 für das Ternate-Manuskript. Er rekonstruierte die Beförderungsroute des Päckchens von Wallace, konnte jedoch den genauen Zeitpunkt der Ankunft des Päckchens nicht nachweisen, hielt aber den 18. Mai 1858 für wahrscheinlicher. Bei seiner Untersuchung des in der University Library in Cambridge aufbewahrten Manuskriptes von Darwins \\"Natural Selection\\", das dieser 1856 begonnen hatte, entdeckte Brooks einen insgesamt 41 Seiten langen Einschub, der auf andersfarbigem Papier geschrieben war und von dem er annahm, dass Darwin ihn erst nach dem Erhalt des Ternate-Manuskriptes geschrieben habe.', 'Die meisten Historiker halten Brooks Plagiatsvorwurf für unbegründet. Peter Bowler, Malcolm Kottler und Barbara Beddall verwiesen auf Parallelen im Lebenslauf von Wallace und Darwin. Beide erlebten die Artenvielfalt auf ihren Forschungsreisen. Beide lasen Malthus’ \\"Essay on the Principle of Population\\" und Lyells \\"Principles of Geology\\". Aus dieser Lektüre und ihren eigenen Beobachtungen zogen beide unabhängig voneinander ähnliche Schlüsse über die Wirkungsweise der Evolution.', 'In seiner vergleichenden Analyse stellte Ulrich Kutschera 2003 sechs bedeutende Unters: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"1.

Februar 1904 als \\"Elisabeth Grün\\" in Wien, Österreich-Ungarn; ermordet 1. Juni 1942 im Vernichtungslager Maly Trostinez) war eine österreichische Schriftstellerin und Schauspielerin. Ihr Romandebüt \\"Herz über Bord\\" (1933) wurde von der Kritik begeistert aufgenommen. Darin verarbeitet sie ihre Erfahrungen im Berliner Kabarett \\"Die Brücke\\". Grün verfasste zwei weitere Romane, bei denen es sich ebenfalls um Zeitromane der Neuen Sachlichkeit handelt. Sie veröffentlichte darüber hinaus Gedichte und kurze Geschichten in Zeitungen und Zeitschriften. Ihre autobiografisch geprägten Texte handeln von der Einsamkeit der weiblichen Hauptfiguren, der Liebe und dem Spannungsverhältnis zwischen den Geschlechtern und von der Schwierigkeit junger emanzipierter Frauen, einen Platz in der Gesellschaft zu finden. Grüns literarisches Schaffen fand durch die Entrechtung und Verfolgung der Juden in der Zeit des Nationalsozialismus ein jähes Ende. Im Jahr 2007 stieß die Germanistin Anke Heimberg auf den Roman \\"Herz über Bord\\" und begann, Nachforschungen zu Leben und Werk der Schriftstellerin anzustellen, deren Texte sie in den folgenden Jahren im Berliner AvivA Verlag herausgab.', '__INHALTSVERZEICHNIS__', 'Leben.', 'Kindheit, Jugend, Ausbildung.', 'Lili Grün war das jüngste Kind des aus Élesd stammenden ungarischen Kaufmannes Ármin Grün und seiner Frau Regina Grün, geb. Goldstein. Ihre drei Geschwister waren Frieda (1890), Karl (1894) und Grete (1896). Die Familie wohnte ab 1909 in der Arnsteingasse 33 in Reindorf, einem Teil des heutigen 15. Wiener Gemeindebezirks Rudolfsheim-Fünfhaus. Der Vater war Schnurrbartbinden-Fabrikant und vertrieb Parfümerie- und Friseurbedarfsartikel in einem Ladengeschäft im Erdgeschoss des Wohnhauses.', 'Anfang August 1915 starb Regina Grün mit 47 Jahren überraschend an einem Hirnschlag, was für die elfjährige Lili wohl „das Ende ihrer bis dahin sehr behüteten Kindheit“ bedeutete. Im Januar 1922 erlag der Vater mit 56 Jahren einem chronischen Nierenleiden. Damit wurde Grün noch vor ihrem 18. Geburtstag zur Vollwaise. Wer die Vormundschaft übernahm, ist unbekannt. Nach dem Abschluss der Volks- und Bürgerschule im Jahr 1918 absolvierte sie eine Ausbildung zur Kontoristin.', 'Im Sommer 1921 gab Grün auf dem Wiener Meldezettel „Theaterelevin“ als Beruf an, was darauf hindeutet, dass sie privaten Schauspielunterricht nahm. Von 1920 bis 1924 stand sie in allen 60 Aufführungen von Henrik Ibsens Drama \\"Peer Gynt\\" in der Rolle des Troll auf der Bühne des Deutschen Volkstheaters. Seit den 1920er Jahren wirkte sie darüber hinaus an der neu gegründeten Bühne der Sozialistischen Arbeiterjugend mit. Eine erste Hauptrolle spielte sie vermutlich an einem Theater in der Provinz.', 'Lili Grüns Bruder Karl hatte in Wien ein Studium in Jura und Philosophie begonnen, wurde eingezogen und im Krieg schwer verwundet. Danach konnte er sein Studium nicht beenden und schlug sich als Privatlehrer durch. Am 25. März 1923 wurde er wegen versuchter Geldfälschung verhaftet. Die Schwester Grete heiratete im Juli 1926 Hellmuth Bettauer, den Sohn des Schriftstellers Hugo Bettauer, der sich öffentlich für Sexualaufklärung, Straffreiheit für Homosexualität und Emanzipation der Frau einsetzte und 1925 an den Folgen eines Attentats starb. Hellmuth zog mit Grete zu Lili Grün in die Arnsteingasse und setzte das Engagement des Vaters fort. Grüns Kontakt mit Hugo Bettauer und ihre Jugend im Roten Wien prägten ihr späteres literarisches Schaffen.', 'Berliner Jahre.', 'Ende der 1920er Jahre herrschte in Wien eine hohe Arbeitslosigkeit unter Theaterschaffenden. Da unter diesen Voraussetzungen die Chancen, eine Anstellung als Schauspielerin zu finden, gering waren, verließ Grün ihre Heimatstadt und zog nach Berlin. Dort waren jedoch die Arbeitsmöglichkeiten nicht besser. Erich Kästner konstatierte im April 1929: „Man wird ohne Übertreibung annehmen dürfen, daß es in einer Stadt wie Berlin bedeutend mehr engagementslose Schauspieler gibt als solche mit Engagement“. Viele Künstler lebten unter prekären Bedingungen; die Situation der Schauspieler war „durch mangelhafte Ernährung, armselige Kleidung, äußerst bescheidene Wohnverhältnisse sowie durch Krankheit […] gekennzeichnet“ (Anke Heimberg).', 'Grün arbeitete als Verkäuferin und Küchenhilfe in einer Café-Konditorei und gründete im Frühjahr 1931 mit Gleichgesinnten das politisch-literarische Kabarett-Kollektiv \\"Die Brücke\\". Im Mai feierte man im Keller des Künstlerhauses des \\"Vereins Berliner Künstler\\" in der Bellevuestraße 3 mit einem eigenen Abendprogramm Premiere.

Welche Texte sie in den Vorstellungen der \\"Brücke\\" vortrug, ist nicht bekannt. Gesichert ist, dass ihre Auftritte auf positive Resonanz stießen: „Lily Grün bringt reizende freche Gedichte“, notierte \\"Das 12 Uhr Blatt\\" vom 5. Mai 1931 und die \\"Vossische Zeitung\\" vom 7. Mai 1931 kennzeichnete Grüns Texte als „witzig-sentimentale Gedichte“. Der Berliner \\"Film-Kurier\\" schrieb über einen Auftritt: „… trägt Erotik, sehr persönlich und sehr belustigend.“', 'Nach wenigen Wochen musste das Kabarett schließen, weil die Zuschauerzahlen abnahmen.

Mai 1931. Möglicherweise trug die im Vergleich zur \\"Katakombe\\" politisch radikalere Ausrichtung zum Publikumsrückgang bei.

Wiener Gemeindebezirk angegeben. Im Mai 1932 wurde sie bei einem Talentwettbewerb des Kabaretts \\"Simpl\\", an dem 50 Nachwuchskünstler teilnahmen, von einer Jury unter der Leitung von Hans Nüchtern als Zweitbeste ausgezeichnet. Für die Kritik war Lili Grün „eine Art weiblicher Joachim Ringelnatz“.', 'In Wien verarbeitete sie ihre Erlebnisse rund um \\"Die Brücke\\" in dem Roman \\"Herz über Bord\\". Er erschien im März 1933 beim Paul Zsolnay Verlag und wurde zum Beispiel im \\"Neuen Wiener Tagblatt\\" als „ein sehr beachtenswerter Beitrag zur Zeitgeschichte der jungen Generation“ gewürdigt. Im selben Jahr wurde Grün für den Julius-Reich-Dichter-Preis vorgeschlagen.', 'Für eine Erzählung mit dem Titel \\"Anni hat Unrecht\\" fand Grün im Anschluss keine Möglichkeit der Publikation, konnte aber beim Zsolnay Verlag eine Vorschusszahlung auf ein Exposé zum Roman \\"Loni in der Kleinstadt\\" erreichen. Im Oktober 1933 verließ sie Wien wieder. Anke Heimberg erklärt den Wegzug mit der sich wandelnden politischen Situation in Österreich. Die Regierung in Wien sah zunehmend das faschistische Italien als Vorbild an. Mit ihrem Lebensgefährten Ernst Spitz reiste Grün über Prag (1933/1934) nach Paris (1934/1935).', 'In der französischen Hauptstadt verschlechterte sich ihre gesundheitliche und wirtschaftliche Situation. Die Vorschusszahlung war bald aufgebraucht; die Tantiemen von \\"Herz über Bord\\" reichten nicht aus. Im November 1934 verkaufte sie den geschützten Titel ihres Debütromans an den Berliner Allegro Theaterverlag, damit dieser eine Operette von Eduard Künneke „Herz über Bord“ nennen konnte. Das Geld konnte Grüns Notlage nicht lindern: Es erreichte sie erst im Juni 1935, als sie wieder in Wien lebte, wohin sie Anfang 1935 schwerkrank zurückgekehrt war und offenbar erneut die Wohnung in der Marktgasse 45 bezogen hatte.', 'Der Zsolnay Verlag führte eine Spendenaktion durch, um ihr im Frühjahr 1935 einen mehrwöchigen Kuraufenthalt in Meran zu finanzieren.

Das Hauptziel war laut Scott, „den Südpol [erstmals] zu erreichen und für das British Empire die Ehre dieser Errungenschaft zu sichern“. Außerdem sollten wissenschaftliche Forschungen und Erkundungen entlang der Küste und im Inneren des antarktischen Festlands durchgeführt werden, darunter die Erforschung von Viktorialand und des Transantarktischen Gebirges. Der bekanntere Name leitet sich von der \\"Terra Nova\\" ab, dem Schiff, das die Expeditionsgruppe transportierte und die Versorgung der Expedition garantierte.', 'Der Auftritt von Roald Amundsens Fram-Expedition veränderte den Charakter der Forschungsreise und führte zu einem Wettrennen um das erstmalige Erreichen des Südpols und um das damit verbundene (nationale) Prestige. Bei seinem Vorstoß zum Südpol leitete Scott eine Fünf-Mann-Gruppe, die den Pol am 18. Januar 1912 erreichte – etwas mehr als einen Monat nach Amundsen. Auf der Rückreise fanden Scott und seine Gefährten den Tod. Der Erfolg Amundsens wurde in der Folge durch dieses Schicksal überschattet. Ein Suchtrupp fand ihre Leichen im November 1912. Den bei ihnen gefundenen Aufzeichnungen, insbesondere dem von Scott geführten Tagebuch, wurde sehr viel Aufmerksamkeit zuteil, da diese Unterlagen ihre Reise und insbesondere die Umstände ihres Scheiterns sehr ausführlich dokumentierten.', 'Vorbereitungen.', 'Hintergrund.', 'Scotts Discovery-Expedition hatte zwar entscheidend zu den wissenschaftlichen Kenntnissen über die Antarktis beigetragen, was die Polarforschung anging, war sie dagegen wesentlich weniger erfolgreich gewesen – sie war nicht weiter nach Süden gelangt als bis auf 82° 17′ S. Scott sah die Expedition als eine Art unvollendete Aufgabe, was sich in seiner Überzeugung reflektierte, der McMurdo-Sund, die ehemalige Basis der \\"Discovery\\", sei sein persönliches Arbeitsumfeld, in das er und nur er zurückkehren müsse. Scott nahm seine Marinekarriere 1906 zwar wieder auf, hegte aber noch immer den Wunsch, in die Antarktis zurückzukehren – die „Eroberung“ des Pols war hier sein erstes Ziel. Das auslösende Ereignis, das ihn seine Ambitionen in die Tat umsetzten ließ, war Ernest Shackletons Nimrod-Expedition von 1907 bis 1909, die nur knapp vor dem Südpol umkehren musste. Shackleton hatte die Route von Scotts \\"Discovery\\"-Basis über den Beardmore-Gletscher aufs Polarplateau und zum Südpol etabliert und war bei 88° 23′ S umgekehrt, weniger als 180 Kilometer vor dem Ziel. Der Gebrauch von Scotts Station entgegen anders lautenden Versprechungen hatte die Beziehung zwischen beiden getrübt und erhöhte Scotts Entschlossenheit, Shackletons Errungenschaft zu übertreffen.', 'Als er seine Vorbereitungen traf, hatte Scott keinen Grund zur Annahme, seine Polarreise würde zu einem Wettrennen ausarten. Eine gleichzeitige australische Antarktisexpedition unter Douglas Mawson würde in einem anderen Gebiet arbeiten, und Roald Amundsen, ein potenzieller Rivale, hatte Pläne für eine Arktisexpedition bekanntgegeben.', 'Frühere Expeditionen mit Einfluss auf die Terra-Nova-Expedition.', \\"Die Terra-Nova-Expedition war nur eine von zahlreichen Unternehmungen im Rossmeergebiet zwischen 1840 und 1910. Diese Expeditionen strebten eine Mischung aus Entdeckungsfahrten und wissenschaftlichen und kommerziellen Aktivitäten an. Der Südliche Ozean rund um die Antarktis wurde im späten 19. Jahrhundert dank des Walfangs zu einem Gebiet von wachsender kommerzieller Bedeutung. Privatpersonen und Regierungen finanzierten Expeditionen mit der Absicht, Basen in der Antarktis einzurichten. Man wollte die Wal- und Robbenpopulationen ausbeuten und das Potenzial an Bodenschätzen untersuchen. Mit der Jahrhundertwende begann sich die öffentliche Aufmerksamkeit auf den Südpol zu fokussieren. Fridtjof Nansens fehlgeschlagener Versuch von 1895 zur Erreichung des Nordpols und Robert Edwin Pearys anscheinend erfolgreicher Versuch 1909 (heute umstritten) ließen den Südpol als 'letzte geografische Herausforderung' übrig. Das Rossmeer, der südlichste Punkt der Antarktis, wo man mit einem Schiff anlanden kann, war der Idealort für die Lancierung eines dahingehenden Versuches.\\", 'Trotz der bestehenden Tradition, dass Staaten nur die Gebiete erforschten, die sie entdeckt hatten, hatten sowohl Norwegen als auch Großbritannien eine Forschungsvorgeschichte im Rossmeer. Aufgeführt sind frühere Expeditionen sowie die Expeditionen im Wettlauf um den Südpol.', 'Mitglieder der Expedition.', 'Von den 65 Männern, welche die einzelnen Gruppen und die Mannschaft des Schiffs stellten und die aus 8000 Bewerbern ausgewählt wurden, waren sechs Veteranen der \\"Discovery\\"-Expedition, fünf waren mit Shackleton auf der \\"Nimrod\\" gewesen. Leutnant Edward „Teddy“ Evans war während der Operation zur Evakuierung der \\"Discovery\\" Navigationsoffizier der \\"Morning\\" gewesen und wurde zu Scotts Stellvertreter ernannt. Seine Pläne zur Organisation einer eigenen Expedition hatte er aufgegeben und die finanzielle Rückendeckung an die Terra-Nova-Expedition abgetreten.', 'Obwohl die Expedition privat organisiert war, genoss sie breite Unterstützung durch die britische Regierung; so zeigte sich die Admiralität sehr großzügig, als es darum ging, Scott mit Offizieren und Seeleuten zu versorgen. Unter dem angeworbenen Marinepersonal waren neben Scott selbst und Teddy Evans Leutnant Harry Pennell, der nach der Landung der Küstengruppen das Kommando über das Schiff übernehmen sollte, und zwei Schiffsärzte im Rang von Leutnants, George Murray Levick und Edward Atkinson. Durch die Umstände übernahm Atkinson im Jahr 1912 zeitweilig während einer schwierigen Periode das Kommando über die Küstengruppe. Der ehemalige Royal-Navy-Offizier Victor Campbell war eines der wenigen Mannschaftsmitglieder, die Ski fahren konnten, und sollte die Nordgruppe leiten. Zu Scotts Zufriedenheit sorgte die Admiralität dafür, dass sein seemännischer Unterbau praktisch völlig aus der Navy kam, darunter auch die Antarktisveteranen Edgar Evans, Tom Crean und William Lashly.', 'Es wurden auch zwei nicht aus der Royal Navy stammende Offiziere angeheuert: Henry Robertson Bowers, bekannt als „Birdie“, ein Leutnant der \\"Royal Indian Marine\\", und Lawrence „Titus“ Oates, ein Armeehauptmann von den \\"Royal Iniskilling Dragoons\\". Oates, selbst wohlhabend, unterstützte die Expedition zusätzlich mit 1000 Britischen Pfund.', 'Dem Rat Fridtjof Nansens folgend warb Scott einen jungen norwegischen Skiexperten an, Tryggve Gran. Im Zuge seiner geplanten gemischten Transportstrategie ernannte er Cecil Meares zum Verantwortlichen für die Hundeteams und rekrutierte Shackletons früheren Motorenspezialisten, Bernard Day, der die Motorschlitten in Gang halten sollte. Oates sollte sich um die Pferde kümmern, obwohl Scott unerklärlicherweise Meares (der nichts von Pferden verstand) beauftragte, diese zu kaufen, was unglückliche Auswirkungen auf ihre Qualität hatte.', 'Um sein wissenschaftliches Programm durchzuführen, wählte Scott erfahrenere Mitarbeiter als die, die auf der \\"Discovery\\" gedient hatten. Der Chefwissenschaftler und Zoologe war Edward Adrian Wilson, der Scott unter den Männern am nächsten stand und der sich auf der Discovery-Expedition nicht nur als Wissenschaftler, sondern auch als glänzender Illustrator und kühner Polarforscher erwiesen hatte. Sein wissenschaftlicher Stab schloss einige Forscher ein, die später große Karrieren durchliefen: George Clarke Simpson, der Meteorologe, Charles Wright, der kanadische Physiker, und die Geologen Frank Debenham und Raymond Priestley. T. Griffith Taylor, der Chef der Geologen, und der Biologe Edward Nelson komplettierten neben dem überraschend angeheuerten Assistenzzoologen Apsley Cherry-Garrard das Team. Cherry-Garrard hatte keine wissenschaftliche Erfahrung, doch er war ein Schützling Wilsons. Er steuerte wie Oates 1000 Pfund zur Finanzierung der Expedition bei. Cherry-Garrard erwies sich nicht nur als ausdauernd, sondern auch als sorgsamer Chronist. Herbert Ponting, der Fotograf, hinterließ lebendige visuelle Aufzeichnungen.', 'Finanzierung.', 'Im Gegensatz zur Discovery-Expedition, die von der Royal Society und der Royal Geographical Society bezahlt worden war, wurde die Terra-Nova-Expedition als Privatunternehmen finanziert. Die Hälfte der geschätzten Gesamtkosten von 40.000 Britischen Pfund wurde von der Regierung aufgebracht, der Rest durch Spenden aus der Öffentlichkeit und Kredite. Auch waren viele Firmen bereit, kostenlos Vorräte und Ausrüstungsgegenstände zur Verfügung zu stellen. Die Aufgabe der Geldbeschaffung wurde hauptsächlich von Scott bewältigt und kostete ihn einen wesentlichen Anteil seiner Zeit und Energie, auch da sie nach der Abreise der \\"Terra Nova\\" aus Großbritannien auch in Südafrika, Australien und Neuseeland noch weitergeführt wurde.', 'Der bei weitem größte Kostenpunkt waren die Anschaffung der \\"Terra Nova\\" für 12.500 Britische Pfund sowie deren Überholung. Die \\"Terra Nova\\" hatte zuvor bereits im Zuge der zweiten Operation zum Entsatz der \\"Discovery\\" antarktische Gewässer befahren. Scott wollte sie als Marineschiff unter dem White Ensign segeln lassen; um dies zu sichern, trat er der Royal Yacht Squadron bei. So konnte er auf der Expedition die Disziplin der Marine ausnutzen, außerdem unterlag die \\"Terra Nova\\" als registrierte Yacht der Royal Yacht Squadron nicht mehr den Regulationen des Board of Trade, die sie sonst möglicherweise als hochseeuntauglich eingestuft hätten.', 'Genereller Plan für die Expedition.', 'Die Expedition sollte während dreier antarktischer Saisons ablaufen, der Plan sah aus wie folgt:', 'Die \\"Terra Nova\\" sollte nicht in der Antarktis überwintern. Nach dem Abladen von Männern, Gütern und Ausrüstung und dem Transport der Forschungsgruppen zu ihren Einsatzgebieten sollte sie nach Neuseeland zurückkehren. Im Januar/Februar 1912 sollte sie dann mit frischen Männern und Vorräten zurückkehren, bevor sie im Januar 1913 die Expedition wieder nach Hause bringen sollte.', 'Zur Umsetzung dieses Plans setzte Scott auf eine aus mehreren Fortbewegungsmitteln bestehende Transportstrategie. Fridtjof Nansen hatte ihm Schlittenhunde empfohlen. Ponys waren von Shackleton auf der Nimrod-Expedition (1907–1909) erstmals in der Antarktis erfolgreich eingesetzt worden, wohingegen das von Shackleton gleichfalls verwendete Auto fehlschlug. Scott nahm daher Hunde und Ponys mit auf die Reise. Als technische Neuerung sollten erstmals Kettenfahrzeuge („Motors“) zum Ziehen der Schlitten in der Antarktis eingesetzt werden. Scott plante, den Großteil des Proviants und Brennstoffs mit Hilfe der Ponys, Hunde und Motoren über das Schelfeis bis zum Fuße des Beardmore-Gletschers zu transportieren, dann auf dem Gletscher und nachfolgend auf dem Plateau leichte Trans: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"1.

Gelegentlich werden ebenfalls die Offiziere des kaiserlichen Militärs mit diesem Begriff bezeichnet.', 'Mandarine waren Gelehrte, Richter und Beamte, die ihren Dienst in allen Bereichen der chinesischen Verwaltung versahen. Ihr Amt und die damit verbundenen Titel und Ränge wurden ihnen nach einer jahrelangen, elitären Ausbildung verliehen. Dabei waren sie einem rigorosen Auswahl- und Prüfungssystem unterworfen, das garantieren sollte, dass die Verwaltung des Landes nur durch die gelehrtesten und fähigsten Köpfe wahrgenommen wurde. Die Amtsausübung und -befähigung eines jeden Mandarins wurde regelmäßig streng kontrolliert. Im untersten Rang waren sie als Lehrer an Schulen tätig, in den höchsten Rängen waren sie einflussreiche wie vielrespektierte Verwalter, Berater und Gelehrte, aber auch Herolde und Diplomaten im Namen und Auftrag des Kaisers. Wichtigste Verwaltungszentren waren die Hauptstadt Peking () und Nanking (), das als Ersatzhauptstadt vorgesehen war. Mandarine sind bis heute für ihre seidenen, prachtvollen Hoftrachten bekannt, die mit Wappentieren bestickt und in streng vorgegebenen Farben geschmückt waren und so den Rang und die Stellung bei Hofe aufzeigten. Das traditionelle Patriarchat prägte sowohl das Amtswesen als auch das Familienleben; Frauen war nicht gestattet, das Amt eines Mandarins auszuüben. Die Macht und der Einfluss der Mandarine sowie ihr striktes und strenges Verwaltungssystem bildeten das Rückgrat des chinesischen Imperiums, das mit dieser Institution für mehr als fünf Jahrhunderte wuchs und gedieh.', 'Etymologie.', 'Das Wort \\"Mandarin\\" stammt wahrscheinlich über die Vermittlung des Portugiesischen vom malaiischen Wort \\"mantari\\" ‚Berater, Verwalter, Minister‘, das seinerseits von gleichbedeutend hindust. \\"mantrī\\" () &lt; Sanskrit \\"mantrín-\\" entlehnt ist und in Süd- und Südostasien als Titel für Staatsdiener und Würdenträger weit verbreitet war, nicht jedoch in China. Erst die portugiesischen Seefahrer des 16. Jahrhunderts, die zunächst Indien und Malaya, dann China erreichten, übertrugen das Wort auf die chinesische Verwaltung. Der Lautwandel von \\"t\\" zu \\"d\\" erfolgte vermutlich durch Anlehnung an das portugiesische Wort \\"mandar\\" ‚befehlen‘. In der Form \\"mandarim\\", später \\"mandarin\\", niederländisch auch \\"mandarijn\\", \\"mandorijn\\", fand das Wort Eingang in die europäischen Sprachen. Das Oxford English Dictionary (OED) datiert die Erstverwendung im Portugiesischen auf das Jahr 1514, der Hobson-Jobson auf das Jahr 1522.', 'In China selbst war zu dieser Zeit üblich, Beamte bei Hofe mit \\"lǎoye\\" (; zu dt. etwa ‚werter Herr‘) anzusprechen, als generelle Bezeichnung für einen Beamten fand das Wort \\"guān\\" () Verwendung. Der Gebrauch des Begriffs \\"guān\\" – im feudalen China entspricht etwa dem westlichen Begriff Mandarin.', 'Geschichte.', 'Eine Auswahl der Beamten durch Prüfungen war in China eine Tradition, die bereits auf die Han-Dynastie (206 v. Chr. – 220 n. Chr.) zurückgeht, aber erst während der Ming-Dynastie (1368–1644) erreichte diese Praxis ihre höchste Blüte. Kaiser Hóngwǔ begann seine Herrschaft mit weitreichenden Säuberungen, denen Zehntausende, darunter Adlige und hochrangige Beamte, zum Opfer fielen. Im Jahr 1380 reorganisierte er die Zentralverwaltung des Reiches. Die zuvor existierenden Einrichtungen wurden entmachtet, das Hauptbüro wurde aufgelöst, es blieben sechs Ministerien mit jeweils untereinander gleichberechtigten Ministern an der Spitze, die direkt dem Kaiser unterstellt waren. Die vorherige zentrale Militärkommission wurde ebenfalls aufgelöst und in fünf Einheiten unterteilt; jede war selbständig, ihre Kommandanten untereinander gleichberechtigt.', 'Die zur Zeit der Machtübernahme durch Hóngwǔ vorhandenen ca. 5000 Beamtenstellen wurden zunächst auf Empfehlung der regionalen Adligen besetzt, deren Länder in das Reich integriert worden waren. Soweit möglich wurden die Empfohlenen für eine Befragung in die Hauptstadt beordert und ihnen anschließend ein Posten in der Zentral- oder auch Provinzialverwaltung zugewiesen. Ab dem Jahr 1368 wurden Agenten in die Provinzen des Landes entsandt, um geeignete Kandidaten ausfindig zu machen. Durch kaiserliche Erlasse wurde dazu aufgefordert, „intelligente und aufrichtige“, „würdige und ehrliche“, „treue und unbestechliche“ Personen für einen Beamtenposten vorzuschlagen. Selbst als das Prüfungssystem in der ersten Hälfte des 15. Jahrhunderts bereits etabliert war, wurden vereinzelt Beamte auf Empfehlung Adliger oder hochrangiger Würdenträger in ihr Amt bestellt. Vollständig zum Erliegen kam diese Praxis erst nach 1440.', 'Nach 1440 war die Absolvierung der Auswahlprüfungen der einzige Weg, der eine Laufbahn bis in die höchsten Beamtenposten ermöglichte. Die ersten Auswahlprüfungen der Ming-Dynastie begannen zwischen 1368 und 1371 und brachten 120 hauptstädtische Absolventen im Jahr 1371 hervor. Zunächst wurde das Prüfungssystem wieder aufgegeben, da der Kaiser die Absolventen letztlich nur als „Phrasendrescher“ empfand. In den Jahren 1384/85 fanden erneut Prüfungen statt, und von da an bis zum Ende der Dynastie insgesamt 90-mal. Fast 25.000 Kandidaten schlossen während der Dynastie erfolgreich die letzte und anspruchsvollste Prüfung in der Hauptstadt ab. Eine Quote, wie viele Prüflinge das abschließende Examen in der Hauptstadt bestehen konnten, war nicht vorgegeben. Die Zahl der erfolgreichen Abschlüsse schwankte im Lauf der Zeit zwischen 32 und 472, durchschnittlich absolvierten alle drei Jahre 276 Kandidaten die Prüfung erfolgreich. Die Prüfungen auf Provinzebene bestanden in der Zeit der Ming-Dynastie ca. 100.000, sodass für die am Ende der Ming-Dynastie 25.000 vorhandenen Posten in der Zivilverwaltung gerade eine ausreichende Anzahl geeigneter Personen vorhanden war.', 'Während der Qing-Dynastie veränderte sich das Prüfungssystem nur unwesentlich (siehe hierzu: Chinesische Beamtenprüfung während der Qing-Dynastie). Die im Dreijahresrhythmus stattfindenden hauptstädtischen Prüfungen brachten im Durchschnitt weniger Absolventen als in der vorhergehenden Dynastie hervor (239 Absolventen in jedem dritten Jahr). Da jedoch die am Ende der Ming-Dynastie aufgekommene Praxis zusätzlicher Prüfungstermine, z. B. anlässlich des kaiserlichen Geburtstags, fortgeführt wurde, erhielt eine weit größere Anzahl von Personen den formellen Status eines Absolventen der Hauptstadtprüfung. Diese Absolventen, die (), besetzten nach und nach alle der ca. 25.000 Stellen der Zivilverwaltung. Nach 1660 war es für jemanden, der nur die Prüfung auf Provinzebene bestanden hatte, nahezu unmöglich geworden, in einen offiziellen Beamtenrang aufzusteigen.', 'Zunehmender gesellschaftlicher Wohlstand ließ im Verlauf die Zahl derjenigen ansteigen, die über die Voraussetzungen für eine Beamtenlaufbahn verfügten. Um das Überangebot an Kandidaten einzuschränken, reduzierte die Regierung die Quote für die Anzahl der Absolventen der alle drei Jahre auf Provinzebene stattfindenden Prüfungen und verschärfte die Prüfungsbedingungen gegen Ende des 18. Jahrhunderts. Und dennoch gab es um 1700 bei einer Bevölkerung von 200 Millionen Menschen ca. 500.000 Männer, die für die Prüfungen auf Provinzebene zugelassen waren. Ein Jahrhundert später, um 1800, nahmen an den zweijährlichen, lokalen Prüfungen jeweils 2 Millionen Kandidaten teil (bei einer Gesamtbevölkerung von 300 Millionen). Um 1900, gegen Ende der Qing-Dynastie, verfügten zwischen 1,6 und 1,9 Prozent der Gesamtbevölkerung über einen durch Prüfungen erworbenen Gelehrtenstatus, allerdings, ohne dass damit auch gleichzeitig ein Amt als Beamter verbunden war.', 'Aufgegeben wurde das System der Beamtenprüfung schließlich im Jahr 1905, wenige Jahre vor dem Ende des Kaiserreichs und der Gründung der Republik.', 'Ämter.', 'Verwaltungsstruktur Chinas.', 'Die Verwaltung Chinas zur Kaiserzeit setzte sich aus drei Bereichen zusammen: dem Militär, gegliedert in fünf Hauptabteilungen bzw. Militärkommissionen, der allgemeinen Zivilverwaltung, gegliedert in sechs Ministerien, und der Zensurbehörde. Jeder dieser Bestandteile hatte drei Ebenen: eine obere auf Hauptstadtebene, eine mittlere auf der Ebene der Provinzen und eine untere auf der Ebene der Präfekturen und Landkreise. Über allem stand der Kaiser als Letztverantwortlicher. Einen Ministerrat und einen Premierminister gab es seit der Machtübernahme Hóngwǔs nicht mehr. An deren Stelle hatte dieser im Jahr 1382 die Einrichtung der „Großsekretäre“ geschaffen: Gelehrte aus der Hanlin-Akademie, die als persönliche Berater des Kaisers fungierten und von denen jeder einen eigenen, vom Kaiser zugewiesenen Verantwortungsbereich hatte. Nominell gab es sechs dieser „Großsekretäre“, deren Stellen im Lauf der Zeit nicht immer alle besetzt waren, selten waren es aber gleichzeitig weniger als drei. Ab 1424 erhielten die „Großsekretäre“ eine Ernennung als höchstrangige Beamte und den zugehörigen Ehrentitel (Rang 1 a und 1 b). Sie hatten Vorrang vor allen anderen Beamten der Zivilverwaltung. Gleichzeitig behielten sie ihre Ämter und Rangbezeichnungen, die sie an der Hanlin-Akademie innehatten. Sie waren die einzigen Beamten, die gleichzeitig zwei Ämter bekleideten.', 'Die sechs Ministerien (Personal, Finanzen, Riten, Krieg, Justiz und öffentliche Arbeiten) wurden jeweils von einem Minister (bis 1380 Rang 3 a, danach Rang 2 a) und einem Vizeminister (Rang 3 a) geleitet.

Mabel: “Whoa, hey! I’ve never seen you around here before. Are you lost?” Timmy: “Nope, just sightseeing. I’m Timmy, by the way.” Mabel: “Hi, Timmy! I’m Mabel. What brings you to Gravity Falls?” Timmy: “Oh, you know, just checking out the supernatural sights. And, uh, trying to escape my babysitter, Vicky.” Mabel: (laughs) “I know the feeling. My dipper and I are always getting into trouble with our great uncle Stan. Say, want to explore the town together?” Timmy: “Sure, that sounds awesome!” As they walk and talk, Timmy finds himself drawn to Mabel’s infectious energy and carefree attitude. Meanwhile, Mabel sees Timmy’s fairy godparents and magic as a source of awe and wonder. INT. MYSTERY SHACK - LATER Mabel and Timmy enter the Mystery Shack, where they are greeted by Dipper and Stan.

I’ll even throw in a free postcard.” Timmy: “That sounds great, Mr. Pines!” During the tour, Timmy and Mabel bond over their shared love of weirdness and their respective magical powers. Timmy impresses Mabel with his fairy magic, while Mabel shows Timmy the various supernatural curiosities in the Mystery Shack. INT. GRAVITY FALLS FOREST - NIGHT As night falls, Mabel suggests they take a break from the town and go stargazing in the forest. Mabel: “The stars look amazing tonight. Want to join me for some stargazing?” Timmy: “Sure, that sounds like fun!” As they lay on a blanket, Timmy and Mabel talk and laugh under the stars. Timmy, emboldened by the romantic atmosphere, takes Mabel’s hand. Timmy: “Mabel, I know we just met, but I feel a real connection with you.” Mabel: (smiling) “Me too, Timmy.” With that, Timmy leans in and the two share a sweet, magical kiss under the stars.

The silence is broken by a rustling sound coming from the bushes. Mabel: “What was that?” Timmy: “I don’t know. Maybe it’s something supernatural?” They both stand up and approach the bushes cautiously. Suddenly, a group of gnomes jump out and surround them. Gnome #1: “Hello there! We are the Gnome Kingdom!” Gnome #2: “And we have been searching for our queen!” Timmy and Mabel share a confused look. Mabel: “Queen? I don’t think I’m the queen of anything.” Gnome #3: “But you are! You have been chosen to rule over us!” Timmy: “Chosen? By who?” Gnome #4: “By the goblin prophecy, of course!” Mabel and Timmy look at each other, still unsure of what is happening. Mabel: “I don’t know what that means, but I really don’t think I’m the queen you’re looking for.” The Gnome Kingdom looks disappointed. Gnome #1: “But we’ve been searching for so long.” Gnome #2: “Please, your highness, won’t you at least come with us to meet the council?” Mabel and Timmy share another look, then nod. Mabel: “Okay, we’ll come with you. But if this is some kind of joke, I’m going to be really upset.” The gnomes cheer and lead the way, Mabel and Timmy following hesitantly. INT.

It is a great honor to have you visit our humble kingdom, Your Majesty.” Mabel and Timmy both cringe at the title. Mabel: “I’m really sorry to disappoint you, but I don’t think I’m the queen you’re looking for.” Gnome Elder: “Nonsense! You must be the one the prophecy foretold.” Timmy: “Can you tell us more about this prophecy? Maybe there’s been a misunderstanding.” The Gnome Elder nods and begins to recount the prophecy as the others listen in awe. Mabel and Timmy exchange glances, surprised but also skeptical. Mabel: “I don’t know. This all seems pretty far-fetched.” Timmy: “Agreed. But maybe there’s more to this than meets the eye.” As they listen to the prophecy, they start to notice some similarities to their own lives.

We want to find a way to end the conflict between our kingdoms.\\" Goblin Leader: \\"Ha! You think we would just sit down and have a friendly chat with our enemies?\\" Timmy: \\"We're not your enemies.

We have a plan.\\" The Goblin Leader looks skeptical but listens as Mabel and Timmy explain their plan to unite the kingdoms and bring peace to the lands. Goblin Leader: \\"Hmm, that's an interesting proposal. But why should we trust you?\\" Mabel: \\"Because we're willing to take a risk and try something new. We know that the past doesn't have to dictate the future.\\" The Goblin Leader considers their words and finally nods. Goblin Leader: \\"Very well. We'll hear you out.

Goblin Champion: “So, you think you can defeat me in battle of the mind? We’ll see about that.” Mabel: “We’re ready.” The Goblin Champion begins to ask them riddles and puzzles, testing their intelligence and wit. Mabel and Timmy work together, each using their unique strengths and abilities to solve the challenges. As the final puzzle is presented, they both pause, unsure of the answer. Goblin Champion: “Time is running out. What’s your answer?” Mabel: “Wait. We’re not sure.” Timmy: “But we have to know.” Suddenly, Mabel remembers a lesson she learned on their journey and shares it with Timmy. Mabel: “It’s okay to ask for help.” Timmy looks at her, understanding the meaning behind her words. Timmy: “You’re right. Help us, please.” Unexpectedly, a voice from the crowd speaks up, offering the solution to the puzzle. Voice: “The answer is a mirror.” The Goblin Champion looks surprised but acknowledges the correct answer. Goblin Champion: “Very well. You have proven your worth. We will hear your proposal.” Mabel and Timmy present their plan to unite the kingdoms and end the fighting. At first, there is skepticism and resistance from some of the goblins, but eventually, they begin to see the merits of the proposal and agree to make peace. As Mabel and Timmy leave the Goblin Kingdom, they feel a sense of accomplishment and relief. Mabel: “We did it. We really did it.” Timmy: “Yeah, we did. I couldn’t have done it without you, Mabel.” Mabel: “Same here, Timmy. We make a pretty good team. Maybe it’s not just destiny. Maybe it’s also our friendship that brought us here.” Timmy smiles at her, grateful for their journey and the bond they’ve formed along the way.

Technische und kommerzielle Bedeutung erlangte es ab den 1920er-Jahren, als Thomas Midgley im Forschungslabor von General Motors seine Wirksamkeit als Antiklopfmittel für Motorenbenzin entdeckte. Die Standard Oil of New Jersey, die das Patent auf die Herstellung hatte, und General Motors, die das Anwendungspatent besaßen, gründeten daraufhin 1924 die Ethyl Corporation, die Tetraethylblei herstellte und vermarktete.', 'Tetraethylblei wirkt als Antiklopfmittel, da es die bei der Verbrennung von Kohlenwasserstoffen im Motor entstehenden Hydroperoxyl-Radikale abfängt und dadurch eine verzweigte Kettenreaktion inhibiert und so das Klopfen unterbindet. Aufgrund seines guten Preis-Wirksamkeits-Verhältnisses wurde es weltweit als Antiklopfmittel eingesetzt. Seine sekundäre Funktion bestand darin, die Abnutzung an Ventilen und Ventilsitzen in Motoren zu begrenzen.', 'Die Aufnahme von Tetraethylblei in den Körper kann durch Inhalation, über Hautresorption oder durch Verschlucken erfolgen. Es ist lipophil, giftig und bereits die Aufnahme von geringen Mengen führt zu einer schweren Bleivergiftung.

Die bei der Verbrennung von Tetraethylblei im Motor entstehenden Bleioxid- und -halogenidpartikel werden mit dem Abgas ausgestoßen und mit der Atemluft aufgenommen. Sie schädigen ebenfalls das Nervensystem, insbesondere das von Kindern. Durch die Verwendung von Tetraethylblei im Benzin wurden allein in den Vereinigten Staaten zwischen seiner Einführung und dem Verbot mehrere Millionen Tonnen Blei emittiert.', 'Nachdem es anfangs bei der Herstellung von Tetraethylblei zu Vergiftungen und Todesfällen gekommen war, verbot der Surgeon General of the United States 1925 kurzzeitig seine Produktion und Anwendung. Ab den 1970er-Jahren schränkten die Vereinigten Staaten gemäß dem Clean Air Act die Verwendung von Tetraethylblei ein. Neben dem Schutz der Gesundheit sollte damit die Vergiftung von Drei-Wege-Katalysatoren vermieden werden. In der Bundesrepublik Deutschland wurde 1976 der Bleigehalt im Benzin auf 0,15 Gramm pro Liter eingeschränkt, der Gesetzgeber verbot 1988 verbleites Normalbenzin in Deutschland.

So berichtete Carl Löwig, der 1853 die Nachfolge von Bunsen am Lehrstuhl für Chemie der Universität Breslau angetreten hatte, im selben Jahr über die Darstellung der ersten metallorganischen Alkylbleiverbindung. Für deren Darstellung verwendete er eine Blei-Natrium-Legierung, die er mit Iodethan umsetzte. Durch Extraktion mit Diethylether erhielt er eine farblose Flüssigkeit, die sich in Diethylether und Ethylacetat löste, jedoch nicht in Wasser. Löwig konnte Tetraethylblei nicht als reine Verbindung darstellen, da es sich bei der Destillation zersetzte.', 'Über die erste Darstellung von reinem Tetraethylblei berichtete schließlich George Bowdler Buckton, zur damaligen Zeit Assistent von August Wilhelm von Hofmann am Royal College of Chemistry in London. Er setzte dazu Diethylzink mit einem Überschuss von Blei(II)-chlorid um. Durch eine Destillation des Reaktionsprodukts im leichten Vakuum gelang ihm die Reindarstellung von Tetraethylblei. Buckton untersuchte ebenfalls die Reaktionen von Tetraethylblei mit Chlorwasserstoff unter Bildung von Triethylbleichlorid, mit Schwefelsäure unter Bildung von Hexaethyldibleisulfat ([(C2H5)3Pb]2SO4) und mit Kaliumhydroxid unter Bildung von Hexaethyldibleioxid ([(C2H5)3Pb]2O).

Jahrhunderts viele weitere metallorganische Alkylverbindungen, und Tetraethylblei war nur eine von vielen. Es war nicht abzusehen, dass diese Verbindung ab den 1920er-Jahren eine große technische Bedeutung zur Lösung des Klopfproblems erlangen würde. Das Phänomen des Klopfens und dessen schädigende Auswirkung auf den Motor beschrieb bereits Nicolaus Otto 1862 in den Anmerkungen zu den Arbeiten an seinem ersten Viertaktmotor, einer Vierzylinder-Versuchsmaschine:', 'Dieses Klopfen begrenzte die Steigerung des Wirkungsgrads des Ottomotors, vor allem im oberen Lastbereich. Ein klopffester Kraftstoff lässt ein höheres Verdichtungsverhältnis zu, das zu einer höheren Kraftstoffeffizienz und einer besseren Nutzleistung führt.', 'Charles Kettering, der Erfinder des elektrischen Anlassers und Gründer der \\"Dayton Engineering Laboratories Company\\" (Delco), beschäftigte sich ab etwa 1910 mit der Verbesserung des thermischen Wirkungsgrads von Verbrennungsmotoren. Er ahnte, dass dazu die Lösung des Klopfproblems von entscheidender Bedeutung wäre, und beauftragte 1916 seinen Mitarbeiter Thomas Midgley mit dessen Untersuchung. Midgley testete daraufhin die Antiklopfeigenschaften von Iod, Anilin und tausenden weiteren organischen und anorganischen Substanzen. Obwohl einige der getesteten Stoffe brauchbare Antiklopfeigenschaften zeigten, schieden sie wegen anderer unerwünschter Eigenschaften wie zu hoher Kosten oder ihrer Korrosionsneigung aus. Die metallorganischen Alkylverbindungen Diethylselenid ((C2H5)2Se) und Diethyltellurid ((C2H5)2Te) zeigten gute Antiklopfeigenschaften, doch besonders die letztere verlieh dem Abgas laut Midgley einen „satanischen Knoblauchgeruch“.', 'General Motors (GM) übernahm 1919 Ketterings Firma und funktionierte sie zur Forschungsabteilung des Automobilkonzerns um, die Kettering als Vice President führte. Zu dieser Zeit arbeitete der Chemiker Robert E. Wilson, Professor für Angewandte Chemie am Massachusetts Institute of Technology, ebenfalls an Forschungsprojekten für GM. Basierend auf den guten Antiklopfeigenschaften der Alkylmetallverbindungen lenkte er Midgleys Interesse auf eine systematische Untersuchung dieser Produktgruppe. Im Dezember 1921 fanden schließlich Tests mit Tetraethylblei statt, wobei sich gute Antiklopfeigenschaften bereits bei einer Konzentration von 0,025 % zeigten. Tetraethylblei erwies sich als 118 mal effektiver als Anilin und etwa 1200 mal effektiver als Ethanol und war allen anderen getesteten Produkten weit überlegen.', 'Basierend auf den Arbeiten von Löwig erfolgte die erste technische Synthese von Tetraethylblei auf Basis von Iodethan, die sich jedoch schnell als zu teuer erwies. DuPont entwickelte daraufhin einen Prozess auf Basis von Bromethan, der sich jedoch ebenfalls als zu teuer erwies. In der Zwischenzeit verhandelte GM mit Standard Oil of New Jersey über den Einsatz von Tetraethylblei in deren Produkten. Die von GM angebotenen Konditionen veranlassten Standard Oil, einen eigenen Prozess auf Basis von preiswertem Chlorethan zu entwickeln. Die Forschungsarbeiten dazu vergab Standard Oil an Charles August Kraus, der das industrielle Verfahren mit seinem Mitarbeiter Conrad Callis entwickelte und 1923 patentierte.', 'Da Tetraethylblei nach diesem Verfahren wesentlich günstiger herzustellen war als nach den Verfahren von GM und DuPont, gründeten Standard Oil Company of New Jersey, die das Herstellungspatent besaß, und General Motors, die das Anwendungspatent besaß, am 18. August 1924 die Ethyl Gasoline Corporation. In dieser Gesellschaft bündelten die Anteilseigner die Aktivitäten zur Herstellung, Verwendung und Vermarktung von Tetraethylblei. Die Ethyl Corporation beauftragte DuPont mit der Produktion, da weder Standard Oil noch GM Erfahrungen auf diesem Gebiet hatten.', 'Bei Testfahrten und auf Motorprüfständen zeigte sich, dass sich Tetraethylblei nicht problemlos einsetzen ließ. Das verbrannte Tetraethylblei hinterließ eine Schicht aus Blei(II)-oxid im Brennraum sowie auf den Zündkerzen. Thomas Alwin Boyd, ein Mitarbeiter Midgleys, entdeckte, dass die Zugabe von 1,2-Dibromethan diese Ablagerungen verhinderte. Durch diesen Zusatzstoff bildete sich das leichter flüchtige Blei(II)-bromid, das mit dem Abgas emittiert wurde.', 'Da Brom knapp und teuer war, entwickelte die GM-Forschungsabteilung in Zusammenarbeit mit Dow Chemical einen Prozess zur Gewinnung von Brom aus Meerwasser. Dazu wurde Chlor ins Meerwasser eingespeist, das die dort vorhandenen Bromide oxidierte und so Brom freisetzte. Anlagen in Kure Beach, North Carolina, und Freeport, Texas, lieferten das benötigte Brom für die Bromierung von Ethen. Kurioserweise geht dieses Verfahren ebenfalls auf Carl Löwig zurück, der 1825 durch Einleiten von Chlor in Bad Kreuznacher Solewasser Brom gewann.', 'Am 2. Februar 1923 verkaufte die Refiners Oil Company die ersten Liter eines mit Tetraethylblei versetzten Benzins an einen Autofahrer in Dayton (Ohio). Mittels eines sogenannten „Ethylizers“, einer Handpumpe, wurde das Tetraethylblei zum Benzin gepumpt. Bis August 1923 waren etwa 30 Ethylizer im Einsatz, die Zahl stieg bis Oktober 1924 auf über 17.000 an. Die ersten drei Plätze des Indianapolis-500-Rennens im Jahr 1923 belegten Rennwagen, die mit Tetraethylblei versetztes Benzin verwendet hatten, ein Ergebnis, das in der Presse besonders herausgestellt wurde. Etwa 18 Monate später betrug der Verkauf von verbleitem Benzin bereits 380 Millionen Liter pro Jahr.', 'Erstes Verbot von Tetraethylblei.', 'Arbe: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"1.

It's his way of providing them with the best possible meal.\\" Anna nodded and looked around the bakery. She noticed that all the other customers had bare feet too. She wondered if they all had stinky feet like hers and her grandma's. Soon enough, John came back with a delicious looking apple pie, and they both dug in. The pie was indeed the best they had ever tasted. They enjoyed their meal while John kept an eye on them and their feet. As they left the bakery, Anna said goodbye to John and her grandma whispered to her, \\"See, I told you his apple pie was worth the trouble.\\" Anna smiled and agreed, but she couldn't stop thinking about John's strange habit.

November 1989 konstituiert und auf ihrem ersten Parteitag am 9. Februar 1990 formell gegründet. Einen Tag nach der ersten gesamtdeutschen Bundestagswahl, am 3. Dezember 1990, fusionierte die Partei (mit Ausnahme des sächsischen Landesverbandes) mit den westdeutschen Grünen.', 'Die Partei ging wesentlich auf das 1988 gegründete Grün-Ökologische Netzwerk Arche zurück. Im April 1989 kündigte die Arche an, zur nächsten Volkskammerwahl mit einer von der Einheitsliste der Nationalen Front unabhängigen Grünen Liste antreten zu wollen. Dies war der erste Versuch in der Geschichte der DDR, den parlamentarischen Alleinvertretungsanspruch der SED-geführten Nationalen Front herauszufordern. Die Vorbereitungen zur Gründung der Partei verzögerten sich jedoch aufgrund von Widerständen innerhalb der Umweltbewegung, so dass während der politischen Umbrüche im Herbst 1989 andere Parteien vor der Grünen Partei gegründet wurden.', 'Die Grüne Partei war von Februar bis April 1990 mit einem Minister ohne Geschäftsbereich im Kabinett Modrow sowie nach der Wahl am 18. März 1990 mit acht Sitzen in der Volkskammer vertreten. Als Teil der Listenvereinigung Grüne/Bündnis 90 stellten die Grünen im ersten gesamtdeutschen Bundestag zwei der acht Abgeordneten. Da die westdeutschen Grünen an der Fünf-Prozent-Hürde scheiterten und sich wegen der im Vorfeld noch ausgebliebenen Fusion nicht auf das Wahlergebnis der ostdeutschen Liste stützen konnten, wie es bei einer bundesweiten Partei der Fall gewesen wäre, waren die beiden ostdeutschen Abgeordneten die einzigen Bundestagsabgeordneten der am folgenden Tag entstandenen gesamtdeutschen Grünen. Die Bundestagsgruppe von Grünen und Bündnis 90 war ein Vorreiter der Fusion zu einer gemeinsamen Partei 1993.', 'Von der Umweltbewegung zur Partei.', 'Vorgeschichte.', 'Der Ursprung der Partei liegt in der Umweltbewegung der DDR. In den 1980er Jahren entstanden als Folge der Umweltverschmutzung überall im Land Umweltgruppen. So gab es bis 1988 etwa 80 Umweltgruppen unter dem Dach der Kirche. Anfangs war die Beschäftigung mit Umweltthemen noch eng mit der Friedens- und Menschenrechtsbewegung verschränkt, erst Mitte der 1980er Jahre differenzierten sich zunehmend themenspezifische Gruppierungen heraus. Wichtige Themen waren unter anderem die Zerstörung der Umwelt durch den Tagebau, die Luftverschmutzung durch den massiven Einsatz der Braunkohle, der Uranbergbau der Wismut AG, die Umweltzerstörungen durch die chemische Industrie um Bitterfeld, die „Tonnenideologie“ der DDR-Wirtschaftspolitik und, besonders nach der Nuklearkatastrophe von Tschernobyl 1986, die Nutzung der Atomenergie.', 'Erste Pläne zur Gründung einer Grünen Partei gab es 1984. Bei einem Treffen von DDR-Umweltschützern mit Petra Kelly und Gert Bastian wurde erwogen, eine solche Partei als Sektion der westdeutschen Grünen zu gründen. Diese Überlegungen wurden jedoch fallengelassen, da es dazu keine legale Möglichkeit gab und eine Umsetzung die Mitglieder deshalb zwangsläufig kriminalisiert hätte, zudem waren die Pläne auch innerhalb der westdeutschen Grünen Partei nicht durchsetzbar. Einzelpersonen hatten immer wieder vage Pläne einer (grünen) Parteigründung, so Vera Wollenberger um 1984 oder Hans-Jochen Tschiche seit 1987.', '1986 gründete sich die Initiative Frieden und Menschenrechte (IFM), die sich für die Herstellung von Rechtsstaatlichkeit und für eine Demokratisierung der DDR einsetzte. Im selben Jahr wurde in den Kellerräumen der Berliner Zionskirchengemeinde die Umwelt-Bibliothek (UB) gegründet, die sich schnell zur wichtigsten Institution des Informationsaustausches der Umwelt-, aber auch der Friedens- und Menschenrechtsbewegung entwickelte. Bis dahin war das Kirchliche Forschungsheim in der Lutherstadt Wittenberg die einzige Einrichtung, die die lokalen Umweltgruppen koordinierte. Die Umwelt-Bibliothek gab die Samisdat-Zeitschrift „Umweltblätter“ (später „telegraph“) heraus, die bis zur Wende das bedeutendste Organ der DDR-Opposition war. Für eine effiziente DDR-weite Vernetzung der Ökogruppen fehlten der Umwelt-Bibliothek die Organisationsstrukturen, letztlich aber auch der Wille, solche überhaupt aufzubauen, da die unabhängigen Umweltgruppen stark auf Autonomie und Basisdemokratie setzten. So verlief eine Debatte über den Aufbau eines ökologischen Netzwerks auf dem dritten Berliner Ökologieseminar 1987 kontrovers und eine Gründung wurde mehrheitlich abgelehnt.', 'Deshalb ergriffen einzelne Vertreter verschiedener Umweltgruppen im Januar 1988 die Initiative und gründeten gegen das Diskussionsergebnis des Ökologieseminars das Grün-Ökologische Netzwerk Arche, dessen Strukturen und relativ hoher Organisationsgrad einer Partei bereits nahe kamen. Das föderale, auf dem demokratischen Vertretungsprinzip fußende Netzwerk war besonders innerhalb der basisdemokratisch-anarchistisch orientierten Berliner Umwelt-Bibliothek heftig umstritten. Im Kern basierte die Kritik auf einem durch die fast vollständige Durchinstitutionalisierung der realsozialistischen Gesellschaft hervorgerufenen tiefgreifendem Misstrauen der oppositionellen Gruppen in der DDR gegenüber Parteien und allen zentralistischen Organisationen. Die Differenzen führten dazu, dass die Arche-Mitglieder von der Mehrheit um Wolfgang Rüddenklau aus der Umwelt-Bibliothek ausgeschlossen wurden, darunter Carlo Jordan, der sowohl bei der Gründung der UB, als auch der Arche eine zentrale Rolle spielte. Statt die Gründungserklärung der Arche abzudrucken, veröffentlichten die Umweltblätter einen Unvereinbarkeitsbeschluss. Deshalb gab die Arche mit der „Arche Nova“ ein für damalige Verhältnisse professionell gestaltetes, bis zu achtzig Seiten umfassendes und in einer Auflage von mehreren tausend Exemplaren erscheinendes eigenes Samisdat heraus.', 'Die Spaltung der kirchlichen Umweltszene lag ganz im Interesse der Staatssicherheit, die zu diesem Zweck mit Falk Zimmermann, dem späteren Parteisprecher Henry Schramm, dem späteren Finanzgeschäftsführer der Grünen Partei Mario Hamel und anderen inoffizielle Mitarbeiter in die Arche eingeschleust hatte.', 'Seit 1988 liefen, bestärkt durch intensive Kontakte zum osteuropäischen Netzwerk von Umweltgruppen „Greenway“, Vorbereitungen der Gruppe, eine parteiähnliche Vereinigung zu gründen. Anlässlich der Kommunalwahlen vom 7. Mai 1989 versuchte die Arche wie auch andere oppositionelle Gruppen, Kandidaten auf der Liste der Nationalen Front zu platzieren, was aber misslang. Deshalb wurde auf einem Sprechertreffen Ende April 1989 in Halle beschlossen, für die nächste Volkskammerwahl 1991 eigene Kandidaten in einer „Grünen Liste“ aufzustellen. Diese sollte nicht nur Umweltschützern, sondern auch Kandidaten der Friedens- und Menschenrechtsbewegung offenstehen. Der Plan wurde bereits im Vorfeld der Kommunalwahlen, am 26. April 1989, auf einer Veranstaltung in Berlin öffentlich erklärt. Diese „Erklärung zur Kommunalwahl“ erschien am Tag vor der Wahl auch in der taz und im West-Berliner Radio 100. Der Historiker und Journalist Hans Michael Kloth sieht in diesem zielgerichteten Versuch, mit der Grünen Liste eine zur Einheitsliste der Nationalen Front konkurrierende Wahlliste an einer Wahl teilnehmen zu lassen, die erste offene Herausforderung des parlamentarischen Alleinvertretungsanspruchs der SED in der Geschichte der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik. Nach der Aufdeckung des Wahlbetrugs bei den Kommunalwahlen vom 7. Mai trat am 3. Juni 1989 ein Arche-Vertreter auf dem ersten Berliner Umwelttag in der Treptower Bekenntniskirche mit konkreten Forderungen nach sofortigen Neuwahlen unter Zulassung der Grünen Liste an die Öffentlichkeit.', 'Parteigründung.', 'Die politischen Umbrüche im Herbst 1989 änderten die Voraussetzungen für die Konstituierung einer Partei grundlegend. Seit August 1989 wurden auch in anderen oppositionellen Gruppen Parteien oder parteiähnliche Vereinigungen vorbereitet. Am 9. September wurde das Neue Forum als Sammlungsbewegung, am 12. September die Bürgerbewegung Demokratie Jetzt und am 7. Oktober mit der Sozialdemokratischen Partei in der DDR (SDP) die erste unabhängige Partei in der DDR gegründet. Im Dezember folgte der ebenfalls als politische Partei konzipierte Demokratische Aufbruch (DA). Diese Dynamik erhöhte den Druck, den Prozess einer grünen Parteigründung zu beschleunigen, insbesondere, weil das grüne Themenfeld von anderen Gruppen besetzt zu werden drohte. Das Neue Forum stellte Wirtschaft und Ökologie noch vor der politischen Teilhabe an erste Stelle eines Problemkatalogs und der Demokratische Aufbruch versuchte, eine grüne Partei zu verhindern, um die Umweltaktivisten an sich binden zu können.', 'Zunächst versuchte die Arche, die geplante Wahlliste als „Grüne Liste im Neuen Forum“ anzusiedeln. Wegen der unklaren Organisationsstruktur des Neuen Forums erschien diese Option jedoch als unsicher, zumal insbesondere Bärbel Bohley und Reinhard Schult keinen „Parteiklüngel“ im Neuen Forum haben wollten. Auch Gespräche mit staatlichen Organisationen, namentlich der „Interessengemeinschaft Stadtökologie“ der Gesellschaft für Natur und Umwelt im Kulturbund, verliefen ergebnislos und es kam teilweise zu heftigen Auseinandersetzungen. Viele Einzelmitglieder der sich seit etwa 1986 zunehmend emanzipierenden Stadtökologiegruppen fanden jedoch in den folgenden Monaten den Weg in die neu entstehende Partei, darunter Klaus-Dieter Feige, Bundestagsabgeordneter ab 1990, Ernst Dörfler und Bernd Reichelt, beide Mitglieder der Volkskammerfraktion 1990, Marianne Dörfler, Mitglied des ersten Sprecherrats, sowie Olaf Möller, Landtagsabgeordneter in Thüringen ab 1990.', 'In einem Gründungsaufruf vom 5. November 1989 nannte eine „Initiativgruppe zur Gründung einer Grünen Partei in der DDR“ als ihre Hauptziele den Umweltschutz, den ökologischen Umbau der DDR sowie Friedenssicherung und Gleichberechtigung von Mann und Frau. Vorgelegt wurde der Aufruf von 15 zumeist der Arche angehörenden und aus Berlin stammenden Mitgliedern der Initiativgruppe auf dem 6. Berliner Ökologieseminar in der Bekenntniskirche. Bereits im Vorfeld des Treffens hatten unter anderem Hans-Peter Gensichen und Olaf Möller in der gesamten DDR Rundbriefe verschickt, in denen sie sich strikt gegen die geplante Parteigründung aussprachen.

Außerhalb von Japan bezeichnet er meist ausschließlich aus Japan stammende Comics, wird aber auch für nichtjapanische Werke verwendet, die visuell und erzählerisch stark an japanische Vorbilder angelehnt sind. Eine klare Abgrenzung von Manga durch Stilmerkmale ist wegen der großen formalen und inhaltlichen Vielfalt des Mediums in Japan nicht möglich. Zu den wichtigsten vom Manga beeinflussten Comickulturen gehören die koreanischen Manhwa sowie Manhua aus dem chinesischen Raum. Viele als typisch angesehene Stilelemente von Manga finden sich auch im japanischen Animationsfilm, dem Anime, wieder.', 'In Japan stellen Manga einen bedeutenden Teil der Literatur sowie der Medienlandschaft dar. Der Mangamarkt ist der weltweit größte Comicmarkt. Die Wurzeln des japanischen Comics reichen bis ins Mittelalter zurück. Seine heutige Form ist jedoch wesentlich durch die westlichen Einflüsse im 19. und 20. Jahrhundert geprägt. Seit den 1990er Jahren sind Mangas neben Animes und Computerspielen ein erfolgreiches kulturelles Exportgut Japans.', 'Definition, Begriffsabgrenzung und Begriffsgeschichte.', 'Ähnlich wie der westliche Begriff „Comic“ ist auch „Manga“ in seiner Bedeutung eher unscharf und stark abhängig von Kontext, Motiven der Verwendung und Adressaten des Begriffs. Im westlichen Sprachgebrauch versteht man unter Manga in erster Linie Comics, das heißt in Bildfolgen erzählte Geschichten oder Vorgänge, japanischen Ursprungs. Im erweiterten Sinne werden auch Werke aus anderen Ländern vom Begriff erfasst, die sich der japanischen Zeichentradition zuordnen lassen und typische Stilelemente des Mangas aufweisen. Da diese jedoch breit gefächert sind, einer zeitlichen Veränderung unterliegen und sich mit anderen Comickulturen überschneiden, ist diese Zuordnung stets subjektiv. So bürgerte sich im englischen Sprachraum der Begriff OEL Manga (Original English Language Manga) für japanisch beeinflusste Werke ein. Als allgemeinere Bezeichnung gibt es den „global manga“, zu dem selbst Manhwa aus Korea gezählt werden können. Während dieses – vor allem von Fans vertretene – Verständnis von Manga ausländische Produktionen einschließt, werden experimentelle oder europäisch aussehende japanische Werke oft davon ausgeschlossen, da sie nicht dem erwarteten Stil entsprechen. Des Weiteren wird der Begriff Manga von Verlagen unter Marketinggesichtspunkten immer wieder anders eingesetzt. Beispielsweise etablierte sich unter amerikanischen Verlegern ein Verständnis von Manga als „Comic-Taschenbücher einer gewissen Größe und Preisklasse, die sich vor allem an Mädchen und Frauen richten“. Die genaue Definition und Abgrenzung von Manga ist Gegenstand stetiger Debatten sowohl unter Fans als auch im wissenschaftlichen Diskurs.', 'Als kennzeichnende Merkmale einer Definition von Manga nach Stilmerkmalen werden eine niedliche bis kindliche Darstellung der Figuren, oft mit großen Augen, eine hochgradig kodifizierte Bildsprache und lange, filmartig erzählte Geschichten sowie dafür eingesetzte Erzählstrategien, Bild- und Seitengestaltungen verwendet. Für die Kombination dieser Merkmale – insbesondere die des Charakterdesigns – wird auch die Bezeichnung \\"Japanese Visual Language\\" (JVL, dt. „japanische visuelle Sprache“, nach Neil Cohn) verwendet, ohne dass diese dabei per se als Definition von Manga herangezogen werden. Die Merkmale treffen auch nur auf einen Teil der japanischen Comickultur zu, der jedoch außerhalb Japans besonders präsent ist und daher das Bild prägt. Oft werden sie auch mit der Veröffentlichungsform als Serien kleinformatiger Taschenbücher identifiziert und so beispielsweise gemeinsam mit Comics als serielle Veröffentlichungen zu Bilderbüchern abgegrenzt. Auch speziell in Japan verbreitete Veröffentlichungsformen wie Magazine und dortige Produktionsprozesse werden als Merkmal herangezogen, wobei diese und das Format bereits wieder einen besonderen Japanbezug aufweisen. Ebenso werden viele der stilistischen Merkmale bisweilen auf japanische Kulturmerkmale zurückgeführt, sodass auch eine Definition von Manga nach Stilmerkmalen indirekt auf eine Definition nach japanischem Ursprung zurückgeführt werden kann. In einem Überblick über verschiedene Definitionsversuche stellt Zoltan Kacsuk fest, dass sich alle direkt oder indirekt auf Japan beziehen. Bei einer Definition nach Stil folgt dieser den Veränderungen in Japan, während stilistische Änderungen außerhalb Japans eher als Abrücken vom Manga selbst betrachtet werden. Die Kombination der üblichen Stil-, Genre- und Erzählmerkmale, die Veröffentlichungsform in Magazinen und der damit fast zwangsläufig verbundene japanische Ursprung ergeben ein Verständnis von Manga im engeren beziehungsweise engsten Sinne („Manga Proper“ nach Jaqueline Berndt). Frederik L. Schodt fasst Manga zusammen als „eine japanische Erzählkunst mit langer Tradition, die eine aus dem Westen importierte physische Form angenommen hat“.', 'In Japan selbst wird der Begriff „Manga“, wie auch „Comic“ (), für alle Arten von Comics verwendet, unabhängig von ihrer Herkunft. So allgemein verwendet, wird er oft in Katakana geschrieben. Neben Bildgeschichten werden auch Einzelbilder im üblichen Stil von Comics und Karikaturen als Manga bezeichnet. In Japan ist das Bild vom Manga im Gegensatz zum Westen statt nur von langen Geschichten auch durch Comicstrips geprägt. Jedoch ist das Wort „Manga“ lange Zeit als umgangssprachlich wahrgenommen worden, so dass von Seiten der Verleger „komikku / komikkusu“ häufiger verwendet wird, da das Wort kultivierter klinge. Die japanische Comicforschung begreift Manga vorrangig als in Magazinen erscheinende, serielle grafische Erzählform. In der öffentlichen Wahrnehmung Japans und in der Forschung auch über Japan hinaus bestehen zwei Begrifflichkeiten vom Manga: die japanische Comickultur nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg oder die Gesamtheit aller in Japan entstandenen Comics und Bildgeschichten seit dem frühen Mittelalter. Während ihrer Entstehung und noch bis Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts wurden auch japanische Animationsfilme als „Manga“, später „Manga Eiga“ (, „Manga-Filme“) bezeichnet. Ab den 1970er Jahren setzte sich dann der Begriff Anime durch und Manga Eiga wird heute nur noch wenig verwendet, insbesondere aber vom Studio Ghibli.', 'Für das Wort „Manga“ finden sich verschiedene direkte Übersetzungen. Darunter sind „spontan“, „impulsiv“, „ziellos“, „unwillkürlich“, „bunt gemischt“, „ungezügelt / frei“, „wunderlich / skurril“ und „unmoralisch“ für die erste Silbe, die zweite bedeutet „Bild“. Das Wort bzw. die Kombination der Zeichen, die wie alle japanischen Sinnzeichen aus China stammen, ist seit dem 12. Jahrhundert in Japan in Gebrauch, doch änderte sich die Bedeutung danach häufig und drastisch. So ordnet Hirohito Miyamoto als erste Verwendung die Bezeichnung eines Löffler-Vogels (, hier in der Lesung \\"mankaku\\") zu, später eine Bezeichnung für chaotisches Schreiben oder Zeichnen, in der der Vogel als Metapher dient, und schließlich für „Produktion und Sammlung großer Mengen von Zeichnungen unterschiedlicher Motive in verschiedenen Stilen“. Die Einführung der heutigen Bedeutung oder sogar die Erfindung wird oft dem Künstler Katsushika Hokusai zugeschrieben, jedoch verwendete er es weder als erster noch in der heutigen Bedeutung, sondern noch im Sinne von „Sammlung von Zeichnungen“. Wahrscheinlich machte er es jedoch als Bezeichnung für seine Holzschnitte populärer, sodass es Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts in neuem Begriffsinhalt wieder aufgegriffen wurde: „Manga“ bezeichnete nun Karikaturen, einfache humoristische Zeichnungen sowie Zeichenkunst allgemein. Dabei war im Kontext mit politischen Karikaturen die Bedeutung als „ungezügelt/frei“ besonders wichtig. Schließlich wurde das Wort von Kitazawa Rakuten für seine Comicserien aufgegriffen. In der Bezeichnung für diese festigte sich der Begriff in der folgenden Zeit und setzte sich nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg endgültig durch. In jüngerer Zeit gab es mehrere Versuche, das Wort umzudeuten beziehungsweise umzuschreiben, um seine unmittelbare Bedeutung dem Medium entsprechend neutraler zu halten. Darunter waren eine Schreibweise als MAN画, „\\"MAN\\"“ im Sinne von engl. „Menschheit“ und „erwachsen“, oder eine Änderung des ersten Zeichens in das ebenfalls als „man“ ausgesprochenes Zeichen „万“ für „Zehntausende, Alles“.', 'In den westlichen, das heißt zunächst den englischen, Sprachgebrauch eingeführt wurde der Begriff durch Frederik L. Schodt durch sein Buch \\"Manga! Manga! The World of Japanese Comics\\" von 1983 als Bezeichnung für japanische Comics. In den 1990er Jahren etablierte sich der Begriff in diesem Sinne – auch in Europa. Seit zunehmend außerhalb Japans Comics entstehen, die sich stark an japanischen Vorbildern orientieren, und das Bild vom Manga durch die über längere Zeit international erfolgreichen Serien geprägt wird, wird der Begriff auch im weiteren Sinne oder bezogen auf Stilmerkmale verwendet.', 'Entwicklung der japanischen Comics.', 'Wissenschaftliche Kontroverse.', 'In der Kulturwissenschaft ist umstritten, zu welcher Zeit der Manga entstand beziehungsweise ab wann man bei japanischen Comics von Manga sprechen kann. Die Ansichten reichen von einer Ursprungssuche in der mittelalterlichen japanischen Kultur mit ihren Karikaturen und Bildrollen über die Satiren, Drucke und Skizzen der Edo-Zeit, deren heute bekanntester Künstler Katsushika Hokusai ist, über die Umbrüche in der japanischen Kultur und die Einflüsse des Westens um 1900, als Kitazawa Rakuten das Medium prägte, bis zu Osamu Tezuka, der nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg neue Erzählformen und Themen fand. Die Auffassung einer weit in die Vergangenheit zurückreichenden Geschichte des Mangas gerät zunehmend in Kritik. Sie ignoriere Brüche in der japanischen Kulturgeschichte und diene dazu, Manga als Kulturgut gegen Vorurteile gegenüber Massenmedien zu verteidigen, sowie Manga aus politischen Gründen als urjapanisches Kulturgut auszuweisen. Dabei würden die starken westlichen Einflüsse seit dem Ende des 19. Jahrhunderts, die für den heutigen Manga von großer Bedeutung sind, verschwiegen oder durch bewusste Wahl der historischen und modernen Beispiele ausgeblendet. Es bestehen erzählerisch wie stilistisch große Differenzen zwischen heutigem Manga und der japanischen Kunst bis ins 19. Jahrhundert.

Sie besitzt reichen Tropfsteinschmuck mit stattlichen Stalagmiten und Stalaktiten und gilt als eine der schönsten Schauhöhlen in Deutschland. Sie liegt im Landkreis Bayreuth, annähernd in der Mitte zwischen Nürnberg und Bayreuth, und ist Mitglied der Erlebniswelt Jurahöhle. Das gewaltige Höhlenportal – das „Tor zur Unterwelt“ – liegt auf etwa 400 Meter über Normalnull zwischen Pottenstein und der Schüttersmühle, etwa zwei Kilometer südlich von Pottenstein im engen Tal des Weihersbachs am westlichen Steilhang. Der Höhleneingang, ein 25 Meter breites und 14 Meter hohes Portal, einer der größten Höhleneingänge in Deutschland, ist schon lange Zeit bekannt gewesen. Dieses Höhlenportal endete früher nach etwa 85 Meter Tiefe und wurde \\"Teufelsloch\\" genannt. Hans Brand aus Bayreuth, ein Geologe und Bergbauingenieur, späterer SS-Standartenführer, hat im Jahr 1922 eine etwa neun Meter dicke Abschlusswand, gebildet durch einen Versturz, im Teufelsloch durchbrochen und tropfsteingeschmückte Höhlenteile entdeckt, die bis August 1923 gangbar gemacht und für Besucher einstweilen freigegeben wurden. In einer weiteren Erschließungsmaßnahme wurden ab 1923 innerhalb von acht Jahren weitere Höhlenräume erschlossen und mit insgesamt etwa 300 Meter langen Stollen miteinander verbunden. An Pfingsten im Jahr 1931 wurde die Teufelshöhle der Öffentlichkeit zur vollständigen Besichtigung freigegeben.', 'Die Höhle besteht aus mehreren großen Hallen, die durch bei der Erschließung der Höhle bergmännisch angelegte enge, stollenartige Gänge miteinander verbunden sind. Unter Einbeziehung aller Seitengänge, der Stollen und der zur Erschließung der Höhle angelegten Förderschächte beträgt die Länge der Höhle etwa 3000 Meter. Der Schauhöhlenteil hat eine Länge von etwa 1700 Metern, wovon etwa 800 bei Führungen begehbar sind. Mit mehr als 140.000 Besuchern im Jahr gehört die Teufelshöhle, die vom \\"Zweckverband Teufelshöhle\\" betrieben wird, zu den besucherstärksten Schauhöhlen in Europa. In Deutschland hat nur die Atta-Höhle in Attendorn vergleichbare Besucherzahlen. Die Teufelshöhle wird für verschiedene Zwecke genutzt. So findet neben den regelmäßigen Führungen seit 1994 mehrmals in den Sommermonaten die Veranstaltungsreihe \\"Kultur in der Teufelshöhle\\" in der Eingangshöhle statt. In einem Seitenstollen befindet sich seit 1986 das \\"Therapiezentrum Teufelshöhle\\" zur Anwendung der Speläotherapie im Rahmen von Therapiekuren. In einem weiteren Seitenteil wird seit 1970 von der Forschungsgruppe \\"Höhle und Karst Franken\\" das einzige Höhlenlabor in Deutschland unterhalten.', 'Geologie.', 'Die Teufelshöhle liegt in einem typischen Karstgebiet mit säurelöslichen Gesteinen wie Kalk und Dolomit. Das Weihersbachtal und die Teufelshöhle entstanden im Wesentlichen in den letzten 2,5 Millionen Jahren. Die Teufelshöhle befindet sich im Frankendolomit, dem Malm Delta des Juras. Die Verkarstungsphase, beeinflusst durch den Wechsel verschiedener Eiszeiten mit wärmeren Perioden, dauert noch an.', 'Die überwiegende Entstehung der Teufelshöhle fiel in die Zeit, als die durch Verwerfungen entstandenen Klüfte und Spalten vollständig mit eingedrungenem kohlensäurehaltigem Wasser ausgefüllt waren. Kohlensäure ist zwar eine relativ schwache Säure, kann jedoch Kalk- und Dolomitgestein auflösen. Die Klüfte und Spalten haben sich durch Laugung zu großen Hohlräumen entwickelt. Durch das Vertiefen des Weihersbachtales und das dadurch bedingte Absinken des Grundwasserspiegels wurden die Hohlräume trockengelegt. Danach wurde die Höhle durch Raumerweiterungen und Tropfsteinbildungen gestaltet. Es handelt sich also um eine sogenannte \\"Sekundärhöhle\\", die erst lange Zeit nach der Bildung des Gesteins entstand. Bemerkenswert ist das Vorkommen von Höhlenlehm, der einen hohen Eisengehalt hat.', 'Die Teufelshöhle besteht aus mehreren natürlichen, aus dem Fels gelaugten Gangsystemen und Hohlräumen. Bei einer Führung durch den Schauhöhlenbereich werden drei große Hohlräume begangen, die teilweise durch künstlich angelegte stollenartige Gänge miteinander verbunden sind. Die hallenartigen Hohlräume weisen enorme Größen auf: Der \\"Kuppelsaal\\", der schon vor der Erschließung als das \\"Große Teufelsloch\\" bekannt war, hat bei einer Grundfläche von etwa 100 Quadratmetern eine Höhe von mehr als zehn Metern; eine 15 Meter mächtige Felsdecke liegt darüber. Der \\"Barbarossadom\\" ist etwa 45 Meter lang, 18 Meter breit und bis zu 18 Meter hoch, mit einer darüber liegenden Felsendecke von 52 Metern Mächtigkeit.

Es erstreckt sich über insgesamt drei Stockwerke bei einer Grundfläche von etwa 200 × 200 Metern. Der Führungsteil der Höhle geht ebenfalls durch alle drei Stockwerke, wobei die begehbare Grundfläche etwa 100 × 100 Meter beträgt. Das Höhlensystem umfasst neben dem Eingangsbereich der Teufelshöhle das ehemalige \\"Große Teufelsloch\\" und mit Stollen verbundene weitere Höhlen wie das \\"Kleine Teufelsloch\\". Mit diesem ist der \\"Brennnesselbau\\" verbunden, der zur Talseite hin einen ausgegrabenen Ausgang hat.

Eindringendes Regenwasser, mit Kohlensäure angereichert, löst auf dem Weg durch den Dolomitfels Kalk und hat so über viele Jahrtausende die Tropfsteinformationen, Sinter genannt, gebildet. Der \\"Barbarossadom\\" ist geprägt durch viele Kerzenstalagmiten am Boden sowie Stalaktiten und Sinterröhrchen an der Decke. Große Sinterfahnen und Sintervorhänge (beispielsweise der \\"Barbarossabart\\" im Barbarossadom) haben sich an mehreren Stellen in der Höhle gebildet. Auch die seltenen Excentriques haben sich in der Höhle geformt. Die verschiedenen Farbnuancen der Tropfsteine entstehen durch Beimengungen von Sand, Eisen, Mangan, oder Lehm. Die Tropfsteine der Teufelshöhle bestehen aus gewöhnlichem kohlesauren Kalk (Calciumcarbonat), obwohl das durch Wasser aufgelöste Ausgangsgestein eher dolomitischen Ursprungs ist.', 'Im Riesensaal sind die beiden ältesten Tropfsteine der Höhle zu sehen. Die großen Tropfsteingebilde wie der \\"Baum\\" oder der \\"Riese Goliath\\" sind einer sehr frühen Tropfsteinbildung zuzuordnen. Sie werden auf ein Alter von maximal 340.000 Jahren geschätzt. Wesentlich jünger dagegen sind die schlankeren Kerzenstalagmiten, deren Generation meist zu einer nacheiszeitlichen Periode (Würmeiszeit) gehört. Ihr Alter wird auf 10.000 bis 15.000 Jahre geschätzt. Der Tropfsteinschmuck der Teufelshöhle gehört nach morphologischen Kriterien überwiegend einer nacheiszeitlichen und damit sehr jungen Generation an. Dafür spricht auch der äußerst geringe Anteil zerstörter Tropfsteine, wie zum Beispiel gefällter oder umgestürzter Stalagmiten, deren Zerstörung auf natürliche Umstände, wie Erdbeben oder sich bewegendes Eis, zurückzuführen ist. In der Teufelshöhle dauert es durchschnittlich 13 Jahre, bis ein Tropfstein um etwa einen Millimeter gewachsen ist (eine Messeinrichtung befindet sich im Höhlenlabor). Nur in warmen Perioden der Erdgeschichte und bei ausreichendem Niederschlag wachsen die Tropfsteine.', 'Höhlenklima.', 'In der Teufelshöhle ist die Lufttemperatur recht konstant. Jahreszeitlich bedingt, schwankt sie zwischen 9 und 10 °C. Die relative Luftfeuchtigkeit ist mit etwa 95 Prozent, in einzelnen Höhlenbereichen bis zu 98 Prozent, sehr hoch. Vor einigen Jahren wurden im \\"Riesensaal\\" Temperaturmessungen über einen längeren Zeitraum durchgeführt. Dabei wurde ein Wert von 9,5 bis 10 °C ermittelt. Vor der Ausleuchtung der Höhle mit LED-Lampen erhöhte sich in den Sommermonaten an den Wochenenden bei starkem Besucherandrang und langer Beleuchtungsdauer die Temperatur im Riesensaal auf 12,5 bis 13 °C. Seit der Installation der LED-Lampen, die eine geringere Wärmeentwicklung und Abstrahlung als die alte Beleuchtung aufweisen, ist keine nennenswerte Temperaturerhöhung mehr zu verzeichnen. Während dieser Untersuchungen wurde auch der Niederschlag von Textilstaub aus der Kleidung der Besucher gemessen. Dazu wurden quadratische Messflächen von 10 mal 10 Zentimetern an verschiedenen Stellen im Riesensaal ausgelegt. Bei diesen Messungen hat sich eine nicht unerhebliche Beschmutzung der Höhlenluft herausgestellt.

While our stories don’t seem to have much in common, both underscore the insidious, almost sneaky nature of heart disease: my risk should have been obvious, based on my family history, while Anahad’s disease remained all but invisible until he happened to have a calcium scan, which is not normally done on healthy-seeming people in their thirties. We only learned of our risk thanks to dumb luck, because few doctors would have considered screening either of us for heart disease at our ages. Together, our stories illustrate three blind spots of Medicine 2.0 when it comes to dealing with atherosclerotic disease: first, an overly simplistic view of lipids that fails to understand the importance of total lipoprotein burden (apoB) and how much one needs to reduce it in order to truly reduce risk; second, a general lack of knowledge about other bad actors such as Lp(a); and third, a failure to fully grasp the lengthy time course of atherosclerotic disease, and the implications this carries if we seek true prevention. When I look at a patient’s blood panel for the first time, my eyes immediately dart to two numbers: apoB and Lp(a). I look at the other numbers, too, but these two tell me the most when it comes to predicting their risk of ASCVD. ApoB not only tells me the concentration of LDL particles (which, you’ll recall, is more predictive of disease than the concentration of cholesterol found within LDL particles, LDL-C), but it also captures the concentration of VLDL particles, which as members of the apoB family can also contribute to atherosclerosis. Furthermore, even someone whose apoB is low can still have a dangerously elevated Lp(a). [*6] Once you establish the central importance of apoB, the next question becomes, By how much does one need to lower it (or its proxy LDL-C) to achieve meaningful risk reduction? The various treatment guidelines specify target ranges for LDL-C, typically 100 mg/dL for patients at normal risk, or 70 mg/dL for high-risk individuals. In my view, this is still far too high. Simply put, I think you can’t lower apoB and LDL-C too much, provided there are no side effects from treatment. You want it as low as possible. As Peter Libby, one of the leading authorities on cardiovascular disease, and colleagues wrote in Nature Reviews in 2019, “Atherosclerosis probably would not occur [emphasis mine] in the absence of LDL-C concentrations in excess of physiological needs (on the order of 10 to 20 mg/dL).” Furthermore, the authors wrote: “If the entire population maintained LDL concentrations akin to those of a neonate (or to those of adults of most other animal species), atherosclerosis might well be an orphan disease.” Translation: if we all maintained the apoB levels we had when we were babies, there wouldn’t be enough heart disease on the planet for people to know what it was. Kind of like 3-hydroxyisobutyric aciduria. What, you haven’t heard of it? Well, that’s because there have been only thirteen reported cases. Ever. That is an orphan disease. I’m being a bit facetious, but my point is that atherosclerotic disease shouldn’t even be in the top ten causes of death, if we treated it more aggressively. Instead, we have over eighteen million cases of fatal atherosclerotic disease per year globally. Many doctors, and in fact many of you reading this, might be shocked to see such a low LDL-C target: 10 to 20 mg/dL? Most guidelines consider lowering LDL-C to 70 mg/dL to be “aggressive,” even for secondary prevention in high-risk patients, such as those who have already had a heart attack. It’s also natural to ask whether such extremely low levels of LDL-C and apoB are safe, given the ubiquity and importance of cholesterol in the human body. But consider the following: infants, who presumably require the most cholesterol, in order to meet the enormous demands of their rapidly growing central nervous system, have similarly low levels of circulating cholesterol, without any developmental impairment. Why? Because the total amount of cholesterol contained in all our lipoproteins—not just LDL, but also HDL and VLDL—represents only about 10 to 15 percent of our body’s total pool of cholesterol. So the concern is unwarranted, as demonstrated by scores of studies showing no ill effects from extremely low LDL concentrations. This is my starting point with any patient, whether they are like Anahad (with one prominent risk factor) or like me (lots of smaller risk factors). Our first order of business is to reduce the burden of apoB particles, primarily LDLs but also VLDLs, which can be dangerous in their own right. And do so dramatically, not marginally or incrementally. We want it as low as possible, sooner rather than later. We must also pay attention to other markers of risk, notably those associated with metabolic health, such as insulin, visceral fat, and homocysteine, an amino acid that in high concentrations [*7] is strongly associated with increased risk of heart attack, stroke, and dementia. You’ll note that I don’t pay much attention to HDL-C, because while having very low HDL-C is associated with higher risk, it does not appear to be causal. This is why drugs aimed at raising HDL-C have generally failed to reduce risk and events in clinical trials. The reasons why are suggested by two elegant Mendelian randomization studies that examined both sides of the HDL-C question: Does low HDL-C causally increase the risk of myocardial infarction? No. Does raising HDL-C causally lower the risk of myocardial infarction? No. Why? Probably because whatever benefit HDLs provide in the battle for arterial supremacy, it (again) seems to be driven by their function—which doesn’t seem to be related to their cholesterol content. But we cannot test for HDL functionality, and until we have a better grasp on how HDL actually works, it will likely remain elusive as a target of therapy. — Lipoproteins aren’t the only significant risk factors for cardiovascular disease; as noted earlier, smoking and high blood pressure both damage the endothelium directly. Smoking cessation and blood pressure control are thus non-negotiable first steps in reducing cardiovascular risk. We’ll talk about nutrition in much more detail, but my first step in controlling my own cardiovascular risk was to begin to change my own diet, so as to lower my triglycerides (a contributor to apoB when they are high, as mine were), but more importantly to manage my insulin levels. I needed to get my metabolic house in order. I should note that my own solution at the time, a ketogenic diet, might not work for everyone, nor is it a diet to which I continue to adhere. In my clinical experience, about a third to half of people who consume high amounts of saturated fats (which sometimes goes hand in hand with a ketogenic diet) will experience a dramatic increase in apoB particles, which we obviously don’t want. [*8] Monounsaturated fats, found in high quantities in extra virgin olive oil, macadamia nuts, and avocados (among other foods), do not have this effect, so I tend to push my patients to consume more of these, up to about 60 percent of total fat intake. The point is not necessarily to limit fat overall but to shift to fats that promote a better lipid profile. But for many patients, if not for most, lowering apoB to the levels we aim for—the physiologic levels found in children—cannot be accomplished with diet alone, so we need to use nutritional interventions in tandem with drugs. Here we are fortunate because we have more preventive options in our armamentarium than we do for cancer or neurodegenerative disease. Statins are far and away the most prescribed class of drugs for lipid management, but there are several other options that might be right for a given individual, and often we need to combine classes of drugs, so it’s not uncommon for a patient to take two lipid-lowering drugs that operate via distinct mechanisms. These are typically thought of as “cholesterol-lowering” medications, but I think we are better served to think about them in terms of increasing apoB clearance, enhancing the body’s ability to get apoBs out of circulation. That’s really our goal. Mostly this is done by amplifying the activity of LDL receptors (LDLR) in the liver, which absorb cholesterol from the bloodstream. Different drugs arrive at this effect via different paths. Typically our first line of defense (or attack), statins inhibit cholesterol synthesis, prompting the liver to increase the expression of LDLR, taking more LDL out of circulation. They may have other benefits too, including an apparent anti- inflammatory effect, so while I don’t think statins should be dissolved into the drinking water, as some have suggested, I do think they are very helpful drugs for reducing apoB or LDL concentration in many patients. Not everyone can take statins comfortably; about 5 percent of patients experience deal-breaking side effects, most notably statin-related muscle pain. Also, a smaller but nonzero subset of patients taking statins experience a disruption in glucose homeostasis, which may explain why statins are associated with a small increase in the risk for type 2 diabetes. Another fraction of patients experience an asymptomatic rise in liver enzymes, which is even more common in patients also taking the drug ezetimibe. All these side effects are completely and rapidly reversible when the drug is discontinued. But for those who can tolerate them (i.e., most people), I deploy them early and often. (For more on specific statin and other apoB-lowering medications, see the sidebar on this page.) — This brings us to the final, and perhaps greatest, major blind spot of Medicine 2.0: time. The process I’ve outlined in this chapter unfolds very slowly—not over two or three or even five years, but over many decades. The fact that younger people have been found to have lesions and plaques, without suffering many events, tells us that there is a considerable period of time when the disease is not harmful. Dying from cardiovascular disease is certainly not inevitable: the centenarians delay it for decades, and many avoid it altogether, their arteries remaining as clean as those of people a generation younger. Somehow, they manage to slow the process down. Nearly all adults are coping with some degree of vascular damage, no matter how young and vital they may seem, or how pristine their arteries appear on scans. There is always damage, especially in regions of shear stress and elevated local blood pressure, such as curves and splits in the vasculature. Atherosclerosis is with us, in some form, throughout our life course. Yet most doctors consider it “overtreatment” to intervene if a patient’s computed ten- year risk of a major adverse cardiac event (e.g., heart attack or stroke) is below 5 percent, arguing that the benefits are not greater than the risks, or that treatment costs too much. In my opinion, this betrays a broader ignorance about the inexorable, long-term unfolding of heart disease. Ten years is far too short a time horizon. If we want to reduce deaths from cardiovascular disease, we need to begin thinking about prevention in people in their forties and even thirties. Another way to think of all this is that someone might be considered “low risk” at a given point—but on what time horizon? The standard is ten years. But what if our time horizon is “the rest of your life”? Then nobody is at low risk. When I had my first calcium scan in 2009, at the age of thirty-six, my tenyear risk was incalculably low—literally. The dominant mathematical models for risk assessment have a lower limit for age of forty or forty-five. My parameters could not even be entered into the models. So it’s no wonder nobody was alarmed by my findings. Despite my calcium score of 6, my tenyear risk of a heart attack was far less than 5 percent. In 2016, seven years after my initial calcium scan, I had a CT angiogram (the better, higher-res scan), which showed the same small speck of calcium but no evidence of additional soft plaque elsewhere. In 2022, I went back again for a repeat CT angiogram, and the result was the same. There was no indication whatsoever of soft plaque this time either, and only that tiny speck of calcium remained from 2009. [*9] Thus, at least at the resolution of the sharpest CT scanner commercially available, there is no reason to believe that my atherosclerosis has progressed over thirteen years. I have no idea if this means I’m free from risk—I frankly doubt it—but I no longer fear dying from cardiovascular disease the way I once did. My long, comprehensive program of prevention seems to have paid off. I feel a lot better now, at age fifty, than I did at age thirty-six, and my risk is a lot lower by any metric other than age. One major reason for this is that I started early, well before Medicine 2.0 would have suggested any intervention. Yet most physicians and cardiology experts would still insist that one’s thirties are too young to begin to focus on primary prevention of cardiac disease. This viewpoint is directly challenged by a 2018 JAMA Cardiology paper coauthored by Allan Sniderman, comparing ten-year versus thirty-year risk horizons in terms of prevention. Sniderman and colleagues’ analysis found that looking at a thirty-year time frame rather than the standard ten years and taking aggressive precautionary measures early—like beginning statin treatment earlier in certain patients—could prevent hundreds of thousands more cardiac events, and by implication could save many lives. For context, most studies of statins used in primary prevention (that is, prevention of a first cardiac event) last about five years and typically find a “number needed to treat” (or NNT, the number of patients who need to take a drug in order for it to save one life) of between about 33 and 130, depending on the baseline risk profile of the patients. (Amazingly, the longest statin trials to date have lasted just seven years.) But looking at their risk reduction potential over a thirty-year time frame, as the Sniderman study did, reduces the NNT down to less than 7: For every seven people who are put on a statin at this early stage, we could potentially save one life. The reason for this is simple math: risk is proportional to apoB exposure over time. The sooner we lower apoB exposure, thus lowering risk, the more the benefits compound over time—and the greater our overall risk reduction. This encapsulates the fundamental difference between Medicine 2.0 and Medicine 3.0 when it comes to cardiovascular disease. The former views prevention largely as a matter of managing relatively short-term risk. Medicine 3.0 takes a much longer view—and more importantly seeks to identify and eliminate the primary causative agent in the disease process: apoB. This changes our approach to treatment completely. For example, a forty-five-year-old with elevated apoB has a lower ten-year risk than a seventy-five-year-old with low apoB. Medicine 2.0 would say to treat the seventy-five-year-old (because of their age), but not the forty-five-year-old. Medicine 3.0 says to disregard the ten-year risk and instead treat the causal agent in both cases—lowering the forty-five-year-old’s apoB as much as possible. Once you understand that apoB particles—LDL, VLDL, Lp(a)—are causally linked to ASCVD, the game completely changes. The only way to stop the disease is to remove the cause, and the best time to do that is now. Still struggling with this idea? Consider the following example. We know that smoking is causally linked to lung cancer. Should we tell someone to stop smoking only after their ten-year risk of lung cancer reaches a certain threshold? That is, do we think it’s okay for people to keep smoking until they are sixty-five and then quit? Or should we do everything we can to help young people, who have maybe just picked up the habit, quit altogether? When viewed this way, the answer is unambiguous. The sooner you cut the head off the snake, the lower the risk that it will bite you. \\"","completion":"The insidious, sneaky nature of heart disease is exemplified by the stories of two individuals who both have risk factors for atherosclerotic disease, but with different presentations. The author stresses the importance of understanding the role of total lipoprotein burden (apoB) and the time course of atherosclerotic disease to achieve true prevention. The author advocates for aggressively lowering apoB and LDL-C to reduce risk, and highlights the need for a longer-term perspective when it comes to cardiovascular disease prevention. The goal is to eliminate the causal agent, apoB particles, and the best time to start prevention is now."},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: [['Pythons'], 'Der Grüne Baumpython (\\"Morelia viridis\\") ist eine baumbewohnende Schlange aus der Gattung der Rautenpythons (\\"Morelia\\") innerhalb der Familie der Pythons (Pythonidae). Die Art kommt auf Neuguinea, den vorgelagerten Inseln sowie auf der Kap-York-Halbinsel im Norden Australiens vor.', 'Beschreibung.', 'Der Grüne Baumpython zeichnet sich durch einen verhältnismäßig schlanken Körper aus, auf den relativ langen Schwanz entfallen etwa 14 % der Gesamtlänge. Der Kopf ist groß und deutlich vom Hals abgesetzt. Er ist auf der Oberseite posterior stark aufgewölbt, die Schnauze ist groß und eckig. Der Körper ist im Querschnitt dreieckig mit deutlich sichtbarer Wirbelsäule. Die Art erreicht eine Gesamtlänge von 150 bis 180 Zentimeter, große Weibchen erreichen eine Länge bis 200 Zentimeter. Die Größe variiert je nach Herkunftsgebiet. Das Gewicht hängt stark vom Ernährungszustand des Tieres ab. Männchen können etwa 1100 bis 1400 Gramm schwer werden, Weibchen bis 1600 Gramm, besonders große Exemplare bis 2200 Gramm. Die Weibchen sind, wie bei den meisten Schlangen, etwas größer und schwerer als die Männchen.', 'Beschuppung.', 'Das Rostrale ist groß, deutlich abgesetzt und oft so tief eingekerbt, dass die Schnauze vorn oft wie gespalten wirkt. Die Nasalia sind gewölbt und haben große, nach hinten und oben gerichtete Nasenlöcher. Die beiden Internasalia sind rund und durch mehrere kleinere Schuppen voneinander getrennt. Die Kopfoberseite zeigt sonst keine größeren Schuppen, zwischen den Augen können sich 20 kleine Schuppen befinden.', 'In der Seitenansicht befinden sich zwischen dem Nasale und dem Auge 60 oder mehr kleine, unregelmäßig geformte Zügelschilde (Lorealia). Es gibt keine deutlich ausgebildeten Präocularia oder Postocularia; um das Auge liegen 11–19 kleine Schuppen und zwei Supralabialia grenzen von unten an das Auge. Die Anzahl der Supralabialia kann zwischen 12 und 16 liegen, die ersten zwei zeigen tiefe, schräge Labialgruben, die dritte zeigt eine flache Mulde. Die hinteren 6–7 der insgesamt 14–18 Infralabialia zeigen tiefe Labialgruben.', 'Die Anzahl der Bauchschuppen (Ventralschilde) variiert zwischen 219 und 254, die Zahl der Subcaudalia zwischen 68 und 129 und die Anzahl der dorsalen Schuppenreihen in der Körpermitte zwischen 55 und 57. Neben dem Analschild können zwei in ihrer Ausprägung variable Aftersporne auftreten.', 'Färbung.', 'Die Grundfarbe adulter Tiere ist oberseits ein satter Grünton, der in vielen Schattierungen vorkommen kann, sehr selten treten auch rein blaue Exemplare auf. Auf diesem Grund sind etwa eine Schuppe breite, weiße Flecken verteilt, die häufig besonders konzentriert auf dem kielartigen Rücken auftreten und dort manchmal ein fast durchgehendes Band bilden. Gelegentlich sind diese Flecke zu größeren, flächigeren Flecken vereint. Die Färbung des Bauchs und der Lippen schwankt von beige-weiß bis hin zu gelb. Die Schwanzspitze ist bräunlich oder schwarz. Die Pupillen sind senkrecht geschlitzt und die Iris silberfarben.', 'Ungewöhnlich ist die Umfärbung der Jungtiere (ontogenetischer Farbwechsel), wie sie auch bei einigen anderen Schlangenarten vorkommt. Als Jungtier in einem leuchtenden Gelb oder Rot bis Rot-Braun gefärbt, nehmen die Tiere erst im Alter von sechs bis zehn Monaten ihre endgültige Färbung an. Die Schwanzspitze ist hellgelb und wird zum Anlocken von Beutetieren benutzt. Dieses Verhalten nimmt mit zunehmendem Alter ab, konnte aber auch bei adulten Tieren beobachtet werden. Der komplette Farbwechsel kann aber auch innerhalb weniger Wochen vollzogen werden oder bei manchen Tieren auch 2 bis 3 Jahre dauern. Warum die Jungtiere so eine leuchtende Farbe haben, ist nicht gänzlich geklärt. Man vermutet, dass auf diese Weise eine optimale Tarnung im Licht- und Schattenspiel des Regenwaldes möglich ist oder dass verschiedene natürliche Feinde das Jungtier für eine giftige Pflanze halten.', 'Verbreitung und Lebensraum.', 'Das Verbreitungsgebiet des Grünen Baumpythons erstreckt sich auf die tropischen Regenwälder auf Papua-Neuguinea, dessen vorgelagerte Inseln sowie auf die Kap-York-Halbinsel in Australien. Es wurden Vorkommen bis 2.000 Meter über dem Meeresspiegel nachgewiesen. Als westlichster Fundort wird die Insel Gag verzeichnet, als östlichster Punkt wurde die Insel Normanby gemeldet, eine Neuguinea vorgelagerte Insel. Die Entfernung zwischen diesen beiden Punkten beträgt circa 3.000 Kilometer Luftlinie.', 'In den Regenwaldgebieten ist keine Veränderung des Klimas in Zusammenhang mit der Jahreszeit zu verzeichnen. Die Niederschlagsmenge ist deutlich höher als die Verdunstungsrate und schwankt im Verbreitungsgebiet des Grünen Baumpythons standortbedingt zwischen 2.100 und 3.400 mm pro Jahr. Entsprechend ist auch die relative Luftfeuchtigkeit sehr hoch und beträgt tagsüber 70 bis 85 Prozent und steigt nachts auf Werte von 95 bis 100 Prozent an. Die Temperatur schwankt tagsüber zwischen 27 und 32 Grad Celsius und sinkt nachts auf 22 bis 25 Grad ab.', 'Verhalten.', 'Der Grüne Baumpython verbringt den Großteil seines Lebens in Bäumen oder Sträuchern. Im Nordosten Australiens halten sich Jungtiere in Höhen bis maximal 10 m auf, während adulte Exemplare meist Bäume über die gesamte Höhe nutzen und oft in Höhen über 25 m festgestellt werden. In den Ruhephasen nehmen die Tiere eine charakteristische Stellung ein. Dabei hängt der Körper in mehreren engen Schlingen über einem Ast, wobei der Kopf in der Mitte aufliegt.', 'Jagdweise und Ernährung.', 'Die Art ist ein Lauerjäger. Die wesentliche Jagdstrategie ist das bewegungslose Warten an einer geeigneten Stelle, bis Beute in Reichweite kommt. Der Grüne Baumpython ist dabei sehr standorttreu, an einer geeigneten Stelle halten sich die Tiere bis zu 14 Tage lang auf. Bei der Lauerjagd formt der Python mit dem vorderen Körperdrittel in einer Ebene eine annähernde „8“, so dass er mit dem Kopf sehr schnell eine bestimmte Distanz überbrücken und zubeißen kann. Für Jungtiere beträgt diese Distanz etwa 10 cm, bei größeren Tieren etwa 40 cm.', 'Detaillierte Untersuchungen zur Jagdaktivität und Ernährung wurden bisher nur im Nordosten Australiens durchgeführt. Die tageszeitliche Jagdaktivität war hier sowohl vom Geschlecht als auch von der Körpergröße abhängig. Jungtiere jagten überwiegend am Tag. Mit zunehmender Größe wurde die Jagdaktivität von beiden Geschlechtern immer stärker auf die Nacht verlegt. Männchen mit einer Kopf-Rumpf-Länge über 100 cm jagten fast ausschließlich nachts, Weibchen dieser Größe jagten noch zu 10–20 % am Tag. Das kleinräumige Jagdhabitat war alters- und tageszeitabhängig unterschiedlich. Jungtiere wurden niemals in Lauerposition am Boden angetroffen, immature und erwachsene Exemplare tagsüber in weniger als 1 % der Fälle. Nachts erfolgten bei immaturen Schlangen 15 % aller Nachweise in Lauerstellung auf dem Boden, bei adulten Tieren stieg dieser Anteil auf 29 %.', 'Die Nahrung besteht vor allem aus kleinen Säugetieren und Echsen, daneben werden auch Vögel und Insekten gefressen. Über Zufallsbeobachtungen hinausgehende Daten zur Ernährung liegen bisher wiederum nur aus Nordostaustralien vor, dort wurde das Beutespektrum anhand von acht Kotproben und vier direkten Beobachtungen ermittelt. Hauptbeutetier immaturer und adulter Tiere war die zu den Mosaikschwanzratten gehörende \\"Melomys capensis\\", die in fünf der acht Kotproben nachgewiesen wurde, weitere Beutetiere waren ein unbestimmter Skink, zwei unbestimmte Vögel sowie zwei Schmetterlinge. Für Jungschlangen wurden einmal der Skink \\"Carlia longipes\\", ein unbestimmter Skink und ein Käfer als Beute nachgewiesen.', 'Fortpflanzung.', 'Wie alle Pythons ist auch der Grüne Baumpython eierlegend (ovipar). Er ist eine nichtsaisonale Schlange. Das bedeutet, dass die Paarung, die Eiablage und der Schlupf der Jungtiere zu jeder Zeit des Jahres erfolgen können. Die meisten Paarungen finden von September bis Ende Oktober statt. Wenn die Schlangen ihre Geschlechtsreife im Alter von zweieinhalb bis drei Jahren erreicht haben, begeben sie sich auf die Suche nach einem Geschlechtspartner. Trifft das Weibchen mehrere Männchen zur Paarung an, sind auch Mehrfachpaarungen mit wechselnden Geschlechtspartnern möglich. Weibchen stellen einige Zeit nach der erfolgreichen Paarung die Nahrungsaufnahme ein und beginnen mit der Suche nach einem geeigneten Eiablageplatz. Bevorzugt werden höher gelegene Höhlen in Bäumen aufgesucht, wobei aber jede versteckte Stelle, die genügend Schutz vor Feinden und ausreichende Feuchtigkeit bietet, als Brutplatz angenommen wird. Das Weibchen legt gegen Februar bis März, nach 70 bis 90 Tagen Trächtigkeit seine 5 bis 35 Eier im Versteck ab. Die Größe des Geleges hängt mit der Größe und dem Alter des Weibchens zusammen. Wie die meisten Pythonarten betreibt auch der Grüne Baumpython Brutpflege. Das Weibchen legt 45 bis 65 Tage lang seine Körperschlingen um das Gelege und hält mit kräftigen Muskelkontraktionen die Temperatur auf 29,5 Grad Celsius. Steigt die Temperatur darüber, lockert es die Schlingen und lässt Luft an die Eier. Die Weibchen fasten von der Paarung bis zum Schlupf der Jungtiere für einen Zeitraum von vier bis fünf Monaten. Die Männchen nehmen dagegen bereits nach der Paarung wieder Nahrung auf. In freier Natur lebende Tiere haben vermutlich nur alle zwei Jahre Nachwuchs. Bei einigen Weibchen kann es mit Beginn der Trächtigkeit zu einer Umfärbung ins Blaue oder Türkise kommen. Nach dem Schlupf der Jungtiere färben sie sich dann zurück in den ursprünglichen Zustand. Selten bleibt auch eine leicht blaue Färbung erhalten.', 'In Gefangenschaft gehaltene Exemplare werden etwa 15 bis 20 Jahre alt. Die durchschnittliche Lebenszeit frei lebender Tiere ist unbekannt.', 'Haltung.', 'Aufgrund ihrer baumlebenden Lebensweise sollte \\"Morelia viridis\\" ein hohes Terrarium geboten werden. Zur Berechnung des Mindestmaßes sollte die Größe des Terrariums 0,75 × 0,5 × 1,0 (Länge × Tiefe × Höhe in Metern) mit der Länge des Tieres multipliziert werden, wobei die maximale Höhe auf 2 Meter begrenzt wird. Über die Richtigkeit dieses Mindestmaßes wird in Fachkreisen häufig diskutiert, weil auch in wesentlich kleineren Terrarien schon erfolgreich Baumpythons gehalten und nachgezogen wurden.

Sie liegt etwa drei Kilometer nördlich von Steinau an der Straße, zwischen dem Spessart im Süden und dem Vogelsberg im Norden, am Hang des Kieskopfes. Die Höhle ist etwa 2,5 Millionen Jahre alt und ein geologisches Naturdenkmal. Die Höhle wurde 1584 zufällig entdeckt. Die Bevölkerung mied die Höhle lange, weil sie glaubte, der Teufel lebe darin. Eine erste, kurze Begehung fand 1830 statt. Von 1905 bis 1908 wurde ein Zugangsstollen gegraben und die Höhle ausgebaut. Die elektrisch beleuchtete Schauhöhle wurde 1927 eröffnet. Sie ist auf einer Länge von 174 Metern begehbar und enthält drei größere Räume, von denen einer Tropfsteine enthält.', 'Geschichte.', 'Entdeckung.', 'Die Höhle wurde im Herbst des Jahres 1584 von dem Kuhhirten Jox Mellmann entdeckt. Eine Kuh hatte sich von der Herde entfernt und war durch die dünne Erdschicht in einen Hohlraum gefallen. Nach längerer Suche bemerkte Mellmann einen dunklen Schacht, in dem sie verschwunden sein musste. Er war der Überzeugung, dies könne nur das Werk des Teufels sein, der die Kuh gefressen habe. Ebenso sahen es die Bewohner der Gegend, die sehr abergläubisch waren. Das Loch wurde daraufhin \\"Teufelsloch\\" genannt. Um den Teufel zu vertreiben, warfen die Bewohner Steine hinein. Im Frondienst schafften die Bauern mehrere Monate lang Basaltblöcke dorthin. Auch verendete Tiere wurden in das Loch geworfen. Da sich die „Wohnung des Teufels“ nicht auffüllen ließ, war die Bevölkerung der Überzeugung, dass der Teufel zu mächtig sei, um ihn auf diese Weise zu bezwingen. Die Angst vor ihm war so groß, dass die Landwirte nur noch widerwillig zu der Wiese gingen. Das Loch diente dem Grafen von Hanau, der im Steinauer Schloss residierte, eine Zeit lang als Hundefriedhof.', 'Erschließung.', '1830 seilte sich der Papiermachergeselle Walter aus Steinau als erster Mensch in die Höhle ab. Als Fledermäuse um seinen Kopf flogen und Wasser auf ihn tropfte, ließ er sich aus Angst wieder aus dem Loch ziehen. Eine weitere Begehung der Höhle fand im Jahre 1898 statt. Am 14. Juni, nach anderer Überlieferung im Juli, ließen sich drei Männer, Straßenbaumeister Lüders als Organisator, Straßenwärter Methfessel und Dachdeckermeister Scheer, hinab. Sie waren mit Leitern, Seilen, Steigeisen und Haken ausgerüstet. Fackeln dienten ihnen zur Beleuchtung. Sie gelangten auf einen Schuttkegel im \\"Großen Dom\\". Nach dieser Befahrung wurde entschieden, die Höhle begehbar zu machen. Dazu sollte ein nahezu waagerechter Tunnel von außen zum Großen Dom gegraben werden. Als das nötige Geld vorhanden war, wurde 1905 mit den Grabungen begonnen.', 'Drei polnische Bergleute gruben sich drei Jahre lang mit Hammer und Meißel in den Berg und orientierten sich mit einem Kompass. Das herausgebrochene Material wurde mittels Hunten auf Schienen nach draußen transportiert. Nach einer Strecke von 45 Metern wurde ein bis dahin unbekannter, mit Tropfsteinen überzogener natürlicher Hohlraum, die \\"Kapelle\\", angefahren. Nach 54 Metern wurde schließlich der Große Dom erreicht. Dieser war mehrere Meter hoch mit Schutt und Knochen verfüllt. Um ihn begehbar zu machen, wurden insgesamt 300 Kubikmeter Material wie Basalt, eingeschwemmter Lehmboden, Baumstämme und Tierknochen hinaustransportiert. So entstand eine Plattform auf der gleichen Höhe wie der Eingangsstollen. Bei den Grabungen fand sich eine große Zahl an Tierknochen von Hunden, Ziegen, Rindern, Eseln, Katzen und Schweinen, die von Fritz Drevermann, Professor der Geologie und Paläontologie und Rektor der Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität Frankfurt am Main, gründlich untersucht und datiert wurden.', '1911 wurde beim Abgraben des Schuttkegels angeblich der Schädel eines \\"fossilen Menschen\\" gefunden. Über diesen Fund berichtete am 24. Juni 1911 die Schlüchterner Zeitung in einer Beilage mit dem Titel \\"Der Schädelfund im „Teufelsloch“ bei Steinau\\". Ein schwedischer Wissenschaftler bot für den seltenen Schädel 3000 Reichsmark. Über die Herkunft des Schädels gab es viele Theorien. Die Meinungen der Experten schwankten zwischen einem jugendlichen Neandertaler, einem Pygmäen oder gar einem Affen. Professor Otto zur Strassen bemerkte, dass der Schädel für ein Fossil viel zu gut erhalten sei, und vermutete, dass es sich um einen Schimpansenschädel handelte. Nach etwa einem Jahr und zahlreichen Untersuchungen und Reinigungen fand der Professor zwei Löcher mit Rostspuren, die von Nägeln herrührten, mit denen der Unterkiefer befestigt worden war. Es stellte sich heraus, dass ein Apotheker aus Steinau durch seinen in Afrika lebenden Bruder in den Besitz eines Affenschädels gekommen war. Er hatte diesen mit Chemikalien so präpariert, dass er wie ein mehrere Tausend Jahre alter Schädel aussah, und ihn im Schuttkegel der Höhle versteckt, so dass er bei den Ausgrabungen gefunden wurde. Er wollte damit dem Leiter der Grabungen, Straßenbaumeister Lüders, einen Streich spielen.', 'Am 11. November 1913 wurde der \\"Verein zur Erschließung der Tropfsteinhöhle\\" gegründet. Die Höhle mit ihrer Umgebung wurde am 10. März 1924 vom Chemiker, Geologen und Vorsitzenden des \\"Vereins für Höhlenkunde in Frankfurt am Main e. V.\\" Hans Karl Becker als Naturschutzgebiet ausgewiesen.', 'Schauhöhle.', '1927 wurde die erste elektrische Lichtanlage in der Höhle installiert und es fand die offizielle Eröffnung der Höhle statt. Im Zweiten Weltkrieg diente sie zeitweise als Luftschutzbunker für die Bewohner von Steinau. Nach dem Krieg befand sich die Höhle in der amerikanischen Besatzungszone. In der Kapelle brachen die Amerikaner mehrere bis über einen Meter lange Stalaktiten ab, die nebeneinander gewachsen und ohne Leiter erreichbar waren. Ein weiterer, etwa einen Meter langer Stalaktit, der sich an einer höheren Stelle befand, blieb verschont. 1952 wurde die Höhle wieder für Besucher zugänglich gemacht. In den 1970er Jahren wurde der Stalaktit bei Sicherungsarbeiten von einem Arbeiter für einen Auftraggeber abgebrochen und entwendet. Im Jahre 1976 fanden geologische und geophysikalische Untersuchungen in der Höhle und der Umgebung nach dem Geosonar-Verfahren statt, einem Verfahren, bei dem über größere Strecken horizontale Messungen durchgehend erfasst werden können.', 'Im Jahre 1978 wurden durch Bohrungen Hohlräume in unmittelbarer Nachbarschaft der Teufelshöhle entdeckt und mit Sondenkameras fotografiert. Sie wurden jedoch nicht zugänglich gemacht. Am 23. August 1983 wurde die Höhle mit der Umgebung erneut als Naturschutzgebiet ausgewiesen. Die Höhle wird beim Hessischen Ministerium für Umwelt, Klimaschutz, Landwirtschaft und Verbraucherschutz mit einer eingeschlossenen Fläche von 15 Hektar, der Bezeichnung \\"Teufelsloch bei Steinau an der Straße\\" und der Nummer \\"435-012\\" geführt. Im Jahre 1998 begann die Erschließung eines weiteren Hohlraumes, der bei Führungen mit begangen wird. Seit einigen Jahren gibt es Überlegungen, den Außenbereich der Höhle zu modernisieren und eine Toilettenanlage einzurichten. Dieses Vorhaben scheiterte jedoch bisher aufgrund von Naturschutzauflagen. Im Juli 2010 ist die vor der Höhle gelegene Hütte komplett abgebrannt, wobei Brandstiftung nicht ganz ausgeschlossen wird. Im Herbst 2011 sollte eine neue Hütte mit einem geschlossenen Raum für Höhlenbesucher und einer behindertengerechten Toilettenanlage gebaut werden. Im Sommer 2012 bestand allerdings noch ein Provisorium. Im gleichen Jahr wurde eine seit 2009 geplante neue Beleuchtungsanlage auf Leuchtdioden-Basis, die auch die Lampenflora reduziert, sowie eine Beschallungsanlage im Dom installiert.', 'Geologie.', 'Entstehung.', 'Die Teufelshöhle liegt im etwa 230 bis 250 Millionen Jahre alten unteren Muschelkalk einer Karstlandschaft und wurde vor etwa 2,5 Millionen Jahren gebildet. Höhlen sind im Spessart sehr selten, da dort überwiegend roter Sandstein und Basalt vorkommen. In Hessen ist sie eine von drei Schauhöhlen und neben dem 2009 eröffneten Herbstlabyrinth eine der beiden Tropfsteinhöhlen. Zuflüsse von kalkgesättigten Gewässern (unter anderem des Ulmbaches) sind bei der Bildung der Höhle aus den hängenden basaltischen Gesteinen durch feine Risse und Klüfte eingedrungen. Durch die Auflösung des Kalkes durch Kohlensäure bildeten sich Tropfsteine und durch Strudelbildung unterirdischer Wasserläufe Hohlräume wie etwa der \\"Große Dom\\". Ausschlaggebend für die Bildung der Höhle war das Vorhandensein von wasserdurchlässigen und undurchlässigen Gesteinsschichten im Boden.', 'Beschreibung.', 'In der Höhle herrscht ständig eine Temperatur von etwa acht bis neun Grad Celsius bei einer Luftfeuchtigkeit von über 80 Prozent. Zu erreichen ist das Höhlensystem über einen 54 Meter langen, künstlich geschaffenen Stollen, der als Höhlenein- und -ausgang dient und sich auf einer Höhe von 272,6 Metern über Normalnull befindet. Die Höhle besteht aus drei größeren Räumen, die durch teilweise enge Gänge miteinander verbunden sind. Der Stollen ist im vorderen Teil mit Wellblech ausgekleidet. An seinem Ende befindet sich der 1584 entdeckte \\"Große Dom\\", der größte Raum der Höhle. Er ist 16 Meter hoch und hat einen nahezu kreisrunden Grundriss mit einem Durchmesser von etwa elf Metern. Nach oben ist er durch einen Schacht, das ehemalige \\"Teufelsloch\\", mit der Außenwelt verbunden, wodurch teilweise Sonnenlicht in die Höhle fällt. Der Raum war ursprünglich 25 Meter hoch. Die unteren neun Meter bestehen aus eingebrachtem Material. Entstanden ist die Rundung der Höhle durch die Strudelwirkung von zwei Wasseradern, die den Hohlraum ausfrästen. Ihre Einmündungen sind noch zu sehen. Das Wasser vergrößerte die Höhle immer mehr. Die Decke wurde schließlich so dünn, dass vor etwa 400 Jahren eine weidende Kuh einbrach. Im Großen Dom gibt es aufgrund der Luftzufuhr keine Tropfsteingebilde. Die Wände des Raumes bestehen teilweise aus hellen, glänzenden Überzügen aus Kalksinter.

Mangan ist ein silberweißes, hartes, sehr sprödes Übergangsmetall, das in manchen Eigenschaften dem Eisen ähnelt.', 'Mangan kommt in der Natur vorwiegend als Braunstein vor und wird in großen Mengen abgebaut. 90 % des abgebauten Mangans werden in der Stahlindustrie in Form von Ferromangan als Legierungsbestandteil von Stahl eingesetzt. Dabei entzieht es dem Stahl Sauerstoff und Schwefel und verbessert gleichzeitig die Durchhärtung. Wirtschaftlich wichtig ist zudem Mangan(IV)-oxid, das als Kathode in Alkali-Mangan-Batterien eingesetzt wird.', 'Das Element besitzt eine hohe biologische Bedeutung als Bestandteil verschiedener Enzyme. So wirkt es an einer zentralen Stelle im Photosynthese-Zyklus, wo ein Mangan-Calcium-Cluster für die Reduktion von Wasser zu Sauerstoff verantwortlich ist.', 'Geschichte.', 'In der Natur vorkommende Manganoxide wie Braunstein sind schon lange als natürliche Pigmente bekannt und in Gebrauch. So wurden schwarze Manganoxid-Pigmente unter anderem in den etwa 17.000 Jahre alten Höhlenmalereien in den Höhlen von Ekain und Lascaux nachgewiesen. In der Glasherstellung werden Manganverbindungen seit dem vierten Jahrhundert vor Christus im Römischen Reich eingesetzt. Dabei hat das Mangan zwei Funktionen: Wird Braunstein eingesetzt, färbt dieser das Glas intensiv braun-violett. Wird dagegen dreiwertiges Manganoxid in eisenhaltige Gläser gegeben, entfärbt es diese, indem es das grünfärbende zweiwertige Eisen zum schwach gelben dreiwertigen oxidiert, was zusammen mit dem Violett des Mangans ein graues „entfärbtes“ Aussehen ergibt.', 'Die erste Gewinnung des Elements gelang wahrscheinlich 1770 Ignatius Gottfried Kaim (1746–1778), der Braunstein mit Kohlenstoff reduzierte und dabei unreines Mangan erhielt, das er \\"Braunsteinkönig\\" nannte. Diese Entdeckung ist jedoch nicht sehr bekannt geworden. 1774 erkannte Carl Wilhelm Scheele, dass Braunstein ein unbekanntes Element enthalten müsse, im gleichen Jahr stellte Johan Gottlieb Gahn auf Scheeles Anregung hin Mangan durch Reduktion von Braunstein mit Kohlenstoff her. Als Name wurde nach der lateinischen Bezeichnung für Braunstein \\"manganesia nigra\\" zunächst \\"Manganesium\\" gewählt, nach der Entdeckung des Magnesiums jedoch wegen möglicher Verwechslungen zu \\"Mangan(ium)\\" abgekürzt. Braunstein wurde von Plinius wegen der Ähnlichkeit zum Magneteisen (oder \\"magnes masculini sexus\\") als \\"magnes feminei sexus\\" (da Braunstein nicht magnetisch ist) bezeichnet, was im Mittelalter zu \\"manganesia\\" wurde.', '1839 wurde erkannt, dass Mangan die Formbarkeit von Eisen verbessert. Als 1856 Robert Forester Mushet (1811–1891) zeigte, dass durch Zusatz von Mangan eine Massenproduktion von Stahl im Bessemer-Verfahren möglich ist, wurde Mangan in kurzer Zeit in großen Mengen zur Stahlproduktion verwendet. Auch Braunstein erlangte ab 1866 technische Bedeutung, als Walter Weldon das Weldon-Verfahren zur Chlorherstellung entwickelt hatte, bei dem Salzsäure mithilfe von Braunstein zu Chlor oxidiert wird.', 'Vorkommen.', 'Mangan ist auf der Erde ein häufiges Element, in der kontinentalen Erdkruste kommt es mit einem Gehalt von 0,095 % ähnlich häufig wie Phosphor oder Fluor vor. Nach Eisen und Titan ist es das dritthäufigste Übergangsmetall. Dabei kommt es nicht elementar, sondern stets in Verbindungen vor. Neben Mangansilikaten und Mangancarbonat ist es vor allem in Oxiden gebunden. Häufige Minerale sind die Mineralgruppe der Braunsteine, Manganit, Hausmannit, Braunit, Rhodochrosit und Rhodonit. Mangan kommt dabei in unterschiedlichen Oxidationsstufen zwei-, drei- und vierwertig vor, mitunter, wie im Hausmannit, auch in einem einzigen Mineral.', 'Während viele Verbindungen des zweiwertigen Mangans leicht wasserlöslich sind, sind Verbindungen in höheren Oxidationsstufen meist schwerlöslich und auch physikalisch und chemisch stabil. Darum bilden sich Manganerze vor allem unter oxidativen Bedingungen. Obwohl sich Eisen ähnlich wie Mangan verhält und ebenfalls unter oxidativen Bedingungen vom leichtlöslichen zweiwertigen zum schwerlöslichen dreiwertigen Eisen oxidiert, gibt es nur wenige Eisen-Mangan-Mischerze. Verantwortlich hierfür ist, dass Mangan sehr viel höhere Sauerstoffkonzentrationen für die Oxidation benötigt als Eisen.', 'Abbauwürdige Manganerze lassen sich geologisch in drei Gruppen einteilen. Der erste Typ sind Rhodochrosit-Braunit-Erze, die in präkambrischen vulkanischen Gesteinen eingeschlossen sind. Diese Erze finden sich vorwiegend um den südlichen Atlantik, etwa in Brasilien, Guyana, der Elfenbeinküste, Ghana, Burkina Faso oder im Kongo. Erze des zweiten Typs finden sich in stark oxidierten, eisen- und silikatreichen Sedimentgesteinen aus dem Proterozoikum. Die Vorkommen dieses Typs bei Hotazel in Südafrika und Corumbá in Brasilien zählen zu den größten Manganvorkommen auf der Welt. Zum dritten Typ zählen Mangan-Schiefer-Erze, die durch Sedimentation in flachen Schelfmeeren entstanden sind. Zu diesem Typ zählen unter anderem Vorkommen in Gabun, der Ukraine und weiteren Ländern um das Schwarze Meer.', 'Etwa 75 % der bekannten Ressourcen an Mangan liegen in der Kalahari Südafrikas. Auch in der Ukraine, Brasilien, Australien, Indien, Gabun und China finden sich größere Manganvorkommen. Größte Manganförderstaaten sind Südafrika, Australien, Gabun, China und Brasilien, wobei die Weltgesamtförderung 2010 bei 18,9 Millionen Tonnen lag. 2020 wurde ein größeres Vorkommen in New Brunswick in Kanada entdeckt, das auf 194 Millionen Tonnen geschätzt wird.', 'In größeren Mengen kommt Mangan in Manganknollen vor, knollenförmigen, bis zu 20 Zentimeter großen, porösen Konkretionen von Schwermetalloxiden in der Tiefsee, die bis zu 50 % aus Mangan bestehen können. Besonders hohe Konzentrationen an Manganknollen finden sich im Pazifik südlich von Hawaii sowie im Indischen Ozean. Deren Abbau, vor allem zur Gewinnung von Kupfer, Cobalt und Nickel, wurde zeitweise intensiv untersucht, scheiterte bislang jedoch an hohen technischen Anforderungen und hohen Abbaukosten bei gleichzeitig vergleichsweise niedrigen Preisen für an Land abgebaute Metalle.', 'Einen Überblick über die globalen Abbaumengen gibt folgende Tabelle:', 'Gewinnung und Darstellung.', 'Abbauwürdige Manganerze enthalten mindestens 35 % Mangan. Je nach Gehalt und enthaltenen anderen Elementen werden die Erze für verschiedene Anwendungen bevorzugt genutzt. Metallurgisch genutztes Manganerz enthält zwischen 38 und 55 % Mangan und wird im Tagebau oder im Kammerbau-Verfahren unter Tage abgebaut. Daneben gibt es \\"battery-grade\\"-Erz, das mindestens 44 % Mangan enthält sowie nur einen geringen Anteil an Kupfer, Nickel und Cobalt enthalten darf, damit es für die Produktion von Alkali-Mangan-Batterien geeignet ist, sowie \\"chemical-grade\\"-Erz, das für die Produktion von reinem Mangan und Manganverbindungen verwendet wird.', 'Für einen Großteil der Anwendungen wird kein reines Mangan benötigt. Stattdessen wird Ferromangan, eine Eisen-Mangan-Legierung mit 78 % Mangan, gewonnen. Dieses wird durch Reduktion oxidischer Mangan- und Eisenerze mit Koks in einem elektrischen Ofen hergestellt. Eine weitere Legierung, die auf diesem Weg hergestellt wird, ist die Mangan-Eisen-Silicium-Legierung Silicomangan. Hier wird zusätzlich Quarz als Siliciumquelle in den Ofen eingebracht.', 'Reines Mangan kann technisch nicht durch die Reduktion mit Kohlenstoff gewonnen werden, da sich hierbei neben Mangan auch stabile Carbide, insbesondere Mn7C3, bilden. Erst bei Temperaturen über 1600 °C entsteht reines Mangan, bei dieser Temperatur verdampft jedoch schon ein Teil des Mangans, so dass dieser Weg nicht wirtschaftlich ist. Stattdessen wird Mangan durch Hydrometallurgie gewonnen. Hierbei wird Manganerz oxidiert, gelaugt und einer Elektrolyse unterzogen. Bei letzterer wird eine möglichst reine Mangansulfat-Lösung verwendet, die mit Edelstahl-Elektroden bei 5–7 V elektrolysiert wird. An der Kathode entsteht dabei reines Mangan, an der Anode Sauerstoff, der mit Manganionen weiter zu Braunstein reagiert.', 'Zur Verringerung des Energieverbrauchs werden dem Elektrolyt kleinere Mengen Schwefel- oder Selendioxid beigesetzt.', 'Daneben sind auch die Gewinnung von Mangan durch die Reduktion von Manganoxiden mit Aluminium (Aluminothermie) oder Silicium möglich.', 'Eigenschaften.', 'Physikalische Eigenschaften.', 'Mangan ist ein silberweißes, hartes, sehr sprödes Schwermetall.

Insgesamt sind vier verschiedene Modifikationen bekannt, die bei unterschiedlichen Temperaturen stabil sind. Bei Raumtemperatur ist Mangan paramagnetisch, die α-Modifikation wird unter einer Néel-Temperatur von 100 K antiferromagnetisch, während β-Mangan kein solches Verhalten zeigt.', 'Bis zu einer Temperatur von 727 °C ist die α-Mangan-Struktur thermodynamisch stabil.

Das Verständnis der Qualia ist eines der zentralen Probleme der Philosophie des Geistes. Dort wird von manchen angenommen, dass ihre Existenz nicht mit den Mitteln der Neuro- und Kognitionswissenschaften erklärbar ist.', 'Im Jahr 1866 führte der Amerikaner Charles S. Peirce den Begriff der \\"Qualia\\" systematisch in die Philosophie ein, auch wenn der Begriff z. B. schon rund dreißig Jahre früher bei Heinrich Moritz Chalybäus unter Bezugnahme auf die Philosophie Johann Friedrich Herbarts Erwähnung fand.', 'Doch erst 1929 bestimmte C. I. Lewis in dem Buch \\"Mind and the World Order\\" die \\"Qualia\\" im Sinne der aktuellen Philosophie des Geistes als „erkennbare Charaktere des Gegebenen, die wiedererkannt werden können, und deshalb eine Art Universalien sind“. Ein in der Literatur häufig anzutreffendes Synonym für den Begriff der Qualia ist der englische Ausdruck \\"raw feels\\".', 'Begriffsbestimmung.', 'Unter „Qualia“ wird der \\"subjektive\\" Erlebnisgehalt mentaler Zustände verstanden. Doch gerade ein solches subjektives Element scheint sich jeder \\"intersubjektiven\\" Begriffsbestimmung zu widersetzen. Der Philosoph Thomas Nagel hat zur Bestimmung der Qualia die Redeweise geprägt, dass es sich, in einem mentalen Zustand zu sein (\\"what is it like\\"). Wenn eine Person etwa friert, so hat dies in der Regel verschiedene Konsequenzen. In der Person laufen etwa verschiedene neuronale Prozesse ab und die Person wird ein bestimmtes Verhalten zeigen. Doch das ist nicht alles: „Es fühlt sich für die Person auch auf eine bestimmte Weise an“, zu frieren. Allerdings kann Nagels Bestimmungsversuch nicht als allgemeine Definition gelten. Eine Bestimmung von Qualia durch die Phrase „sich auf bestimmte Weise anfühlen“ setzt voraus, dass diese Phrase schon verstanden ist. Wem jedoch die Rede von subjektiven Erlebnisgehalten nicht einleuchtet, der wird die Phrase auch nicht verstehen. Ned Block hat das Problem der Begriffsbestimmung daher wie folgt kommentiert:', 'Die Probleme, die bei der Bestimmung von Qualia auftreten, haben einige Philosophen wie Daniel Dennett, Patricia und Paul Churchland dazu veranlasst, Qualia als gänzlich unbrauchbare Begriffe abzulehnen und stattdessen einen Qualiaeliminativismus zu vertreten. Ansgar Beckermann kommentiert hingegen:', 'Das Rätsel der Qualia.', 'Auch wenn die explizite Diskussion der Qualia erst im 20. Jahrhundert aufkam, ist das Problem der Sache nach schon weit länger bekannt: Schon bei René Descartes, John Locke und David Hume lassen sich ähnliche, wenn auch nicht weiter ausgeführte Gedankengänge dieser Art finden. Hume beispielsweise behauptete in seinem \\"Treatise on Human Nature\\" (1739):', 'Auch Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz formulierte das Qualiaproblem in einem eindringlichen Gedankenexperiment. Leibniz lässt uns durch ein gigantisches Modell des Gehirns laufen. Ein solches Modell wird darüber informieren, wie im Gehirn Reize auf eine sehr komplexe Art und Weise verarbeitet werden und schließlich mittels Erregungsweiterleitung in verschiedenen Körperteilen zu einer Reaktion führen (vgl. Reiz-Reaktions-Modell). Aber, so Leibniz, nirgendwo werden wir in diesem Modell das Bewusstsein entdecken. Eine neurowissenschaftliche Beschreibung werde uns also über das Bewusstsein vollkommen im Dunkeln lassen. In Leibniz’ Gedankenexperiment kann man leicht das Qualiaproblem entdecken. Denn zu dem, was man in dem Gehirnmodell nicht entdecken kann, gehören ganz offensichtlich auch die Qualia. Das Modell mag uns etwa darüber aufklären, wie eine Lichtwelle auf die Netzhaut trifft, dadurch Signale ins Gehirn geleitet und dort schließlich verarbeitet werden. Es wird uns nach Leibniz’ Ansicht jedoch nicht darüber aufklären, warum die Person eine Rotwahrnehmung hat. Leibniz hat das Leib-Seele-Problem, das sich mit dem Begriff der Qualia näher beschreiben lässt, seinerseits mit dem Begriff der petites perceptions zu erfassen versucht.', 'Eine weitere frühe Formulierung des Qualiaproblems geht auf den Physiologen Emil du Bois-Reymond und seine Ignorabimusrede zurück. In seinem 1872 auf der Naturforscherversammlung in Leipzig gehaltenen Vortrag \\"Über die Grenzen des Naturerkennens\\" erklärt du Bois-Reymond die Frage nach dem Bewusstsein zu einem Welträtsel:', 'Die gegenwärtige Debatte um Qualia fußt vor allem auf dem Aufsatz \\"What is it like to be a bat?\\" („Wie fühlt es sich an, eine Fledermaus zu sein?“) des Philosophen Thomas Nagel im Oktober 1974. Nagels Aufsatz fiel in eine Zeit, in der die Philosophie des Geistes durch die Entwicklungen der Neuro- und Kognitionswissenschaften überwiegend reduktionistisch geprägt war. Er argumentiert nun, dass die Naturwissenschaften das Phänomen des Erlebens gar nicht erklären könnten. Schließlich seien die Wissenschaften in ihrer Methode auf eine \\"Außenperspektive\\" festgelegt, in der sich die \\"Innenperspektive\\" des Erlebens gar nicht fassen lasse. Nagel versucht seine Position mit einem berühmt gewordenen Beispiel zu illustrieren. Er fordert dazu auf, sich eine Fledermaus vorzustellen. Nun können wir, so argumentiert Nagel, bei so fremden Lebewesen zwar viele neurowissenschaftliche und ethologische Experimente durchführen und dabei auch einiges über die kognitiven Fähigkeiten einer Fledermaus herausfinden. Wie es sich jedoch für die Fledermaus anfühlt, etwa ein Objekt mittels Echoortung zu lokalisieren, bleibe uns verschlossen. Nagel schließt aus diesem Beispiel, dass die subjektive Perspektive der Qualia nicht durch die objektive Perspektive der Naturwissenschaften zu erschließen sei.', 'Qualia-Argumente.', 'Zusätzlich zu dem allgemein formulierten Qualiaproblem wurden immer wieder Argumente zur Stützung des Qualia-Konzeptes formuliert. Einige haben das Ziel, das Problem genauer zu bestimmen. Andere wollen aus ihm Konsequenzen ziehen, etwa eine Kritik des Materialismus.', 'Das Mary-Gedankenexperiment.', 'Das berühmteste gegen den Materialismus gerichtete qualiabasierte Argument kommt von dem australischen Philosophen Frank Cameron Jackson. In seinem Aufsatz \\"What Mary didn’t know\\" („Was Mary nicht wusste“) formuliert Jackson das Gedankenexperiment der Superwissenschaftlerin Mary. Mary ist eine auf Farbensehen spezialisierte Physiologin, die seit ihrer Geburt in einem schwarz-weißen Labor gefangen ist und noch nie Farben gesehen hat. Sie kennt alle physischen Fakten über das Sehen von Farben, weiß jedoch nicht, wie Farben aussehen. Jacksons Argument gegen den Materialismus ist nun recht kurz: Mary kennt alle physischen Fakten über das Sehen von Farben – sie kennt dennoch nicht \\"alle\\" Fakten über das Sehen von Farben. Er schließt daraus, dass es nicht-physische Fakten gebe und der Materialismus falsch sei.', 'Gegen dieses Argument sind verschiedene materialistische Erwiderungen vorgebracht worden. David Lewis argumentiert, dass Mary keine neuen Fakten kennenlernt, wenn sie erstmals Farben sieht. Vielmehr würde sie allein eine neue Fähigkeit erwerben – die Fähigkeit, Farben visuell zu unterscheiden. Michael Tye argumentiert ebenfalls, dass Mary vor ihrer Befreiung alle Fakten über das Sehen von Farben kennen würde. Mary würde lediglich einen schon bekannten Fakt auf eine neue Weise kennenlernen. Daniel Dennett erklärt schließlich sogar, dass es für Mary gar nichts Neues gäbe, wenn sie Farben zum ersten Mal visuell wahrnimmt. Ein so umfassendes physiologisches Wissen über das Sehen von Farben – sie weiß \\"alles\\" – würde sie mit allen Informationen ausstatten.', 'Fehlende und invertierte Qualia.', 'Auch mit den Gedankenexperimenten der fehlenden und invertierten Qualia ist der Anspruch verbunden, die Rätselhaftigkeit der Qualia nachzuweisen. Diese Gedankenexperimente fußen auf der Tatsache, dass der Übergang von neuronalen Zuständen zu Erlebniszuständen keineswegs offensichtlich ist. Ein Beispiel (siehe Grafik): Ein neuronaler Zustand A geht mit einer Rotwahrnehmung, ein Zustand B mit einer Blauwahrnehmung einher. Nun sagt das Gedankenexperiment der invertierten Qualia, dass es auch vorstellbar sei, dass dies genau umgekehrt ablaufe: \\"Derselbe\\" neuronale Zustand A könne auch mit einer Blauwahrnehmung, \\"derselbe\\" neuronale Zustand B mit einer Rotwahrnehmung einhergehen.', 'Das Gedankenexperiment der fehlenden Qualia behauptet darüber hinaus, dass es sogar vorstellbar sei, dass einem neuronalen Zustand \\"gar keine\\" Qualia gegenüberstehen. Die Idee der fehlenden Qualia läuft daher auf die Hypothese der „philosophischen Zombies“ hinaus: Es sei vorstellbar, dass Wesen die gleichen neuronalen Zustände wie andere Menschen haben und sich daher auch im Verhalten nicht von diesen unterscheiden. Dennoch hätten sie in Bezug auf den betrachteten neuronalen Zustand kein Erleben, den neuronalen Zuständen korrelierten also keine Qualia.', 'Hinsichtlich der Motive für diese Gedankenexperimente muss man zwischen zwei verschiedenen Lesarten – einer erkenntnistheoretischen und einer metaphysischen – unterscheiden. Philosophen, welche die erkenntnistheoretische Lesart bevorzugen, wollen mit den Gedankenexperimenten zeigen, dass sich Qualia noch nicht auf neuronale Zustände reduzieren lassen. Sie argumentieren, dass die Vorstellbarkeit des Auseinandertretens von neuronalem Zustand und Qualia zeige, dass wir die Verbindung zwischen beiden nicht verstanden haben. Hier wird oft das Wasserbeispiel bemüht: Wenn Wasser erfolgreich auf H2O reduziert worden ist, sei es nicht mehr vorstellbar, dass H2O vorliege, ohne dass zugleich Wasser vorliege. Dies sei einfach deshalb nicht vorstellbar, weil das Vorliegen von Wasser unter den Gegebenheiten der Chemie und der Physik aus dem Vorliegen von H2O ableitbar ist. Nur deshalb könne man sagen, dass Wasser auf H2O reduziert worden sei. Ein Äquivalent der chemisch-physikalischen Theorie, die dieser erfolgreichen Reduktion zugrunde liegt, fehlt jedoch im Bereich der neuronalen und mentalen Phänomene.', 'Die metaphysische Lesart der Konzepte der invertierten und fehlenden Qualia haben hingegen noch weiter reichende Folgen. Vertreter dieser Argumentationsrichtung wollen mit den Gedankenexperimenten beweisen, dass Qualia nicht mit Eigenschaften von neuronalen Zuständen identisch sind. Sie haben damit letztlich eine Widerlegung des Materialismus im Sinn. Sie argumentieren wie folgt: Wenn X und Y identisch sind, dann ist es nicht möglich, dass X vorliegt, oh: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Qualia, phänomenales Bewusstsein, subjektiv, intersubjektiv, Thomas Nagel, Qualiaeliminativismus, Leib-Seele-Problem, Mary-Gedankenexperiment, fehlende Qualia, invertierte Qualia"},{"prompt":"how to modify rip settings for a cd xbox 360","completion":"As an AI language model, I don't have hands-on experience on modifying the rip settings for a CD on an Xbox 360, but here are the general steps: 1.

Jahrhunderts zum spanischen Einflussbereich. 1884 gründete eine private Gesellschaft als erste Siedlung an der Küste den Handelsposten Villa Cisneros (heute Ad-Dakhla). Im Juni 1900 legten Spanien und Frankreich die Grenzen für die Kolonie Río de Oro im Süden der heutigen Westsahara fest.

Durch den Nachweis der elektromagnetischen Verträglichkeit von Rechner und HF-Modulator gegenüber der FCC gelangte der TI-99/4A schließlich im Sommer 1981 zur Marktreife.', 'Vermarktung und Preisentwicklung.', 'Anders als im Fall der meist in den Billiglohnländern Südostasiens hergestellten, weltweit erfolgreichen Heimcomputer von Commodore und Atari blieb eine nennenswerte Verbreitung des in den texanischen Städten Lubbock, Abilene und Austin, im niederländischen Almelo sowie italienischen Rieti gefertigten TI-99/4A auf Nordamerika, Großbritannien, Westdeutschland, Frankreich, Italien und die Niederlande beschränkt. TI verfügte bei Markteinführung über bereits etablierte Vertriebsstrukturen in den Vereinigten Staaten und der TI-99/4A war sowohl in eigenen Filialen als auch unabhängigen Fachgeschäften, Kaufhäusern und Supermärkten erhältlich. Alternativ konnte der Rechner über den Versandhandel direkt ab Werk bezogen werden.', 'Anfängliche Verkaufserfolge und Marktführerschaft.', 'Für einen TI-99/4A mussten die Zwischenhändler im Sommer 1981 ca. 340 USD bezahlen, während der tatsächliche Verkaufspreis mit 550 USD anfänglich etwas höher ausfiel als die unverbindliche Preisempfehlung von 525 USD. Die Wochenproduktion belief sich zu diesem Zeitpunkt auf knapp 8.000 Einheiten. Auf der Grundlage optimistischer Verkaufsprognosen veranlasste Vertriebsleiter William J. Turner bis Ende 1981 eine schrittweise Absenkung des Listenpreises auf zunächst 450 USD, dann 375 USD. Die Gewinnmarge konnte dabei durch Verringerung der Produktionskosten auf einem stabilen Niveau von 40 Prozent pro Rechner gehalten werden.', 'Im Februar 1982 musste TI den TI-99/4A wegen schadhafter Netzteile vorübergehend vom Markt nehmen. Dem Konzern entstanden daraus finanzielle Schäden in Höhe von 50 Millionen USD. Zur Überwindung dieser Krise, d. h. zur Ankurbelung der Verkäufe, setzte Turner auf eine aggressivere Vermarktung und senkte daraufhin den Preis auf 300 USD, begleitet von einer Werbekampagne mit dem Slogan \\"„TI's Home Computer. This is the one“\\", für die der bekannte Komiker Bill Cosby verpflichtet und mit 1 Million USD pro Jahr entlohnt wurde. Auf Geheiß des im August 1982 zum Direktor der Abteilung für Unterhaltungselektronik beförderten Turner trat TI in einen offenen Preiskrieg mit dem Hauptkonkurrenten Commodore und dessen Heimcomputer VC20 ein. Turner hoffte dabei zu Recht auf Großbestellungen der wichtigsten Handelsketten wie J.C. Penney, Sears Roebuck, K-Mart oder Toys “R” Us. Rabatte von 100 USD verringerten den effektiven Verkaufspreis am 1. September 1982 auf unter 200 USD und nährten das Gerücht, TI sitze auf Lagerbeständen von bis zu 50.000 unverkauften Einheiten. TI-Werbepartner Cosby scherzte mit Blick auf diese Rabattaktionen für den TI-99/4A in der Öffentlichkeit darüber, wie einfach das Verkaufen eines Heimcomputers sei, wenn man den Kunden nur eine Belohnung von 100 USD dafür zahle.', 'Turners aggressive Marketingstrategie führte im Herbst 1982 zu einer deutlichen Vergrößerung der Nachfrage und Ausweitung der Produktion. Auf jeden verkauften VC20 kamen zu diesem Zeitpunkt drei Exemplare des technisch überlegenen TI-99/4A. Die Monatsproduktion belief sich zwischen Juli und Dezember 1982 auf ca. 150.000 Einheiten, während das Vertriebsnetz nunmehr 12.000 Verkaufsstellen umfasste. Zu Spitzenzeiten wurden bis zu 5.000 Einheiten pro Tag hergestellt. Eine weitere Verminderung der Produktionskosten gelang allerdings nicht und die Gewinne pro verkauftem Rechner gingen um 50 Prozent zurück. Der Umsatz der Abteilung für Unterhaltungselektronik wuchs auf 200 Millionen USD und hatte sich damit innerhalb kurzer Zeit verzehnfacht. Insgesamt wurden 1982 rund 500.000 Exemplare abgesetzt. Mit 575.000 Benutzern und damit einem Marktanteil von rund 35 Prozent galt der TI-99/4A zum Jahreswechsel 1982/83 als der am weitesten verbreitete Heimcomputer in den Vereinigten Staaten.', 'Auch im folgenden Jahr blieb die Nachfrage zunächst hoch. Wöchentlich rund 30.000 Einheiten wurden allein im Januar 1983 abgesetzt. Die Bestellungen der Händler blieben ebenfalls auf hohem Niveau. Im April 1983 erreichte die Zahl der verkauften Einheiten die Millionengrenze. In Europa jedoch konnte an diesen Erfolg nicht angeknüpft werden; in Westdeutschland gelang es TI, bis Ende 1983 ledig: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"1.

Daneben enthalten sie Kupfer, Cobalt, Nickel sowie andere Metalle. Sie kommen in weiten Teilen der Tiefsee zwischen etwa 3000 und 6000 Metern auf den Sedimenten des Meeresbodens vor. Die größten Vorkommen befinden sich im Pazifischen Ozean, wo mehrere Milliarden Tonnen Mangan und Eisen sowie große Mengen anderer Metalle in Form von Manganknollen lagern.', 'Die Größe der Knollen variiert von kleinen Partikeln bis hin zu größeren Gebilden mit einem Durchmesser von einigen Zentimetern. Ihre Gestalt ist kugel- bis diskusförmig oder sie treten in unregelmäßigen Formen auf. Die Manganknollen der Tiefsee wachsen, von Ausnahmen abgesehen, mit einer Geschwindigkeit von einigen Millimetern pro einer Million Jahre. Aus ihrem Aufbau und ihrer Zusammensetzung lassen sich verschiedene Aspekte des erdgeschichtlichen Klimas und der Meereschemie über Millionen Jahre nachvollziehen.', 'Der Meeresboden der Tiefsee, der mehr als die Hälfte der Erdoberfläche bedeckt, ist das größte Ökosystem der Erde, das zu den artenreichsten Lebensräumen zählt. In Tiefseeregionen mit Manganknollenvorkommen schaffen diese ein Lebensumfeld mit einer großen Artenvielfalt. Manganknollen stellen Lebensräume für Mikroorganismen, Würmer, Krebstiere, Mollusken und andere wirbellose ortsgebundene Tiere. Verschiedene meiofaunale Gruppen von Lebewesen kommen nur auf den Knollen vor. Auf den Manganknollen lebende Mikroorganismen bauen abgestorbenes pflanzliches und tierisches Material ab, das zum Meeresboden absinkt. Die von ihnen produzierte Biomasse bildet die Basis der dortigen Nahrungskette und leistet einen wichtigen Beitrag für die Lebensgemeinschaft der Tiefsee. Doch die niedrigen Temperaturen und das eingeschränkte Nahrungsangebot führen zu einer niedrigen Stoffwechselrate. Infolgedessen wachsen die Organismen, die sie bewohnen, nur langsam und ihre Reproduktionsrate ist niedrig.', 'Die Manganknollen, die zunächst als ein wissenschaftliches Kuriosum betrachtet wurden, stellen eine potentielle Quelle für Erze von Cobalt, Nickel, Kupfer, Metalle der Seltenen Erden und andere Metalle dar. Die ersten Projekte zur Gewinnung der Knollen auf dem Meeresboden sowie deren Verarbeitung begannen in den 1960er Jahren. Aufgrund wirtschaftlicher und rechtlicher Überlegungen sowie ungeklärter technischer und ökologischer Fragen stellten die meisten Firmen die kommerziellen Projekte in den 1980er Jahren wieder ein. Die Nachfrage nach Metallen wächst jedoch stetig, und Deutschland ist beispielsweise bei der Produktion von Elektroautos, Windkraftanlagen oder Akkumulatoren auf Basis von Lithium, Cobalt oder Nickel fast vollständig auf die Einfuhr dieser Metalle angewiesen. Die hohe Nachfrage nach diesen Metallen in der Luft- und Raumfahrttechnik, der Umwelttechnik, der Medizintechnik und anderen Spitzentechnologien könnte zum Auslöser für neue Meeresbodenbergbauprojekte im 21. Jahrhundert werden.', 'Die Lizenzen für die Exploration und den Abbau der Manganknollen vergibt die Internationale Meeresbodenbehörde auf Grundlage des 1994 ratifizierten Seerechtsübereinkommens, in dem die Vereinten Nationen die Manganknollen zum Erbe der gesamten Menschheit erklärten. Jedoch sind die Ökosysteme der Tiefsee, eine der abgelegensten und am wenigsten erforschten Regionen der Erde, zum Teil bereits durch anthropogene Stressfaktoren vorbelastet.', 'Aufgrund der Befürchtung, dass der Meeresbodenbergbau diese Faktoren verstärken und zu einem unumkehrbaren Verlust an Biodiversität und Ökosystemfunktionen führen würde, empfahlen Experten im Jahr 2021 in einer \\"Wissenschaftlichen Erklärung zum Meeresbodenbergbau\\", alle Vorhaben zur Ausbeutung von Manganknollen auszusetzen. Deutschland hat im Rahmen der EU-Biodiversitätsstrategie 2030 die Position bezogen, dass Manganknollen erst dann abgebaut werden sollten, wenn die Auswirkungen des Abbaus hinreichend untersucht sind und nachgewiesen werden kann, dass die Meeresumwelt dadurch nicht gefährdet wird.', 'Abgrenzung zu anderen Meeresbodenmineralien.', 'Neben Manganknollen existieren noch andere Arten von metallhaltigen Ablagerungen in Meeren und Seen, die von Manganknollen abgegrenzt und unterschieden werden müssen. Einige der Bildungsprozesse für die anderen Mineralien des Meeresbodens basieren auf Prozessen, die ebenfalls für das Wachstum der Manganknollen entscheidend sind, andere basieren auf anderen Metallquellen und Wachstumsformen. Die Zusammensetzung der Meeresbodenmineralien kann in weiten Grenzen variieren und reicht von fast reinen Eisen- bis zu fast reinen Manganoxiden. Hydrogenetische Ferromangankrusten, die sich vorwiegend durch die Ausfällung von Mineralien aus kaltem Meerwasser bilden, haben in der Regel ein durchschnittliches Verhältnis von Mangan zu Eisen von 1,5 bis etwa 0,83; Manganknollen aus der Clarion-Clipperton-Zone liegen bei einem Mangan-zu-Eisen-Verhältnis von etwa 3,34, in anderen Teilen des Pazifiks kann das Verhältnis 1,5 betragen.', 'Ferromangankrusten.', 'Bei Ferromangankrusten, auch Mangan- oder Cobaltkrusten genannt, handelt es sich um Krusten metallhaltiger Verbindungen auf Felsen. Sie befinden sich in Tiefen von etwa 1000 bis 3000 Metern auf dem harten Gestein von Tiefseebergen, unterseeischen Aufschlüssen und sedimentarmen ozeanischen Plateaus. Ferromangankrusten bestehen oft nur aus hydrogenetischen Schichten. Die Krusten weisen einen hohen Anteil an Cobalt auf und sind fest mit dem Gesteinsuntergrund verbunden. Die Gewinnung der Ferromangankrusten ist mit einem erheblichen Energieaufwand verbunden. Sie treten häufig in Gebieten mit signifikanter vulkanischer Aktivität auf und liegen oft in den „Ausschließlichen Wirtschaftszonen“. Große Vorkommen befinden sich etwa im zentralen äquatorialen Pazifik, im äquatorialen Indischen Ozean und im Zentralen Atlantik.', 'Ferromangankonkretionen.', 'Ferromangankonkretionen kommen in flachen Meeresgebieten wie der Ostsee, dem Schwarzen Meer und in Süßwasserseen vor. Sie werden zum Teil als Manganknollen bezeichnet, obwohl sie sich in ihrer Wachstumsrate und Struktur von den Manganknollen der Tiefsee unterscheiden. Die im Süßwasser vorkommenden Konkretionen werden als Süßwasser-Manganknollen bezeichnet. Sie wachsen durch ähnliche Prozesse wie die Manganknollen der Tiefsee, jedoch wesentlich schneller. Ablagerungen von Süßwasser-Manganknollen finden sich beispielsweise im Michigansee sowie im Oneida Lake, einem großen, relativ flachen See im US-Bundesstaat New York. Der Grund für das schnelle Wachstum liegt im Mangangehalt des Porenwassers der Green Bay und des nördlichen Michigansees, der im Vergleich zum Seewasser um etwa das 2500 bis 4000-fache angereichert ist. Der hohe Mangangehalt der Flüsse, die in die Green Bay fließen, stammt möglicherweise aus den ausgedehnten Eisenerzlagerstätten im Norden und Westen des Lake Michigans.', 'Massivsulfide.', 'Massivsulfide sind Schwefelverbindungen, die sich in 500 bis 4000 Metern Tiefe in der Umgebung von heißen, mineralienreichen hydrothermalen Tiefseequellen abgelagert haben. Meerwasser, das an den Ozeanbodenspreizungen in die ozeanische Erdkruste eindringt, wird durch den dort herrschenden Druck und die Temperatur in ein hydrothermales Fluid mit niedrigem pH-Wert und hoher Temperatur umgewandelt. Dieses hydrothermale Fluid ist in der Lage, große Mengen an Metallsalzen aus dem Gestein zu lösen. Die Metallsulfide, die aus den hydrothermalen Fluiden ausgefällt werden, enthalten unter anderem hohe Konzentrationen von Kupfer, Zink und Edelmetallen. Die Größe der Vorkommen beträgt bis zu fünf Millionen Tonnen Metallsalze, die Gesamtvorkommen sind jedoch wesentlich kleiner als die der Manganknollen und Ferromangankrusten. Große Lagerstätten befinden sich im Roten Meer, dem zentralen und östlichen Manus-Becken vor Papua-Neuguinea sowie im Mittelozeanischen Rücken.', 'Tiefseeschlämme.', 'Größere Vorkommen an Tiefsee- oder Erzschlämmen bilden sich, wenn durch Klüfte und Risse im Meeresgrund Meerwasser in die Erdkruste dringt, in Magmakammern aufgeheizt wird und dabei große Mengen an Salzen löst. Wenn es als hydrothermales Fluid einige Hundert Meter unter der Sedimentoberfläche austritt und nach oben steigt und sich dabei mit kaltem Porenwasser vermischt, fallen dabei die gelösten Metallverbindungen aus und lagern sich im Sediment ab. Ein großes bekanntes Vorkommen namens „Atlantis II“ liegt im Roten Meer und umfasst etwa 90 Millionen Tonnen Metallerze. Tiefseeschlämme gelten als potentiell große Ressource für Metalle der Seltenen Erden sowie anderer Metalle. Die Konzentrationen der Metalloxide liegen im Bereich von 0,5 %, einzelne Fraktionen enthalten bis zu 2,2 % an Oxiden der Seltenen Erden.', 'Geschichte.', 'Challenger-Expedition.', 'Die Existenz von Manganknollen ist seit dem späten 19. Jahrhundert bekannt. Ihre Entdeckung erfolgte am 18. Februar 1873 während der Challenger-Expedition, einer britischen Forschungsreise, die wichtige Aufschlüsse über die geologische und zoologische Beschaffenheit des Ozeanbodens brachte. Berichte, dass Manganknollen bereits während der Sofia-Expedition 1868 gefunden wurden, erwiesen sich als falsch.', 'Der Leiter der Challenger-Expedition, Charles Wyville Thomson, beschrieb die wesentlichen Elemente der Knollenfunde 1876 folgendermaßen:', 'Bei folgenden Expeditionen, etwa 1878 bei der von Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld mit dem Schiff Vega durchgeführten Erstdurchquerung der Nordostpassage, wurden weitere Manganknollen gefördert und analysiert. John Murray, der als Begründer der Ozeanographie gilt, und der belgische Geologe Alphonse-François Renard beschrieben die Eigenschaften der bei der Challenger-Expedition gefundenen Manganknollen in einem umfangreichen Werk. Größere Aufmerksamkeit als die Manganknollen erregte jedoch die Vielzahl der während der Expedition gefundenen Pflanzen- und Tierexemplare. Die Manganknollen dagegen wurden fast ein Jahrhundert lang nicht weiter erforscht.', '20. Jahrhundert.', 'Eine intensivere Forschung in Bezug auf Manganknollen begann Mitte des 20. Jahrhunderts.

Jahrhundert)', 'Literatur (Englisch)', 'Mann'], 'Francis Quarles (* 8. Mai 1592 in Romford, England; † 8. September 1644 vermutlich in London) war ein englischer Dichter und Emblematiker. Gemessen an der Auflagenzahl seiner Werke, besonders der beiden beliebtesten, des Gedichtbandes \\"Emblemes\\" und der Aphorismensammlung \\"Enchyridion\\", gilt er seinem Biographen Karl Josef Höltgen zufolge als der „populärste englische Dichter des 17. Jahrhunderts“. Die Zeit seines Wirkens fällt größtenteils in die politisch und religiös unruhige Regierungszeit Karls I., mit dessen Politik und den daraus erwachsenden gesellschaftlichen Konsequenzen Quarles sich in seinen Werken kritisch auseinandersetzte.', 'Sein Werk umfasst verschiedene literarische Gattungen, sowohl Dichtung als auch Prosa. Inhaltlich beschäftigte Quarles sich vor allem mit religiösen Themen. Bereits in seinen frühen religiösen Dichtungen verwendete er an die antike Mythologie angelehnte Allegorien, um seine theologischen Anliegen auszudrücken. In seinen späteren Werken stellte er politische, gesellschaftliche und religiöse Missstände seiner Zeit oft satirisch dar und rief damit sowohl zur Hinwendung zu Gott als auch zur Überwindung der Spaltung der Gesellschaft auf. Zwar verteidigte er das Gottesgnadentum des Königs und stand somit den Royalisten politisch nahe, trat aber gleichzeitig für die religiösen und sozialen Anliegen der Puritaner ein. Seine Schriften waren daher bei Puritanern und Anhängern der anglikanischen Staatskirche gleichermaßen beliebt.', 'Als „Autor, der gerade die populären Stiltendenzen seiner Zeit in besonders charakteristischer Weise verkörperte“, galt er im Klassizismus und in der aufkommenden Aufklärung als „altmodischer Puritaner“. Für Alexander Pope war er gar der „Prototyp des schlechten Poeten“. Zwar wurden einige seiner Schriften, besonders die als Erbauungsbuch beliebten \\"Emblemes\\", noch bis ins 19. Jahrhundert hinein vielfach nachgedruckt und viel gelesen, mit der Ausbreitung des aufgeklärten Gedankenguts in großen Teilen der Gesellschaft und dem sich wandelnden Geschmack gerieten Quarles und seine Werke jedoch in Vergessenheit. Nur einzelne Gedichte wurden in Anthologien aufgenommen.', 'Leben.', 'Familie.', 'Quarles stammte aus einer dem niedrigen Adel zugehörigen Familie. Er wurde als dritter Sohn von insgesamt acht Kindern des Magisters und königlichen Marinebeamten James Quarles († 1599) und dessen Ehefrau Joan, geborene Dalton († 1606), in Romford (heute London Borough of Havering) in der Grafschaft Essex geboren und am 8. Mai 1592 getauft. Seine Mutter besaß ein Gut in Hertfordshire. Sie war eine überzeugte Puritanerin, die 1589 mit dem Gesetz in Konflikt geraten war, weil sie eine Dienerin ohne die vorgeschriebenen Zeremonien der anglikanischen Staatskirche hatte bestatten lassen.', 'Sein ältester Bruder Robert (1580–1639) erbte den Herrensitz der Mutter, war als Friedensrichter und Parlamentsabgeordneter tätig und wurde um 1607 von König Jakob I. zum Ritter geschlagen. Seine Schwester Priscilla heiratete 1605 Baronet John Dryden, den Onkel des gleichnamigen Dichters, starb aber nicht lange danach. Dryden war ab 1640 Mitglied im Langen Parlament, ebenso wie der Sohn von Quarles’ Patenonkel Sir Francis Barrington, Thomas Barrington, mit dem Quarles zeitlebens ein gutes Verhältnis pflegte.', 'Jugend und erste Schaffensjahre.', 'Ausgestattet mit Legaten aus dem Erbe seiner Eltern studierte der früh verwaiste Francis Quarles von 1605 bis zu seiner Graduierung im Januar 1609 zusammen mit seinem älteren Bruder James am Christ’s College der Universität Cambridge, dessen Lehre von Puritanismus und Ramismus geprägt war. Am 25. Juni 1610 trat er, wiederum zusammen mit James, in Lincoln’s Inn in London ein, wo er zusammen mit anderen Gentlemen eine juristische Ausbildung genoss, vor allem aber kulturelle und literarische Anregungen erhielt. Nach der Hochzeit der Prinzessin Elisabeth Stuart mit Kurfürst Friedrich V. von der Pfalz begleitete er die junge Ehefrau im Frühjahr 1613 im Gefolge des königlichen Gesandten Thomas Howard, 21. Earl of Arundel, nach Heidelberg. Während Arundel eine Reise durch Europa anschloss, kehrte Quarles zusammen mit Robert Sidney und anderen Adligen im Sommer 1613 zurück. Sidney widmete er 1620 sein erstes Buch \\"A Feast for Wormes\\". Möglicherweise war er es, der ihn ermutigte eine literarische Laufbahn einzuschlagen. Dafür spricht auch, dass Quarles für seine Versromanze \\"Argalus and Parthenia\\" als Vorbild \\"Arcadia\\" von Philip Sidney, dem 1586 jung verstorbenen Bruder des Earls von Leicester, wählte.', 'Wie Quarles die folgenden Jahre verbrachte, ist nicht bekannt. Ob er die 1615 erteilte Erlaubnis zu einer weiteren Auslandsreise nutzte, ist unsicher, denn sein Werk erlaubt keine Rückschlüsse auf Reiseerfahrungen.', 'Nachdem Quarles 1617 ein Haus im Londoner Kirchspiel St. Vedast gekauft hatte, heiratete er, inzwischen im Range eines Esquire, am 28. Mai 1618 in St. Andrews in Holborn die noch nicht ganz 17-jährige Ursula Woodgate († 1652). Ab etwa 1621 lebte das Ehepaar in Stapleford, Hertfordshire, wo zwischen 1622 und 1625 drei Kinder getauft wurden. Insgesamt hatten sie achtzehn Kinder, von denen mindestens die Hälfte in der Kindheit starb. Anstatt entsprechend seiner juristischen Ausbildung einem Beruf nachzugehen, lebte Francis Quarles vom Erbe seiner Eltern und den Erträgen seines Landbesitzes und widmete sein Leben seiner Frömmigkeit und der Bildung. In den Jahren nach der Eheschließung veröffentlichte er bis 1626 seine ersten fünf religiösen Dichtungen, Nacherzählungen biblischer Geschichten.', 'Am 22. April 1626 brachte er zusammen mit drei weiteren Geschäftsleuten, darunter William Luckyn (1594–1658/60), wie er Mitglied von Lincoln’s Inn, im Oberhaus einen Gesetzentwurf für ein Patent für eine neue Methode der Salpetergewinnung ein, mit dem der Aufbau gewinnträchtiger Salpeterfabriken ermöglicht werden sollte. Zwar scheiterte dieses Vorhaben, doch schloss Quarles etwa zur selben Zeit Bekanntschaft mit James Ussher, dem gelehrten Primas der protestantischen Kirche von Irland. Er trat als Sekretär in dessen Dienste und begleitete ihn mit seiner Familie nach Irland. Dabei profitierte er von Usshers umfassender Gelehrsamkeit und übernahm von ihm auch die Praxis der geistlichen Meditation, die für seine späteren Werke entscheidend wurde. In Dublin erschien 1629 die in Verse gebrachte Romanze \\"Argalus and Parthenia\\", die im Gewande einer abenteuerlichen Geschichte den Sieg der Liebe und Treue über den Tod feierte. Gewidmet war das Werk Henry Rich, 1. Earl of Holland. Die von dem einflussreichen königlichen Günstling erhoffte Unterstützung blieb jedoch aus.', 'Erfolge und politische Wirren.', 'Um 1630 kehrte Quarles mit seiner Familie nach England zurück und lebte zunächst an wechselnden Orten. Zwei 1630 und 1633 geborene Kinder sind in St Dunstan-in-the-West in London im Taufregister eingetragen. Offensichtlich litt Quarles unter finanziellen Schwierigkeiten, wie eine Petition an den König 1631 erahnen lässt. Diese und die Widmung der \\"Divine Poems\\", einer Gesamtausgabe seiner geistlichen Dichtungen, an den König brachten ihm möglicherweise die Anwartschaft auf Einnahmen auf den Tabakimport nach Irland ein, wobei unklar ist, ob er die Pfründe wirklich bekam.', 'Spätestens 1633 ließ er sich mit seiner Familie in Roxwell in Essex nieder als Nachbar oder möglicherweise Mieter im Hause seines Geschäftsfreundes Baronet William Luckyn, der 1637/38 Sheriff von Essex war. Dort freundete er sich mit den Dichtern Phineas Fletcher und Edward Benlowes (auch \\"Bendlowes\\", 1603–1676) an. Im Register der Kirche von Roxwell sind zwischen 1633 und 1638 die Taufe von vier und die Beerdigung von zwei Kindern verzeichnet.', '1629 hatte König Karl I. das Parlament aufgelöst und regierte als absoluter Herrscher mit Unterstützung seiner Berater Thomas Wentworth, 1. Earl of Strafford, und William Laud, dem Bischof von London. Laud versuchte, in der anglikanischen Kirche eine strenge Hierarchie durchzusetzen und eine dem Katholizismus angenäherte einheitliche Liturgie einzuführen. Erstmals seit der Reformation wurden in England wieder Kirchen gebaut und bestehende Kirchen mit neuer Ausstattung versehen. Sowohl die einflussreichen Puritaner als auch die presbyterianische Kirche von Schottland lehnten Lauds Kirchenpolitik ab. Auch Quarles äußerte in seinen \\"Divine Fancies\\" von 1632 Kritik daran. Mit diesem Werk machte er sich einen Namen als Epigramm-Dichter. Offener gegen die Missstände in Land und Kirche sprach er sich in den um diese Zeit verfassten zehn Eklogen der \\"Shepheards Oracles\\" aus, in denen er die Schäferdichtung allegorisch und satirisch für politisch-kirchliche Zeitkritik verwendete. Die \\"Shepheards Oracles\\" wurden jedoch erst 1646, zwei Jahre nach seinem Tod, von dem Verleger John Marriot herausgegeben. Darin befürwortete Quarles ganz im Sinne von Ussher eine Kirchenreform, die einen Mittelweg zwischen hochkirchlichem Absolutismus und radikal sozialrevolutionärem Puritanismus nach frühchristlichem Vorbild darstellt.', 'In Roxwell verfasste Quarles mit \\"Emblemes\\" das Werk, das seinen dauernden Ruhm begründete. Das Buch erschien 1635 in erster Auflage. Den großen Erfolg dieses mit emblematischen Bildern versehenen Gedichtbandes setzte er 1638 mit \\"Hieroglyphics of the Life of Man\\" fort. Dieser schmale Band war „Mary, Countess of Dorset“ (1585–1645) gewidmet, der Ehefrau von Edward Sackville, 4. Earl of Dorset, Kammerherr der Königin Henrietta Maria, und Gouvernante der königlichen Kinder. In seiner Widmung dankte Quarles ihr für ihre großherzige Unterstützung.', 'Wirtschaftliche Probleme.', 'Zwischen der Beerdigung des dreijährigen Sohns Edward in Roxwell am 26. Mai 1638 und der Taufe eines weiteren Sohns in Terling am 13. Januar 1640 verließ er mit seiner Familie Roxwell und zog nach Terling bei Chelmsford in Essex, wo die beiden jüngsten Kinder getauft wurden. Die dortige Gemeinde war auch nach Vertreibung zweier Pastoren nach Neuengland durch Lauds Kirchenpolitik dem Puritanismus treu geblieben, und der neue Pastor John Stalham entwickelte sich unter ihrem Einfluss zum Anhänger Oliver Cromwells. In der Umgebung führte der Zorn über die Auflösung des Kurzen Parlaments 1640 zur Zerstörung von als „papistisch“ angesehenen Büchern, darunter auch das \\"Book of Common Prayer\\", von liturgischen Gewändern und den von Laud eingeführten Kircheneinbauten wie etwa Altarschranken.

Darin wird ein fiktives, literarisch gestaltetes Gespräch wörtlich wiedergegeben. Beteiligt sind Platons Lehrer Sokrates und zwei Mathematiker: der junge Theaitetos, nach dem der Dialog benannt ist, und dessen Lehrer Theodoros von Kyrene.', 'Das Thema bilden Kernfragen der Erkenntnistheorie. Erörtert wird, worin Erkenntnis besteht und wie man gesichertes Wissen von wahren, aber unbewiesenen Behauptungen unterscheidet. Dabei stellt sich die Frage, ob eine solche allgemeine Unterscheidung überhaupt möglich ist und überzeugend begründet werden kann. Es soll geklärt werden, unter welchen Voraussetzungen man den Anspruch erheben kann, etwas zu wissen und darüber nachweislich wahre Aussagen zu machen. Benötigt wird ein unanfechtbares Kriterium für erwiesene Wahrheit.', 'Im Verlauf der Diskussion scheitern alle Versuche, den Unterschied zwischen Wissen und richtigem Meinen zu bestimmen. Wenn sinnvolle Aussagen überhaupt möglich sind, muss es objektive Wahrheit geben, denn jeder Diskurs setzt die Unterscheidung von „wahr“ und „falsch“ voraus. Es gelingt aber nicht, mittels eines allgemein anwendbaren Kriteriums mutmaßlich richtige von nachweislich richtigen Vorstellungen abzugrenzen. Jede der vorgeschlagenen Definitionen von „Wissen“ trifft auch auf eine richtige, aber unbewiesene Annahme zu. Damit erweist sich die Verwendung des Begriffs „Wissen“ als grundsätzlich problematisch. Anscheinend kann man zwar wahre Aussagen machen, aber nicht wirklich wissen, dass sie wahr sind. Der Dialog endet in einer Ratlosigkeit (Aporie).', 'In der philosophiegeschichtlichen Forschung haben die erkenntnistheoretischen Erörterungen im \\"Theaitetos\\" zu lebhaften Debatten geführt, die weiterhin andauern. Dabei geht es vor allem um die Frage nach Platons eigener Position. Einer Hypothese zufolge hat er die erkenntnistheoretische Skepsis, die sich aus dem Fehlschlag der Bemühungen im Dialog zu ergeben scheint, zumindest zeitweilig selbst vertreten, nachdem er mit seiner Ideenlehre in unüberwindlich scheinende logische Schwierigkeiten geraten war. Die Gegenmeinung besagt, er habe die pessimistische Einschätzung der Möglichkeit von Wissen nicht geteilt. Vielmehr habe er sie im \\"Theaitetos\\" nur dargelegt, um die Leser dazu anzuregen, das Problem zu erfassen und zu lösen.', 'Ort, Zeit und Umstände.', 'Die Gesprächssituation ist wahrscheinlich von Platon frei erfunden. Die Dialoghandlung ist in eine ebenfalls fiktive Rahmenhandlung eingebettet. Zwei ehemalige Schüler des schon vor langer Zeit hingerichteten Sokrates, Eukleides und Terpsion, führen das Rahmengespräch. Sie treffen in ihrer Heimatstadt Megara im äußersten Westen der Landschaft Attika zusammen. Eukleides erzählt, dass er von Sokrates viel über dessen denkwürdige Unterredungen mit dem damals noch sehr jungen Theaitetos gehört hat. Diese Gespräche fanden in Athen, der Heimatstadt von Sokrates und Theaitetos, statt. Eine solche Diskussion hat Eukleides, dem Bericht des Sokrates folgend, aus dem Gedächtnis in einem Buch aufgezeichnet. Dort gibt er den Gesprächsverlauf durchgängig in direkter Rede wieder. Auf Terpsions Wunsch lässt er nun das Buch vorlesen. Dessen Inhalt macht die Binnenhandlung des \\"Theaitetos\\" aus.', 'Für die Zeit der Rahmenhandlung bieten die Angaben des Eukleides einen wichtigen Anhaltspunkt. Er hat soeben im Hafen von Megara Theaitetos getroffen, der kürzlich in einem Kampf bei Korinth verwundet worden ist und nun nach Athen gebracht wird. Gemeint ist anscheinend eine militärische Auseinandersetzung im Rahmen des Korinthischen Krieges, aber nicht die Schlacht von Korinth im Jahr 392 v. Chr., sondern möglicherweise ein Gefecht zwischen athenischen und spartanischen Truppen im Frühjahr 391 v. Chr. Demnach liegt der Tod des Sokrates, der 399 v. Chr. hingerichtet wurde, zur Zeit der Rahmenhandlung schon acht Jahre zurück. Allerdings ist diese Datierung umstritten; nach einer alternativen, von vielen Forschern akzeptierten Hypothese fällt die Teilnahme des Theaitetos an Kämpfen bei Korinth in das Jahr 369 v. Chr. Damals unterlag eine Allianz, an der die Athener beteiligt waren, einer Streitmacht des thebanischen Feldherrn Epameinondas.', 'Der \\"Theaitetos\\" ist der erste Teil einer Trilogie, einer Gruppe von drei inhaltlich und szenisch verknüpften Dialogen, die sich innerhalb von zwei Tagen abspielen. Am ersten Tag findet das Gespräch von Sokrates, Theaitetos und Theodoros statt, das die Handlung des \\"Theaitetos\\" bildet. Der folgende Tag beginnt mit der in Platons Dialog \\"Sophistes\\" dargestellten Diskussion, in der sich Sokrates ganz zurückhält. Dort tritt ein neuer Gesprächsteilnehmer auf, der „Fremde aus Elea“, der mit Theaitetos und Theodoros Definitionsfragen untersucht. Dabei kommt die schon im \\"Theaitetos\\" behandelte Wahrheitsproblematik wiederum ins Blickfeld, diesmal unter einem anderen Gesichtspunkt. Am gleichen Tag folgt der dritte Dialog, der \\"Politikos\\" („Staatsmann“). Dort wird die Vorgehensweise beim Definieren anhand des Beispiels der Definition des Begriffs „Staatsmann“ erprobt.', 'Der Zeitpunkt der drei Diskussionen ist das Frühjahr 399 v. Chr.; der Prozess gegen Sokrates, in dem er zum Tode verurteilt wird, steht bevor. Im \\"Theaitetos\\" wird erwähnt, dass die Anklage gegen ihn bereits erhoben ist. Die zeitliche Nähe zur Hinrichtung des Philosophen, einem Platons Zeitgenossen vertrauten Ereignis, bildet unausgesprochen den Hintergrund des Geschehens. Sie trägt zu der Wirkung bei, die Platon bei den Lesern erzielen will. Die Auseinandersetzung mit diesem für die Sokratiker und Platoniker erschütternden Vorgang ist ein wesentlicher Aspekt von Platons schriftstellerischer Tätigkeit.', 'Der Schauplatz der Handlung des \\"Theaitetos\\" ist die Palaistra – ein für Ringkämpfe bestimmter Übungsplatz – in einem athenischen Gymnasion. Die Gymnasien dienten damals in erster Linie der körperlichen Ertüchtigung; außerdem war eine Palaistra auch ein sozialer Treffpunkt der Jugend. Aus den Schilderungen in Platons Dialogen geht hervor, dass sich Sokrates gern an solchen Orten aufhielt. Dort bot sich ihm Gelegenheit zu fruchtbaren philosophischen Gesprächen mit jungen Männern und Jugendlichen. Neben den drei Gesprächspartnern Sokrates, Theaitetos und Theodoros sind noch zwei Freunde des Theaitetos anwesend, die schweigend zuhören. Einer von ihnen ist Sokrates der Jüngere.', 'Die Teilnehmer.', 'Sokrates', 'Wie in vielen anderen Dialogen Platons übernimmt auch hier Sokrates die Rolle des Gesprächslenkers. In der Kunst der philosophischen Untersuchung ist er den beiden Mathematikern weit überlegen. Er zeigt ihnen, dass ihre bisherigen Vorstellungen einer Nachprüfung nicht standhalten. Die Ratlosigkeit, in die er seine Gesprächspartner stürzt, ist von ihm beabsichtigt; sie ist ein didaktisches Mittel, mit dem er zu weiteren Anstrengungen anspornen will. Um diese Wirkung zu erzielen, bringt er die Unzulänglichkeit der Ansätze der anderen ans Licht und vermeidet es dabei sorgfältig, sich zu einer eigenen Auffassung zu bekennen. Auf den Grund für diese Zurückhaltung, die ein Hauptmerkmal seiner gewohnten Vorgehensweise ist, geht er im \\"Theaitetos\\" näher ein. Er beschreibt sich als Geburtshelfer, der zwar selbst unwissend sei, aber anderen zur „Geburt“ ihrer Einsichten verhelfen könne.', 'Nach einer verbreiteten, früher allgemein vorherrschenden Interpretation fungiert Sokrates hier wie auch in anderen Werken Platons als „Sprachrohr“ des Autors; das heißt, er gibt dessen Sichtweise oder zumindest einen Teil des platonischen Konzepts wieder. Allerdings wird diese Gleichsetzung von manchen Philosophiehistorikern abgelehnt oder nur mit erheblichen Einschränkungen akzeptiert. Hinzu kommt, dass manche Äußerungen des platonischen Sokrates nicht oder nur teilweise ernst gemeint sind. Unklar und strittig ist, inwieweit die Positionen von Platons Dialogfigur mit denen des historischen Sokrates übereinstimmen. Ein analoges Problem besteht hinsichtlich der Lehre des berühmten Sophisten Protagoras, die Sokrates im \\"Theaitetos\\" beschreibt und bekämpft: Die Frage, wie getreu Platons Darstellung die Denkweise des historischen Protagoras wiedergibt, ist umstritten. Deutlich erkennbar ist jedenfalls Platons Absicht, Protagoras in ungünstigem Licht erscheinen zu lassen.', 'Theodoros', 'Der Mathematiker Theodoros ist keine erfundene Gestalt; an seiner historischen Existenz besteht kein Zweifel und Platons Angaben zu ihm gelten großenteils als glaubhaft. Er stammte aus Kyrene, einer griechischen Stadt im heutigen Libyen. Dass er zur Generation des Sokrates gehörte, ergibt sich nicht nur aus Platons Darstellung, sondern geht auch aus der \\"Geschichte der Geometrie\\" des Eudemos von Rhodos hervor. Die Angaben der Quellen führen zur Datierung seiner Geburt um 475/460 v. Chr. Da er Sokrates überlebte, ist er frühestens 399 v. Chr. gestorben. Er war ein Schüler und Freund des Protagoras, doch wandte er sich schon früh von der Sophistik ab und der Geometrie zu. Nach Platons wohl zutreffenden Angaben war er nicht nur Mathematiker, sondern galt auch in der Astronomie und Musik als hervorragender Fachmann und erteilte in diesen Fächern Unterricht. Vielleicht zählte Platon selbst zu seinen Schülern. Allerdings ist ungewiss, ob Theodoros jemals in Athen war. Der Philosophiegeschichtsschreiber Diogenes Laertios behauptet, Platon habe ihn in Kyrene aufgesucht. Möglicherweise ist sein Aufenthalt in Athen, von dem im \\"Theaitetos\\" berichtet wird, eine Erfindung Platons zu dem literarischen Zweck, ihn mit Sokrates zusammentreffen zu lassen. Der spätantike Philosoph Iamblichos zählte Theodoros zu den Pythagoreern, doch wird die Glaubwürdigkeit dieser Nachricht in der Forschung bezweifelt.', 'Zur Zeit der Handlung des \\"Theaitetos\\" ist Theodoros ebenso wie Sokrates bereits ein alter Mann. Nach der Darstellung im Dialog betrachtet er sich nicht als Philosophen, sondern beschränkt sich bewusst auf sein Fach, die Geometrie, in die er sich nach seinen Worten „gerettet“ hat. Somit gehört er in Platons Augen nicht zur Elite der Weisheitsliebenden. An philosophischen Untersuchungen will er sich nicht beteiligen, da er sich auf diesem Gebiet für unzuständig hält und auch meint, dafür zu alt zu sein.

Der Grünspecht und seine Schwesterart, der Grauspecht ('), sind die einzigen Vertreter der Gattung \\"Picus\\" in Mitteleuropa.', 'Beschreibung.', 'Der Grünspecht wird bis zu 32 Zentimeter lang und hat eine Flügelspannweite von bis zu 52 Zentimetern. Die Oberseite ist dunkelgrün, die Unterseite ist blass hell- bis graugrün gefärbt. Der Kopf ist an den Seiten durch eine schwarze Gesichtsmaske gezeichnet, die vom Schnabel bis hinter die Augen reicht, was ihm die Bezeichnung \\"Fliegender Zorro\\" im Volksmund einbringt. Der Oberkopf und der Nacken sind rot, der Bürzel grüngelb. Die Ohrgegend, Kinn und Kehle sind dagegen weißlich. Die Flügel oder Schwingen der Tiere sind braunschwarz, gelblich oder bräunlichweiß gefleckt. Die Steuerfedern sind auf grüngrauem Grund schwärzlich gebändert. Die Unterschiede zwischen den Geschlechtern sind gering, beim Männchen ist der Wangenfleck rot mit einem schwarzen Rand, beim Weibchen ist dieser Wangenfleck einfarbig schwarz. Die Augen des Grünspechts sind bläulichweiß, Schnabel und Füße sind bleigrau. Männchen und Weibchen sind gleich groß und schwer. Fänglinge in der Camargue wogen im Mittel 177 g (Männchen) oder 174 g (Weibchen), die Spanne reichte von 138 g bis 201 g.', 'Das Jugendgefieder unterscheidet sich stark von dem Gefieder der erwachsenen Tiere, es ist insgesamt deutlich matter. Kopfseiten, Hals und die Unterseite sind auf fast weißem Grund stark dunkel gefleckt bis gebändert. Die roten Anteile der Kopffärbung sind unscheinbar und meistens mit grauen Flecken durchsetzt. Die Flügel und die Gefiederoberseite weisen zudem eine deutliche weiße Fleckung auf.', 'In Mitteleuropa kann der Grünspecht nur mit dem etwas kleineren, aber sonst sehr ähnlichen Grauspecht verwechselt werden. Im Gegensatz zum Grünspecht hat der Grauspecht jedoch einen grauen Kopf, ein dunkelrotes Auge und nur einen schmalen schwarzen Kinnstreif. Dem Grauspecht fehlt außerdem der rote Scheitel des Grünspechtes, nur beim Männchen ist der Vorderkopf rot, beim Weibchen fehlt eine rote Kopfzeichnung. Oft gibt schon der Beobachtungsort Hinweise zur Artbestimmung, der Grauspecht fehlt im Nordwesten Mitteleuropas und ist im Vergleich zum Grünspecht viel stärker an Gebirge und an Wald gebunden (siehe Verbreitung).', 'Mauser.', 'Die Jugendmauser erfolgt kontinuierlich und beginnt bereits in der Bruthöhle. Im Verlauf von etwa vier Monaten ist sie abgeschlossen und entsprechend besitzen die Jungtiere im Spätherbst bereits das Federkleid der Adultvögel.', 'Lautäußerungen und Trommelgeräusch.', 'Grünspechte trommeln deutlich seltener als die meisten anderen heimischen Spechte. Sie produzieren dann nur leise und unregelmäßige Wirbel. Auffällig ist dagegen der markante Reviergesang, der von beiden Geschlechtern, intensiver jedoch vom Männchen, geäußert wird. Dieser klingt wie ein lautes Lachen (\\"„klü-klü-klü-klü-klü-klü-klü“\\"). Die aus bis zu 20 Silben bestehende, etwas nasal klingende Rufreihe bleibt auf einer Tonhöhe und wird gegen Ende schneller und etwas leiser. Häufig ist ein zweisilbiger, deutlicher Abschluss (\\"„klü-ück“\\"). Bei warmem Winterwetter sind diese Rufe in Mitteleuropa schon im Dezember und Januar zu hören, üblicherweise jedoch erst gegen Ende Februar. Die ähnliche Rufreihe des Grauspechtes klingt reiner und liegt in der Tonhöhe meist etwas höher. Die Strophe fällt in der Tonhöhe ab, wird gegen Ende hin langsamer und deutlich leiser und verstummt ohne Akzent. Grünspechte äußern beim Landen oft ein scharfes \\"„Kjäck“\\", zuweilen auch \\"„Kjück“\\", das bei Beunruhigung oder in Aggressionssituationen zu einem mehrsilbigen Ruf (\\"„Kjück-Kjück-Kjück-Kjück“\\") gereiht wird.', 'Verbreitung und Lebensraum.', 'Der Grünspecht bewohnt große Teile Europas und Vorderasiens, sein Vorkommen liegt also in der westlichen Paläarktis. Er kommt dabei vom südlichen Skandinavien und Großbritannien über den größten Teil des europäischen Festlandes bis in das Mittelmeergebiet und im Südosten bis zum Kaukasus, Turkmenistan und zum nördlichen Iran vor. Die boreale Nadelwaldzone im Norden und die Steppen und Halbwüsten im Süden des Verbreitungsgebietes werden nur randlich besiedelt.', 'Er bevorzugt halboffene Landschaften mit ausgedehnten Althölzern, vor allem Waldränder, Feldgehölze, Streuobstwiesen, Parks, Haine und große Gärten mit Baumbestand. Innerhalb ausgedehnter Waldgebiete kommt er nur in stark aufgelichteten Bereichen, an Waldwiesen und größeren Lichtungen vor. Die Art zeigt dabei eine starke Präferenz für Laubwälder, in ausgedehnten Nadelholzforsten kann sie großflächig sehr selten sein oder fehlen.', 'Der Grünspecht ist aufgrund seiner starken Spezialisierung auf bodenlebende Ameisen anfällig für strenge Winter mit hohen Schneelagen. Schwerpunkt der Verbreitung sind daher die Niederungen und die unteren Lagen der Mittelgebirge bis in eine Höhe von etwa 500 m über NN. Im schneereichen und von Nadelwäldern dominierten Bayerischen Wald ist er sehr selten und fehlt oberhalb 900 m ganz. Die Höhenverbreitung scheint zusätzlich durch das Vorkommen des vor allem in der collinen Stufe verbreiteten Grauspechtes beeinflusst zu werden, bei gleichzeitigem Vorkommen beider Arten kann der Grünspecht schon in Höhenlagen ab 150 m über NN großflächig fehlen (etwa in Nordrhein-Westfalen), diese Höhenlagen sind dann vom Grauspecht besiedelt.', 'Im Alpenraum ist diese Begrenzung der Verbreitung hinsichtlich der Meereshöhe so nicht vorhanden. In den Bayerischen Voralpen und Alpen besiedelt der Grünspecht alle Höhenlagen von 600 bis 1400 m über NN recht gleichmäßig und wurde bis in 1700 m Meereshöhe nachgewiesen, der Grauspecht besiedelte dieselben Höhenlagen in etwas geringerer Dichte. In der Schweiz liegt der Schwerpunkt der Verbreitung in Höhen bis 1000 m NN, die Art kommt dort jedoch regelmäßig bis in Höhen von 2000 m über NN vor. Der Grauspecht ist dort auf Höhenlagen unter etwa 700 m über NN beschränkt, besiedelt also dort nur die colline Stufe. Die höchsten Nachweise liegen dabei im Kanton Wallis in der Schweiz in 2150 m Höhe, im Transkaukasus wurde der Grünspecht sogar in 2745 m Höhe nachgewiesen.', 'Lebensweise.', 'Aktivität.', 'Der Grünspecht ist tagaktiv, bei Dunkelheit bewegt er sich nur noch kletternd. Er hat eine regelmäßige Aktivitätsphase und kann in dieser über Wochen täglich die gleichen Routen abfliegen und an denselben Plätzen seine Nahrung suchen. Die Aktivitätsphase selbst dauert abhängig vom Tageslicht zwischen acht Stunden im Dezember und 15 Stunden im Juli.', 'Der Grünspecht bewegt sich häufig und geschickter als die anderen Spechte am Boden, wodurch er auch als „Erdspecht“ bekannt ist (nicht zu verwechseln mit \\"Geocolaptes olivaceus\\", dem südafrikanischen Erdspecht). Dabei hüpft er Strecken bis zu drei Metern in einzelnen Sprüngen von maximal 25 Zentimetern ab, ohne zu fliegen. Im Gegensatz zum Bunt- und zum Blutspecht klettert der Grünspecht nicht ruckartig, sondern eher fließend, dabei allerdings nicht so schnell wie der Grauspecht.', 'Bei relativ dicht stehenden Baumreihen fliegt er auch nicht von einem Baum zum nächsten, sondern überwindet die Distanzen in einem recht charakteristischen Segelflug. Dabei klettert er zunächst den einen Baumstamm empor, um anschließend von unterhalb der Baumkrone bis zum Fuß des nächsten Baumes zu gleiten. Er wiederholt dieses Schauspiel gern vielfach hintereinander.', 'Er ist ein weitgehend standorttreuer Vogel, der nur kurze Wanderungen unternimmt. Im Winter schweift er teilweise weit umher und erscheint oft in Gärten, um dort nach Nahrung zu suchen. Es handelt sich entsprechend um einen Stand- und Strichvogel. Die Jungvögel verlassen die Reviere ihrer Eltern und suchen sich eigene Reviere in deren Nähe, auch bei diesen Wanderungen entfernen sie sich in der Regel nur bis zu 30 Kilometer vom Geburtsort. Die weitesten bislang durch Beringung nachgewiesenen Wanderungen betrugen in einem Fall 82 km, in einem weiteren 170 km.', 'Ernährung.', 'Der Grünspecht sucht seine Nahrung fast ausschließlich auf dem Boden, er hackt viel weniger an Bäumen als die anderen Spechte.', 'Von allen mitteleuropäischen Spechten ist der Grünspecht am meisten auf bodenbewohnende Ameisen spezialisiert. Diese fängt er in ihren Gängen mit seiner 10 Zentimeter langen Zunge, die in ein verhorntes und mit Widerhaken bestücktes Ende ausläuft.', 'In den frühen Morgenstunden, kurz nach Sonnenaufgang, suchen Grünspechte Wiesen- und Weideflächen mit lockerem Oberboden und Störstellen auf, um mit ihren langen Schnäbeln gezielt mehrere Zentimeter tiefe Löcher zu bohren. Dabei erbeuten die Vögel häufig die Rote Waldameise und andere \\"Formica\\"-Arten, im Sommer verschiedene \\"Lasius\\"-Arten (Wegameisen). Im Winter graben Grünspechte Tunnel in den Schnee, um zu Ameisenhügeln zu gelangen, die dann meist regelmäßig besucht werden. Vor allem im Winter sucht er Felswände auf, aber auch regelmäßig Dächer, Hauswände oder Leitungsmasten, und sucht dort in Spalten nach überwinternden Arthropoden, vor allem nach Fliegen, Mücken und Spinnen. Würmer und weitere Wirbellose sind dagegen nur selten Teil der Ernährung. Gelegentlich fressen Grünspechte auch Beeren, etwa Vogelbeeren und die Samenmäntel der Eibe, und anderes Obst wie Kirschen, Äpfel oder Trauben.', 'Fortpflanzung und Entwicklung.', 'Grünspechte erreichen ihre Geschlechtsreife noch im ersten Lebensjahr. Die Balz beginnt mit ersten Kontaktrufen der Männchen ab Dezember und nimmt dann über den Januar und Februar deutlich zu.

Jahrhundert)', 'Literatur (Französisch)', 'Literatur (Paris)', 'Roman, Epik'], 'Ein Mann der schläft () ist ein Roman des französischen Schriftstellers Georges Perec, der im Jahr 1967 veröffentlicht wurde. Der Protagonist, ein 25-jähriger Student, verweigert sich von einem Tag auf den anderen dem Leben und zieht sich in Isolation und Gleichgültigkeit zurück. Die Handlung hat autobiografische Wurzeln. Perec litt in jungen Jahren selbst an einer ähnlich verlaufenen Depression. Die Umsetzung zeichnet sich durch zahlreiche intertextuelle Verweise auf andere Werke der Literaturgeschichte aus. Auffällig ist auch die formale Gestaltung: Der kurze Roman steht überwiegend im Präsens und in der Du-Form. Er zählt zu den am geringsten untersuchten Hauptwerken George Perecs und entstand noch vor dessen Mitgliedschaft in der Autorengruppe Oulipo. Eine Verfilmung des Autors gemeinsam mit Bernard Queysanne erhielt 1974 den Jean-Vigo-Preis. Eugen Helmlés deutsche Übersetzung blieb lange unveröffentlicht und erschien erstmals im Jahr 1988.', 'Inhalt.', 'An einem heißen Sommertag, einem Prüfungstag für sein Staatsexamen, steht ein 25-jähriger Soziologiestudent in Paris nicht wie gewöhnlich beim Klingeln seines Weckers auf, sondern bleibt einfach liegen. In ihm ist etwas zerbrochen, was ihn bisher an die Welt gebunden hat. Er kommt zur Erkenntnis, dass er nicht zu leben versteht und dies niemals tun wird. Auch als an den nächsten Tagen Freunde an seine Tür klopfen, rührt er sich nicht. Die unter der Tür durchgeschobenen Mitteilungen wirft er weg. Erst bei Nacht verlässt er sein fünf Quadratmeter großes Mansardenzimmer und läuft ziellos durch die Straßen, lässt sich von der anonymen Masse die Grands Boulevards entlangtreiben von der Place de la République bis zur Kirche La Madeleine.', 'Für einige Wochen unterbricht der namenlose Protagonist dieses abgeschottete Leben, reist zu seinen Eltern in ein Dorf nahe Auxerre. Doch auch dort führt er den Müßiggang weiter, macht ausgedehnte Spaziergänge, schläft viel, redet wenig. Er hat das Gefühl, er habe kaum gelebt, und dennoch sei bereits alles gesagt. Warum soll man den Gipfel eines Berges erklimmen, wenn man hinterher doch wieder hinabsteigen muss? Er beschließt, sich aus dem Leben herauszuhalten.', 'Zurück in Paris wartet abermals sein Zimmer und die Isolation. Er will sich sämtlichen Dingen des Lebens entwöhnen, bis er am Ende ein zeitloses Pflanzenleben lebt. Gleichberechtigt liest er alles, was ihm unter die Augen kommt, und geht abends ins erstbeste Kino. Sein Gang ins Café wird zur reinen Nahrungsaufnahme. Die Streifzüge durch Paris treiben ihn in zunehmend unbekannte Winkel, er kann stundenlang in der Betrachtung eines Baumes versinken. Manchmal verlässt er sein Zimmer für Tage nicht, studiert bloß die Risse in der Decke oder spielt eine Patience nach der anderen, deren Ordnung ihn fasziniert. Er fühlt sich unberührbar, vollkommen gleichgültig, frei von allem, was ihm ge- oder missfallen könnte, beschützt vor jeder Überraschung. Die Welt hat keine Macht mehr über ihn.', 'Doch irgendwann verliert er die Illusion der Unangreifbarkeit, schleicht sich die Furcht und die Einsamkeit in sein Leben. Bei seinen Spaziergängen steigt das Gefühl in ihm auf, sich in einer toten Stadt zu befinden. Alle Menschen, denen er begegnet, nimmt er als Ausgestoßene wahr, wie er einer ist. Er fühlt sich mehr und mehr wie ein Gefangener in seiner Zelle, wie eine Ratte im Labyrinth. Mit penibler Ordnung versucht er seinem Leben Halt zu geben. Doch ohne das Gefühl einer Zuflucht wartet er nur noch, bis alles vorüber geht.', 'Er erkennt, dass er in seinem Bemühen, auf den Grund seines Daseins zu gelangen, nichts erreicht hat. Die Einsamkeit hat ihn nichts gelehrt, ihn nicht weitergebracht, seine Gleichgültigkeit ist sinnlos und ändert nichts. Alles läuft ab, ob er daran teilnimmt, oder ob er sich verweigert. Er hat sich als Märtyrer gefühlt, doch kein Wunder ist geschehen, niemand hat ihn gerettet, er ist auch nicht gestorben. Die Welt hat sich nicht gerührt, und er hat sich nicht verändert. Am Ende besiegt die Zeit seinen Willen, befiehlt er sich: „Hör auf zu reden wie ein Mensch, der träumt.“ Er findet wieder ins Leben zurück, wo seine erste Empfindung Angst ist und seine erste Tat das Warten auf das Ende des Regens an der Place de Clichy.', 'Form.', 'Aufbau.', '\\"Ein Mann der schläft\\" umfasst je nach Ausgabe um die 140 Seiten, wird aber seit seiner Veröffentlichung, so auch in der deutschen Fassung, von den Verlagen als Roman ausgewiesen. Dabei widerspricht der Aufbau den Prinzipien eines traditionellen Romans mit sequentiell abfolgender Handlung. Leonard Fuest, der von einer Erzählung sprach, sah anstelle eines roten Fadens eine „wuchernde Meditation über den Stillstand“, eine Ansammlung von Bildern, Beobachtungen, Reflexionen und Phantasien: „Es türmt sich hier die signifikante Fülle einer Leere auf.“', 'Der Roman teilt sich in sechzehn Sektionen, bei denen jedoch bereits das Fehlen einer Nummerierung von der ordnenden Funktion üblicher Kapiteleinteilungen abweicht. Die einzelnen Sektionen sind mono- oder multithematisch. Sie unterteilen sich ihrerseits in kurze Textabschnitte, von denen viele ohne Bezug zum vorigen oder folgenden Abschnitt gelesen werden können und so dem Roman einen fragmentarischen Charakter verleihen. Die ersten beiden Sektionen bilden eine Exposition. Dabei liefert die erste Sektion eine Phänomenologie des Einschlafprozesses, die motivisch mit dem folgenden Rückzug von der Welt korrespondiert und durch die Mehrdeutigkeit der verwendeten Bilder bereits auf den künftigen Verlauf der Handlung verweist. Der zweite Abschnitt führt den Protagonisten, seine Umgebung und alle wesentlichen Handlungselemente ein. Nach dieser Ouvertüre besteht der Roman vor allem aus einer Wiederholung, Variation und Ausweitung der eingeführten Motive. Ab Sektion 14 werden die Reprisen der Motive immer mehr zurückgenommen und verschwinden vollständig in einem Finale, das die Vergeblichkeit der vorigen Handlung bestätigt. In dieser durch Themen und Variationen geprägten Struktur von \\"Ein Mann der schläft\\" sah Stéphane Bigot eine eher musikalische Komposition als einen Romanaufbau gemäß traditionellen Regeln.', '\\"Ein Mann der schläft\\" steht überwiegend im Präsens, was den Handlungen wie der Ansprache des Protagonisten den Anschein von Unmittelbarkeit gibt. Dabei beziehen sich die Aussagen zu Beginn des Romans auf einen gegenwärtigen Zeitpunkt: „Du stehst auf. Du gehst zum Fenster, das du schließt.“ Später dehnt sich der Bezug des Präsens jedoch mehr und mehr aus, die Aktionen erhalten einen sich wiederholenden, dauerhaften Charakter: „Manchmal bleibst du drei vier fünf Tage in deinem Zimmer, du weißt es nicht.“ Dabei gehorcht die temporale Ordnung keiner Chronologie, markiert keine Etappen und Stadien, Anfänge und Enden, sondern lässt die einzelnen Handlungsabschnitte ohne Trennung ineinander gleiten.', 'Erzählperspektive.', 'Das augenfälligste Merkmal des Textes ist seine Erzählperspektive. Er ist vollständig in der „Du-Form“ geschrieben. Dies führt zu Beginn des Romans zu einer direkten Einbeziehung des Lesers, die auch nach Einführung des Protagonisten weiter anhält. Durch die Du-Form werden die Grenzen zwischen Erzähler, Protagonist und Leser fließend. Sie lässt sich auf zweierlei Arten verstehen: dem Protagonisten wird seine Geschichte erzählt, oder er berichtet in einem Selbstgespräch über sich selbst. Durch die zweite Person singular werde Kathrin Glosch zufolge die Frage der Identität aufgeworfen, die auch im Text selbst anklinge: „Du rührst dich nicht. Du wirst dich nicht rühren. Ein anderer, ein Doppelgänger, ein gespenstiges und gewissenhaftes Double macht, vielleicht statt deiner die Gebärden, die du nicht mehr machst: er steht auf, rasiert sich, zieht sich an, geht weg.“ Fuest sah in der oft distanzierten und ironischen Du-Form eine Entzweiung des Erzählers vom Protagonisten.', 'Perec selbst führte das Du in \\"Ein Mann der schläft\\" auf eine Mischung zwischen Tagebuchform und der direkten Beziehung zwischen Autor und Figur zurück. Zudem verwies er auf das Wortspiel „un je(ux) devenant tu“, was sich direkt als „ein Ich, das zum Du wird“, sowie übertragen als „ein Spiel, das verstummt“ übersetzen lässt. Perecs Biograf David Bellos sah durch die Du-Form vor allem auch das Problem gelöst, dass Perec autobiografische Hintergründe verarbeiten konnte, ohne sich einerseits in der Ich-Form zu kompromittieren oder auf ein lyrisches Ich zurückzuziehen, andererseits in der Er-Form die persönlichen Erfahrungen in konventionelle Fiktion zu übertragen. Die Du-Form erweise sich dagegen als sprachlicher Ausdruck eines Experiments und vermittle die authentische Erfahrung direkt an den Leser. Eine Entsprechung von Form und Inhalt erkannte Roger Kleman, indem er die Du-Form als linguistische Form der absoluten Einsamkeit bezeichnete.', 'Intertextualität.', '\\"Ein Mann der schläft\\" enthält zahlreiche Verweise auf andere literarische Texte. Bellos ging sogar so weit, dass beinahe jeder Satz aus einem anderen Werk stamme, der ganze Roman also eine literarische Collage, beziehungsweise ein Cento sei. In einem Brief an Eugen Helmlé kündigte Perec diesem Kopfschmerzen bei der Übersetzung an, weil die vielen Zitate gar nicht zu entdecken seien. Bellos sah in dem Stilmittel, die autobiografischen Erfahrungen Perecs durch die Worte anderer auszudrücken einen Mechanismus der Selbstverteidigung und eine Form von Bescheidenheit. Ariane Steiner schränkte Bellos’ These allerdings durch die Anmerkung ein, dass es bis zum heutigen Tage keine Möglichkeit gebe, alle intertextuellen Verweise des Romans zu entschlüsseln. Perec habe sich zu dem Thema bis zu seinem Tod bedeckt gehalten, und seine Notizen gaben zwar einzelne Hinweise, aber keine Struktur des Intertextes in seiner Gesamtheit preis.', 'Das einzige Zitat des Romans, das kenntlich gemacht ist, ist das Epigramm, das einem Aphorismus Kafkas entstammt:', 'Im Verlauf des Romans verweist der Erzähler auf die literarischen Vorbilder des Protagonisten, die „Robinsons, Roquentins, Meursaults, Leverkühns“.

Mit dem musikalischen Übergang vom Mittelalter zur Renaissance wurde diese Praxis durch terzbezogene Tonalitäten abgelöst. Seit dem Beginn des 20. Jahrhunderts spielen Quartzusammenklänge in vielen zeitgenössischen Musikstilen wieder eine bedeutende Rolle.

Das Kürzel \\"sus4\\" (von englisch \\"suspended fourth\\": Quartvorhalt) drückt aus, dass der erwarteten Terz in einem stabilen Dur- oder Molldreiklang eine Quarte vorausgeht.

Seit dem 12. Jahrhundert begriffen Komponisten und Musiktheoretiker sie dann im Falle eines Auftretens zwischen der untersten Stimme und einer Oberstimme als auflösungsbedürftige Dissonanz.', 'Im 13. Jahrhundert stand die Quarte zusammen mit der Quinte in der Mittelposition der \\"concordantiae mediae\\", bis sie im 15.

Bei der Quinte beträgt dieses Verhältnis 2:3 (die Oberquinte e2 des Kammertons schwingt also mit 660 Hz); für die sich als Komplementärintervall ergebende Quarte zwischen e2 und a2 (660 und 880 Hz) beträgt die Proportion dementsprechend 3:4. Diese Zahlenverhältnisse waren, zum Beispiel durch Experimente am Monochord, grundsätzlich auch schon den antiken und mittelalterlichen Musiktheoretikern vertraut.', 'Bei den folgenden historischen Ausführungen sei auf das sich wandelnde Frequenzverhältnis der Töne untereinander bei der pythagoreischen Stimmung, der mitteltönigen, gleichstufigen und wohltemperierten Stimmung hingewiesen.', 'Im Laufe der europäischen Musikgeschichte wurden bestimmte Intervalle in polyphoner Musik also offenbar zunächst gerade wegen ihrer einfachen akustischen Beziehung bevorzugt.

Jahrhunderts stellte dann ihrerseits das Regelwerk der „klassischen“ europäischen Tonkunst zur Disposition. So wurden neben bewussten Rückgriffen auf das Mittelalter (zum Beispiel bei Erik Satie) auch völlig neuartige Klänge komponiert, die sehr häufig das Intervall der Quarte als Strukturelement einbeziehen.', 'Definition.', 'Der Begriff Quartenharmonik bezeichnet die Bildung harmonischer Strukturen auf der Basis des Intervalls der Quarte im Gegensatz zur traditionellen Schichtung von Akkorden in Terzen. Während in der dur-moll-tonal gebundenen europäischen Musik (zwischen circa 1600 und 1900) solche quartharmonischen Klänge als auflösungsbedürftige Vorhalte in der Stimmführung besonders behandelt werden mussten, verselbständigten sie sich in der späteren Musik zusehends. Jazz und Rock verwenden Quartharmonien seit den 1960er Jahren mit Vorliebe. Entsprechend zu dieser akkordbezogenen (vertikalen) Strukturierung ist eine melodisch orientierte (horizontale) Verwendung von Quarten gebräuchlich, für die sich der parallele Begriff \\"Quartenmelodik\\" jedoch (bislang) nicht durchsetzen konnte. Eine weitere Form ist die Quartenkopplung. Dies bedeutet, dass man Quarten zur Anreicherung von Klängen benutzt, so wie das normalerweise mit Terzen, Oktaven oder Sexten gemacht wird.', 'Ausgearbeitete Theoriesysteme und Betrachtungsmodelle, welche die harmonische Interpretation von Vierklängen, Fünfklängen und ganzer Sätze ermöglichen (wie sie für die Dreiklangsharmonik mit der Funktionstheorie oder der Stufentheorie und dem Kadenzbegriff existieren), haben sich in Bezug auf die Quartenharmonik nicht entwickelt. In der Literatur finden sich mitunter auch die Begriffe \\"Quartenschichtung\\", \\"Quartturm\\", \\"Quartenstruktur\\" und \\"Quartklang\\", ohne dass diese gegenüber \\"Quartenharmonik\\" und \\"Quartenakkord\\" genau differenziert sind.', 'Eigenschaften des Quartenakkordes.', 'Quartenakkorde klingen etwas „unstet“, da ihnen eine Tendenz zum Verlassen der Tonart eigen ist. Die Quarte ist das Komplementärintervall der Quinte, das heißt, die beiden Intervalle „verschmelzen“ übereinandergeschichtet zur Oktave und führen so wieder in den Ausgangston zurück. Wenn man dem Quintenzirkel in seiner „kadenzierenden“ Richtung (G → C → F → B und so weiter) folgt, bewegt man sich demnach in aufsteigenden Quarten (dies ist der Hauptgrund dafür, dass einige moderne Theoretiker bei vorwiegend harmonischen Betrachtungen lieber vom „Quartenzirkel“ sprechen). Die „eingebaute“ kadenzierende Dynamik des Modells – G wirkt funktional als Dominante nach C, dieses strebt wiederum nach F und so weiter – erklärt, warum Quarten die Eigenschaft haben, jeweils ein neues tonales Zentrum anzudeuten, beziehungsweise zur Ausgangstonalität in recht instabilem Verhältnis zu stehen. Damit eignet sich die Quarte hervorragend für Rückungen, da ihr jeweils die Tendenz innewohnt, zu einer neuen Grundtonart zu verschieben (\\"siehe auch:\\" Modulation (Musik)).', 'Abgrenzungsprobleme.', 'Die Frage, ob auf Quarten beruhende Gebilde aus Sicht der Quartenharmonik interpretiert werden sollten, oder ob es eher sinnvoll ist, sie noch im Rahmen herkömmlicher Systeme wie der Funktionstheorie oder Stufentheorie zu deuten, ist jeweils vom Einzelfall abhängig und manchmal nicht eindeutig zu beantworten. Mitunter können beide Interpretationsansätze sinnvoll sein und zu verschiedenen Ergebnissen führen.', 'Dies wird deutlich, wenn man sich klarmacht, das zum Beispiel der Quartakkord C – F – B im Sinne der herkömmlichen Harmonielehre auch als C-Dur-Septakkord mit kleiner Septime, ausgesparter Quinte und einer durch die Quarte ersetzten Terz (Quartvorhalt), also C7sus4 gesehen werden kann. Andere Deutungen, wie zum Beispiel als Umkehrung (Quartsextakkord) von F7sus4, wären auch denkbar. Selbst aus vier oder mehr Tönen bestehende Quartschichtungen lassen sich in ähnlicher Weise deuten. So könnte man den Quartakkord C – F – B – Es ebenso als c-Moll-Akkord mit kleiner Septime und zusätzlicher Quarte Cm7/4 oder Cm11, oder auch, um nur eine der vielen Möglichkeiten anzudeuten, als Umkehrung eines Es-Dur-Akkordes mit Sekundvorhalt und zusätzlicher Sexte Es6sus2 sehen.', 'Dem an tonales Hören gewöhnten Ohr bieten sich also viele Möglichkeiten, eine Quartschichtung zu interpretieren.

Nach ihrer Rückkehr nach Deutschland planten sie in Vinz’ Verlag eine Nachfolgezeitschrift unter dem Titel \\"Der Ruf – unabhängige Blätter der jungen Generation,\\" die erstmals am 15. August 1946 erschien. Die Zeitschrift druckte auch literarische Texte ab, aber die Herausgeber Andersch und Richter verstanden sie vor allem als politisches Organ, in dem sie für ein freies Deutschland als Brücke zwischen Ost und West und eine sozialistische Gesellschaftsform eintraten. Dabei übten sie auch Kritik an der amerikanischen Besatzungsmacht, was im April 1947 zum Verbot des \\"Rufs\\" durch die Information Control Division der amerikanischen Besatzungszone führte. Erst nach der Absetzung der beiden Herausgeber konnte die Zeitschrift unter Leitung von Erich Kuby und mit veränderter politischer Ausrichtung wieder erscheinen. Sie verlor indessen an Bedeutung und wurde schließlich eingestellt.', 'Nach dem Ende der Tätigkeit beim \\"Ruf\\" plante Hans Werner Richter eine Nachfolgezeitschrift, die er \\"Der Skorpion\\" betiteln wollte. Als eine Art von Redaktionssitzung lud Richter Autoren aus dem Umfeld der geplanten Zeitung am 6. und 7. September 1947 zu einem Treffen am Bannwaldsee bei Füssen ins Haus Ilse Schneider-Lengyels ein. Dort sollten Manuskripte vorgelesen und gemeinsam diskutiert werden. Daneben stand der private und unterhaltende Charakter der Zusammenkunft im Vordergrund. Während die Zeitschrift \\"Der Skorpion\\" nie über ihre Nullnummer herauskam, entwickelte sich aus dem Treffen am Bannwaldsee die erste Tagung der Gruppe 47. Im Hinblick auf die Vorgeschichte behauptete Richter später: „Der Ursprung der Gruppe 47 ist politisch-publizistischer Natur. Nicht Literaten schufen sie, sondern politisch engagierte Publizisten mit literarischen Ambitionen.“', 'Historische Periodisierung.', 'Nach Friedhelm Kröll lässt sich die Geschichte der Gruppe 47 in vier Perioden einteilen:', 'Entstehung und Organisation.', 'Am Treffen beim Bannwaldsee nahmen 16 Personen teil. Zum Auftakt las Wolfdietrich Schnurre seine Kurzgeschichte \\"Das Begräbnis.\\" Danach ergab sich ungeplant die Form von offener, teilweise scharfer, spontan geäußerter Kritik der anderen Teilnehmer, die zum späteren Ritual der Gruppenkritik werden sollte. Auch die Form der Lesung, bei der sich der vortragende Autor stets auf den freien Stuhl neben Richter setzte, scherzhaft „elektrischer Stuhl“ getauft, blieb konstant. Zur wichtigen Maxime wurde, dass der Vortragende sich nicht verteidigen durfte, sowie dass die Kritik der konkreten Texte im Mittelpunkt stand. Grundsatzdiskussionen literarischer oder politischer Art, die die Gruppe hätten spalten können, unterband Richter konsequent. Trotz seiner eigenen Präferenz für die realistische Trümmerliteratur gab es kein literarisches Programm der Gruppe, keine gemeinsame Poetologie und nur wenige Grundsätze, etwa keine faschistischen oder militaristischen Texte zuzulassen.', 'Der Name \\"Gruppe 47\\" entstand erst im Anschluss an das erste Treffen, als Hans Werner Richter plante, die Veranstaltung regelmäßig zu wiederholen. Der Schriftsteller und Kritiker Hans Georg Brenner schlug den Namen in Analogie zur spanischen \\"Generación del 98\\" vor. Richter, der jede Organisationsform der Treffen ablehnte, ob „Verein, Club, Verband, Akademie“ stimmte dem Vorschlag zu: „‚Gruppe 47‘, das ist ja völlig unverbindlich und besagt eigentlich gar nichts.“', 'Erst 1962, zum 15. Jahrestag der Entstehung, formulierte Richter rückblickend die „ideellen Ausgangspunkte“ der Gruppe 47:', 'Wen er zu den Treffen der Gruppe einlud, entschied Richter persönlich: „Es ist mein Freundeskreis. […] jetzt gebe ich einmal im Jahr ein Fest, […] das nennt man die Gruppe 47 […]. Und ich lade alle Leute ein, die mir passen, die mit mir befreundet sind.“ Damit ließ er Einflussnahme von außen auf die später kritisierte Einladungspraxis von vornherein gar nicht zu. Nach Heinz Ludwig Arnold, der mehrfach über die Gruppe 47 publizierte, war die Stärke Richters, der weder als Schriftsteller noch als Kritiker größere Bedeutung erlangt habe und bei seinen beiden eigenen Lesungen in der Kritik der Gruppe durchfiel, sein Organisationstalent. Der Erfolg der Gruppe 47 wurde für Richter zur Lebensaufgabe.', 'Die ersten Jahre.', 'Zwei Monate nach der Auftaktveranstaltung fand das zweite Treffen der Gruppe 47 in Herrlingen bei Ulm statt, bei dem sich die Teilnehmerzahl bereits verdoppelt hatte. Zu den erstmaligen Teilnehmern gehörte Richters Mitstreiter beim \\"Ruf\\" Alfred Andersch, dessen Essay \\"Deutsche Literatur in der Entscheidung\\" für die Gruppe eine programmatische Bedeutung erhielt. Ausgehend von der These, „echte Künstlerschaft“ sei stets „identisch mit der Gegnerschaft zum Nationalsozialismus“, konstatierte Andersch, dass „die junge Generation vor einer tabula rasa“ stehe, „vor der Notwendigkeit, in einem originalen Schöpfungsakt eine Erneuerung des deutschen geistigen Lebens zu vollbringen.“ Anderschs Zukunftsentwurf blieb für lange Zeit der einzige Essay, der in der Gruppe gelesen wurde.', 'Die Treffen fanden in den Folgejahren zumeist halbjährlich im Frühjahr und Herbst an wechselnden Orten statt. Auf der siebten Tagung 1950 in Inzigkofen wurde erstmals der \\"Preis der Gruppe 47\\" ins Leben gerufen, der im Unterschied zu den etablierten Literaturpreisen als Förderpreis für noch unbekannte Autoren gedacht war. Franz Joseph Schneider, der seit dem Vorjahr der Gruppe angehörte, hatte eine Spende von 1000 DM beschafft. Nach Abschluss der Lesungen kürten die anwesenden Mitglieder der Gruppe den Preisträger in einer demokratischen Wahl. Als Erster wurde der Lyriker Günter Eich ausgezeichnet. Er war mit dem dritten Treffen in Jugenheim zur Gruppe gestoßen und galt in den Anfangsjahren als ihr profiliertester Autor. In den folgenden Jahren organisierte Richter Preisgelder unterschiedlicher Höhe bei Verlagen und Rundfunkanstalten, vergab sie aber nur unregelmäßig. Ob bei der jeweiligen Tagung ein Preis ausgelobt wurde, gab er den Teilnehmern erst zum Abschluss bekannt.', 'Durch Empfehlungen Dritter, jedoch stets erst mittels persönlicher Einladung durch Hans Werner Richter kamen immer neue Autoren zu den Treffen der Gruppe 47. So debütierte im Jahr 1951 bei der Tagung in Bad Dürkheim auf Vorschlag Alfred Anderschs Heinrich Böll, der zu diesem Zeitpunkt zwar schon zwei Erzählungen und einen Roman veröffentlicht hatte, allerdings ohne dass diese auf breite Resonanz gestoßen waren.

Rolf Schroers urteilte nach der Einstellung: „\\"Die Literatur\\" war ein rohes, oft wüstes Blatt, unausgeglichen, marktschreierisch,“ und enthalte „blasses Zeug mehr als genug […], schlecht gezielte Angriffe, aber man nahm die Zeit wütend ernst.“', 'Realismus und Moderne.', 'Mit steigender Bekanntheit der Gruppe wurden vermehrt Gäste aus dem In- und Ausland zu den Tagungen eingeladen. Das 10. Treffen fand im Mai 1952 in Niendorf statt, maßgeblich unterstützt von Ernst Schnabel, dem Intendanten des Hamburger Funkhauses des Nordwestdeutschen Rundfunk (NWDR). Dort trug Paul Celan neben anderen Gedichten seine noch unbekannte \\"Todesfuge\\" vor und wurde nach Bölls nachträglicher Einschätzung „auf die peinlichste Weise mißverstanden“. Walter Jens erinnerte sich an die Reaktionen: „Als Celan zum ersten Mal auftrat, da sagte man: ‚Das kann doch kaum jemand hören!‘, er las sehr pathetisch. Wir haben darüber gelacht, ‚Der liest ja wie Goebbels!‘, sagte einer. […] Die \\"Todesfuge\\" war ja ein Reinfall in der Gruppe! Das war eine völlig andere Welt, da kamen die Neorealisten nicht mit.“ Milo Dor fügte den Ausspruch Richters hinzu, Celan habe „in einem Singsang vorgelesen wie in einer Synagoge“. In einem Brief an seine Frau Gisèle kommentierte Celan, Richter sei ein „Initiator eines Realismus, der nicht einmal erste Wahl ist“, und schloss: „Jene also, die die Poesie nicht mögen – sie waren in der Mehrzahl – lehnten sich auf.“ Trotz solcher Stimmen machte Celan mit dem Auftritt auf sich aufmerksam. Noch auf der Tagung erhielt er das Angebot für einen ersten Gedichtband in einem deutschen Verlag, und bei der abschließenden Wahl zum Preis der Gruppe erreichte er immerhin den dritten Rang. An weiteren Treffen der Gruppe 47 nahm er aber trotz wiederholter Einladungen nicht mehr teil.', 'Die Tagung in Niendorf führte nach Einschätzung Arnolds zu einem literarischen Paradigmenwechsel in der Gruppe: der schlichte Realismus der Trümmerliteratur, der in den Anfangsjahren bestimmend gewesen war, wich allmählich komplexeren Texten.

Sie bieten zusammengerechnet bis zu 1249 Zuschauern Platz. Im Bereich des Musiktheaters arbeitet das Theater seit 1917 mit dem bereits 1820 gegründeten Orchester Bremer Philharmoniker zusammen, an dem es zu 22 % beteiligt ist. Internationale Bekanntheit erlangte das Theater ab 1962 während der Intendanz Kurt Hübners, der mit innovativen und avantgardistischen Schauspielproduktionen den „Bremer Stil“ prägte und das Theater zu einem Experimentierlabor der deutschen Kulturlandschaft machte.', 'Geschichte.', 'Ein neues Theater in der Stadt (1910–1933).', 'Das dominierende Theater in Bremen war über Jahrzehnte das Stadttheater in den Wallanlagen. Nach einem Intendantenwechsel verlagerte sich dessen Aufführungsschwerpunkt signifikant auf das Musiktheater, sodass dem Schauspiel in der Hansestadt kaum noch eine Bühne geboten wurde. Aus diesem Grund entschlossen sich der gelernte Journalist und Autor Johannes Wiegand (* 1874; † 1940) und der Theaterwissenschaftler Eduard Ichon (* 1879; † 1943) dazu, ein eigenes, ausschließlich dem Schauspiel gewidmetes Theater aufzubauen. Zu diesem Zweck erwarben sie im Jahr 1909 die Tonhalle am Neustadtswall auf der linken Weserseite. Der Architekt Joseph Ostwald baute das Gebäude im Frühjahr 1910 zu einem Schauspielhaus um, dessen schlichte Fassade von sechs rechteckigen Pilastern dominiert wurde. In der neuen, als Personalgesellschaft geführten Spielstätte wurden vornehmlich moderne Inszenierungen dargeboten, die die Bremer überaus positiv aufnahmen.', 'Ichon und Wiegand erkannten bald, dass sich Möglichkeiten boten, ein größeres Theater mit höheren Kapazitäten zu errichten. Man entschied sich für den Standort östlich der Wallanlagen und beauftragte die Architekten August Abbehusen und Otto Blendermann mit der Konstruktion der neuen Spielstätte. Sie konzipierten ein Theater im neoklassizistischen Stil, das heutige Theater am Goetheplatz. Es dominierten sechs Säulen vor einer ruhigen zurückgesetzten Mauerfront die Frontfassade und trugen den Giebel, hinter dem sich das Dach erhob. Am Giebel wurde ein Relief des Künstlers Ernst von Wachold installiert. Diese wenige Meter zurückliegende Wand schuf auf Höhe des ersten Stockwerkes einen die Säulen einbeziehenden Balkon mit großen weiten Fenstern, durch die Sonnenlicht in die Flure fluten konnte. Die neue Spielstätte, deren Gestaltung in Fachkreisen viel Anerkennung erhielt, war äußerlich imposant, tatsächlich jedoch architektonisch sehr schlicht gehalten. Die Bühne maß 18 Meter in der Breite und 17 Meter in der Tiefe. Die Eröffnung des Schauspielhauses, das im Parkett und auf zwei Rängen 804 Zuschauern Platz bot, fand am 15. August 1913 statt, als Johannes Wiegand Oscar Wildes Schauspiel \\"Eine Frau ohne Bedeutung\\" inszenierte.', 'Ichon und Wiegand führten das neue Theater als \\"Bremer Schauspielhaus GmbH\\" und setzten sich zum Ziel, einen Gegensatz zu den vorherrschenden Richtungen des Wagner-Theaters, der Grand opéra und des Theaters der Repräsentation wie beispielsweise am Burgtheater zu schaffen. Man orientierte sich eher am Goethe-Theater mit psychologischem Drama und zwischenmenschlichen Diskursen. Die Schriftsteller Hermann Bahr, Herbert Eulenberg und Rudolf Presber veröffentlichten anlässlich der Einweihung der neuen Spielstätte eine Erklärung:', 'In den Folgejahren wurden zahlreiche junge Schauspieler zum Kriegsdienst im Ersten Weltkrieg eingezogen; es gelang jedoch, die Vorstellungsausfälle durch vermehrte Gastspiele anderer Theater zu kompensieren. Noch bis 1917 bespielte man auch das alte Haus am Neustadtswall, welches dann allerdings aufgegeben wurde. Im gleichen Jahr führten die beiden Theaterleiter am Schauspielhaus komische Singspiele ein, die ebenfalls viel Publikum lockten. Die dadurch erzielten Einnahmen sicherten das eigentliche künstlerische Schauspielprogramm.', 'Nach dem Ende des Krieges beschlossen Wiegand und Ichon, jede Spielzeit mit einem Leitgedanken zu überschreiben, dem sich alle Stücke unterzuordnen haben. Für die Spielzeit 1918/1919 wählte man den Titel „Das Individuum und die Gesellschaft im Drama der europäischen Völker der letzten Jahrzehnte“. Um auch in den wirtschaftlich schweren Nachkriegsjahren die Einnahmen konstant zu halten, wurde die Idee des Gemeinschaftstheaters entwickelt. Dieses Projekt, das das Theater allen Schichten und Kreisen der Bevölkerung zugänglich machen sollte, realisierte man in Kooperation und mit dem Goethe-Bund. Mit Hilfe organisierter Besuche und Abonnements schuf man sich eine feste Besuchergemeinde, deren Geld das Theater aufbaute und dauerhaft stützte. Eine entsprechende Offerte wurde unter dem Titel „Abonnements mit Gemeinschaftscharakter“ veröffentlicht:', 'Das Schauspielhaus etablierte sich als Theater, dessen zahlreiche Uraufführungen als wagemutig galten. Ichon und Wiegand bevorzugten die neuere und zeitgemäße Dramatik und nahmen zahlreiche Stücke von bekannten Gegenwartsdramatikern in die Spielpläne auf. Die hohe Qualität der Aufführungen und die hohe Besucherauslastung führten dazu, dass die Spielstätte autark und rentabel weiterbetrieben werden konnte, wohingegen das Stadttheater auf Subventionen in Höhe von 600.000 Reichsmark angewiesen war. Zum Ensemble des Schauspielhauses zählten in den Jahren der Weimarer Republik unter anderem Hans Söhnker, Gustaf Gründgens, Albert Bassermann, Paul Wegener, Käthe Dorsch, Fritz Kortner, Heinz Rühmann, Bernhard Wicki, Willy Fritsch, Tilla Durieux, Lil Dagover und Emil Jannings. Als Oberspielleiter fungierte zwischen 1923 und 1929 der spätere Hollywoodregisseur Douglas Sirk. Ab etwa 1920 wurden vermehrt auch expressionistische Werke mit sozialkritischen Inhalten aufgeführt, die jedoch in der bremischen Kulturlandschaft und bei den Zuschauern zunächst eher auf Kritik und Befremden stießen – so geschehen etwa 1918 bei Georg Kaisers \\"Gas\\". Nach einigen Jahren erhielt die Stilrichtung allerdings auch am Schauspielhaus Anerkennung. Häufig gespielt wurden am Schauspielhaus auch die Stücke des Literaturnobelpreisträgers Gerhart Hauptmann, von denen mindestens eines in nahezu jeder Spielzeit zum Repertoire des Ensembles zählte. Der Schriftsteller erfreute sich in der Bremer Bevölkerung und unter den Theaterbesuchern großer Beliebtheit und aus Anlass seines bevorstehenden 60. Geburtstages veranstaltete man am 3. September 1922 eine Morgenfeier mit Reichspräsident Friedrich Ebert als Ehrengast. Gespielt wurde Hauptmanns Drama \\"Die Jungfern vom Bischofsberg\\" und der Autor urteilte über die Inszenierung, dass diese in ihm eine „weit über hauptstädtische Erfahrungen hinausgehende Befriedigung“ hervorgerufen habe.', '1930 feierte man das zwanzigjährige Bestehen des Schauspielhauses. Während dieser Zeit waren 758 verschiedene Werke in insgesamt 7001 Vorstellungen dargeboten worden. Zum Jubiläum gratulierten unter anderem Leopold Jessner und Carl Zuckmayer. Gerhart Hauptmann schrieb', 'und auch Thomas Mann sprach Ichon und Wiegand seine tiefe Anerkennung aus:', 'Die Zeit des Nationalsozialismus (1933–1945).', 'Nach der Machtübernahme durch die Nationalsozialisten wurde es problematisch, den Theaterbetrieb aufrechtzuerhalten. Bereits 1933 musste jeder Künstler bei den politisch Verantwortlichen eine Arbeitserlaubnis beantragen. Ichon und Wiegand sahen sich gezwungen, den langjährigen Oberregisseur Wilhelm Chmelnitzky auf Grund seines jüdischen Glaubens zu beurlauben. \\"Chmel\\", wie er genannt wurde, war nach einer Gastinszenierung (\\"Der Frauenarzt\\") von 1930 bis 1933 am Theater.', 'Die beiden Gründer der Spielstätte lehnten die Ideologie der Machthaber im Geiste konsequent ab. Sie hatten sich vorgenommen, das Schauspielhaus als privates Theater weiterzuführen – im Gegensatz zum Stadttheater, das kurz nach Regierungsantritt der NSDAP verstaatlicht worden war. Die Spielpläne wurden ohne Einbeziehung bekannter nationalsozialistischer Autoren, deren Werke an anderen Bühnen immer häufiger aufgeführt wurden, gestaltet. Zwar kamen keine verbotenen Stücke zur Aufführung, doch bewegte man sich stets am Rand des gerade noch Erlaubten, indem man Stücke geschickt umschrieb oder von der deutschlandfreundlichen Gesinnung ausländischer Autoren profitierte. Es gab jedoch auch Ausnahmefälle, in denen tatsächlich missliebige Werke zur Aufführung kamen. So feierte im Mai 1936 \\"Wasser für Canitoga\\" Premiere, ein Schauspiel des 1933 inhaftierten und im Jahr der Aufführung zur Emigration gezwungenen Hans José Rehfisch. Attila Hörbiger übernahm eine Gastrolle in der Inszenierung. Knapp drei Jahre später, im Mai 1939, gelang es Wiegand und Ichon, \\"Die guten Feinde\\" von Günther Weißenborn auf die Bühne zu bringen, der seit 1937 in Berlin der Roten Kapelle angehörte. Ebenfalls zur Aufführung kam \\"Das lebenslängliche Kind\\" von Robert Neuner. Hinter diesem Autorenpseudonym verbarg sich Erich Kästner, dessen Werke 1933 im Zuge der Bücherverbrennung vernichtet wurden.', 'Franz Reichert, der von 1936 bis 1941 als Regisseur und Spielleiter in Bremen tätig war, schrieb später in seiner Autobiografie, dass die Spielstätte das „einzige Theater“ gewesen sei, in dem es „weder ein Hitler- noch ein Goebbelsportrait gegeben hat“. Das Leitungsduo beschrieb er folgendermaßen:', 'Reichert fügte außerdem an, dass man im Theater die „Nazis mit der Laterne suchen“ musste. Statt der Porträts der Machthaber fand sich im Foyer des Schauspielhauses das Gemälde \\"Rote Pferde\\" von Franz Marc, dessen Bilder die Nationalsozialisten zur Entarteten Kunst zählten.', 'Das Bremer Theater fungierte innerhalb der Stadt also als eine Art liberale Insel. Offeneren Widerstand wagten Ichon und Wiegand jedoch nicht und mussten zudem stets mit den politisch Verantwortlichen kooperieren, um die Selbstständigkeit zu sichern. So versuchte man sich durch offizielle Schreiben und Sympathiebekundungen anzubiedern. Insbesondere Wiegand besaß ein Talent der Täuschung, welches ihm hinter vorgehaltener Hand alsbald den Spitznamen „lebender Lügenbaron“ einbrachte.

Prägende geographische Merkmale sind die markante Verengung des Stroms, die der Stadt ihren Namen gegeben hat, sowie das über dem Strom rund hundert Meter steil aufragende Hochplateau Colline de Québec, auf dem sich das Stadtzentrum befindet.', 'Ursprünglich lebten hier die Sankt-Lorenz-Irokesen im Dorf Stadacona. 1543 scheiterte ein erster von Jacques Cartier geleiteter französischer Kolonialisierungsversuch. Am 3. Juli 1608 gründete der Seefahrer Samuel de Champlain einen Handelsposten, aus dem sich die spätere Stadt entwickelte. Drei Jahre nach der Eroberung durch englische Abenteurer gelangte Québec 1632 zurück in französischen Besitz. Weitere englische bzw. britische Eroberungsversuche in den Jahren 1690 und 1711 schlugen fehl. 1759 gelang es den Briten schließlich, nach einer zweieinhalb Monate langen Belagerung und der Schlacht auf der Abraham-Ebene die Stadt einzunehmen. 1867 wurde Québec zu einer Provinzhauptstadt im neuen kanadischen Staat. In der zweiten Hälfte des 19. Jahrhunderts verlor die Stadt ihren Status als führendes Wirtschaftszentrum an Montreal und stagnierte mehrere Jahrzehnte. Im Verlaufe des 20. Jahrhunderts entwickelte sich Québec zum unbestrittenen Zentrum des Ostens der Provinz.', 'Architektonisch gilt Québec als die europäischste Stadt Nordamerikas, zurückzuführen auf die gut erhaltene Altstadt mit zahlreichen Gebäuden überwiegend französischer Prägung, deren Erbauung bis ins 17. Jahrhundert zurückreichen. Der obere Teil der Altstadt ist von Stadtmauern umgeben, die durch eine Zitadelle ergänzt werden. Québec ist heute die einzige befestigte Stadt Amerikas nördlich von Mexiko. 1985 erklärte die UNESCO die Altstadt und die Befestigungsanlagen zum Welterbe.', 'Mit 531.902 Einwohnern (2016) ist Québec die zweitgrößte Stadt der Provinz und die elftgrößte Kanadas. Diesen Status erreichte sie 2002, als sich die Bevölkerung durch die Eingemeindung mehrerer Vororte verdreifachte. 93,8 % der Bevölkerung sind französischsprachig. Die Metropolregion Communauté métropolitaine de Québec, die die südlich des Sankt-Lorenz-Stroms gelegene Stadt Lévis einschließt, zählt 812.205 Einwohner (2017). Wirtschaftlich dominierend ist der Dienstleistungssektor, wobei die öffentliche Verwaltung überdurchschnittlich stark vertreten ist. Auch der Tourismus ist von großer Bedeutung.

Der Strom ist oberhalb der Stadt zweieinhalb bis drei Kilometer breit und verengt sich im Bereich des Stadtzentrums auf etwas mehr als einen Kilometer. Anschließend teilt er sich in zwei Arme, welche die Île d’Orléans umgeben. Nach dieser Insel beginnt der über 350 km lange und bis zu 60 km breite Sankt-Lorenz-Ästuar. Da die Rinne die Fließgeschwindigkeit stark erhöht und die Gezeiten aufgrund des geringen Höhenunterschieds zum Atlantischen Ozean noch deutlich spürbar sind (1,8 bis 3,1 m Unterschied zwischen Ebbe und Flut), ist der Engpass von Québec eine für die Schifffahrt anspruchsvolle Stelle.', 'Wichtigster Nebenfluss ist der vollständig auf Stadtgebiet liegende Rivière Saint-Charles. Er entspringt im Lac Saint-Charles am nördlichen Stadtrand, zieht sich – vor allem im Oberlauf stark mäandrierend – in Richtung Südosten und mündet nach 35 Kilometern in den Sankt-Lorenz-Strom. Sein Einzugsgebiet, das mehrere weitere Flüsse umfasst, ist das am dichtesten besiedelte in der Provinz Québec. Ein kleiner Teil des Stadtgebiets im äußersten Nordwesten gehört zum Einzugsgebiet des Rivière Jacques-Cartier. Der Unterlauf des Rivière Montmorency bildet die östliche Stadtgrenze, der Südwesten der Stadt wird durch den Rivière du Cap Rouge und den Lac Saint-Augustin entwässert. Auf dem 454,1 km² großen Stadtgebiet gibt es insgesamt 230 Stillgewässer und 695 km Fließgewässer.', 'Topographie und Geologie.', 'Auf dem Stadtgebiet treffen drei geologische Regionen fast aufeinander und sind nur wenige Kilometer voneinander entfernt. Entlang dem Nordufer des Sankt-Lorenz-Stroms erhebt sich die Colline de Québec. Dieses 13 Kilometer lange und ein bis vier Kilometer breite Hochplateau war für die Entstehung und Entwicklung der Stadt von entscheidender Bedeutung. Es reicht vom Cap Rouge im Westen bis zum Cap Diamant nahe der Mündung des Rivière Saint-Charles. Das Plateau, das eine Höhe von 110 Metern erreicht (rund hundert Meter über dem umliegenden Gelände), wird von Felshängen begrenzt, die vor allem zum Strom hin steil abfallen. Bei der Colline de Québec handelt es sich um einen der wenigen nördlich des Stroms gelegenen Ausläufer der Appalachen. Der Sockel besteht aus Sandstein und Tonstein, an den Felsvorsprüngen ist Schiefer zu finden.', 'Das breite, flache Tal des Rivière Saint-Charles ist zusammen mit den angrenzenden Terrassen von Charlesbourg und Beauport Bestandteil des Sankt-Lorenz-Tieflandes. Dort haben sich Sedimentschichten mit einer Dicke von bis zu 60 Metern abgelagert – hauptsächlich Sand und Kies, gelegentlich auch Torf. Vor etwa 11.500 bis 9800 Jahren, in der Endphase der letzten Kaltzeit, lag das Tiefland unter dem Meeresspiegel im Champlainmeer. Dieser seichte Meeresarm des Atlantischen Ozeans verschwand aufgrund der fortschreitenden postglazialen Landhebung. Dabei wurden große Mengen an Sedimenten abgelagert und es bildeten sich zunächst Inseln (darunter die Colline de Québec). Vor rund 9000 Jahren trat ein Süßwassersee an die Stelle des Champlainmeers, der Lac Lampsilis. Dieser bestand etwa 2300 Jahre lang und wich dem Vorläufer des Sankt-Lorenz-Stroms. Seit rund 3000 Jahren entspricht der Strom ungefähr seiner heutigen Gestalt.', 'Im nördlichen Drittel des Stadtgebiets liegen Ausläufer der Laurentinischen Berge. Sie sind Teil des Kanadischen Schilds, einem riesigen Gebiet mit sehr altem magmatischem Gestein. Die Laurentinischen Berge sind stark erodierte Reste der Grenville-Gebirgsbildung, die sich während des Mesoproterozoikums vor rund 1 bis 1,6 Milliarden Jahren ereignete. Vorherrschend ist Anorthosit, das von Feldspat durchzogen ist. Überdeckt wird dieses dunkle Gestein von Kies- und Sandablagerungen, eine Hinterlassenschaft der Vergletscherungen. Höchste Erhebung der Stadt ist der 485 Meter hohe Mont Bélair. Eine markante Schichtstufe prägt den Übergang zwischen Kanadischem Schild und dem Sankt-Lorenz-Tiefland. So ergießt sich der Rivière Saint-Charles über den 28 Meter hohen Wasserfall Kabir Kouba \\"(Chute Kabir Kouba)\\". Ganz im Osten, wo die Schichtstufe bis fast an den Sankt-Lorenz-Strom heranreicht, überwindet der Rivière Montmorency den 83 Meter hohen Montmorency-Fall \\"(Chute Montmorency)\\", den höchsten Wasserfall der Provinz.', 'Nachbargemeinden.', 'Nachbargemeinden sind Saint-Augustin-de-Desmaures und Sainte-Catherine-de-la-Jacques-Cartier im Westen, Shannon und Saint-Gabriel-de-Valcartier im Nordwesten, Stoneham-et-Tewkesbury, Lac-Delage und Lac-Beauport im Norden sowie Sainte-Brigitte-de-Laval und Boischatel im Nordosten. Auf der gegenüberliegenden Seite des Sankt-Lorenz-Stroms, im Süden, liegt die Stadt Lévis.

An einzelnen Tagen können die Temperaturen auch weit über 30 Grad Celsius steigen, wobei durchgehend eine relativ hohe Luftfeuchtigkeit herrscht. Der Winter ist von sehr kaltem, schneereichem und windigem Wetter geprägt, bei länger anhaltenden Frostperioden unter −20 °C. Frühling und Herbst sind mild, es können aber starke Temperaturschwankungen auftreten. Die jährliche Niederschlagsmenge beträgt rund 1190 mm. In den Monaten November bis April fällt durchschnittlich etwa 303 cm Schnee, wobei an 110 Tagen die Schneedecke mehr als 20 cm dick ist. Die Sonnenscheindauer beträgt jährlich 1916 Stunden.

Ihre besondere Rolle war auch den Geschwistern bewusst, so erinnert sich ihr Bruder Golo: „Die Eri muß die Suppe salzen.“ Dieser Spruch über die Zwölfjährige aus dem Jahr 1917 wurde zu einer oft gebrauchten Redewendung der Familie Mann.', 'Nach Erika folgte der Bruder Klaus, mit dem sie zeitlebens eng verbunden war – sie traten „wie Zwillinge“ auf, und Klaus Mann beschrieb ihre Zusammengehörigkeit mit den Worten „unsere Solidarität war absolut und ohne Vorbehalt“. Die vier jüngeren Geschwister waren Golo, Monika, Elisabeth und Michael. Die Kinder wuchsen in München auf.

Im Mai 1921 wechselte sie zum Münchner Luisengymnasium. Zusammen mit Klaus und befreundeten Nachbarskindern, zu denen auch die Töchter Bruno Walters, Gretel und Lotte, sowie Ricki Hallgarten, Sohn einer jüdischen Intellektuellenfamilie, gehörten, gründete sie 1919 eine ambitionierte Schauspieltruppe, den \\"Laienbund Deutscher Mimiker\\". Noch als Schülerin am Münchner Luisengymnasium stand sie nach einem Engagement von Max Reinhardt das erste Mal auf der Bühne des Deutschen Theaters in Berlin. Die zum Teil boshaften Streiche, die sie in der sogenannten „Herzogpark-Bande“ mit Klaus und befreundeten Nachbarskindern anstellte, veranlassten die Eltern, sie und ihren Bruder Klaus in einem Internat der Reformpädagogik, der Bergschule Hochwaldhausen im hohen Vogelsberg in Oberhessen, unterrichten zu lassen. Von April bis Juli 1922 war sie dort; anschließend kehrte Erika Mann an das Luisengymnasium zurück. 1924 bestand sie ihr Abitur, allerdings mit schlechten Noten.

Pamela Wedekind löste 1928 die Verlobung mit Klaus Mann und heiratete im April 1930 Carl Sternheim, den Vater der gemeinsamen Freundin von Erika und Klaus Mann, Dorothea Sternheim, genannt „Mopsa“, die Bühnenbild und Kostüme von \\"Revue zu Vieren\\" entworfen hatte.', 'In einer Art von Flucht brachen Erika und Klaus Mann am 7. Oktober 1927 von Rotterdam aus zu einer mehrmonatigen Weltreise bis Juli 1928 auf, die beide über die USA, Japan, Korea, China und die Sowjetunion rund um den Globus führte.

Mit dem Namen \\"The Literary Mann Twins\\" präsentierten die Geschwister sich als Zwillinge, um damit weitere Aufmerksamkeit zu erregen. Ein Schwerpunkt ihrer Reise war Hollywood, doch ihre Hoffnung, dort als künftiger Filmstar oder Drehbuchautor entdeckt zu werden, erfüllte sich nicht.

He was on a rotation at a VA hospital in Massachusetts in 1968 when a man in his sixties came in needing a relatively simple gallbladder operation. The man, whose name was James DeAngelo, already had a large scar across his abdomen, which he said was from a longago operation to remove a stomach tumor. He had also had metastatic tumors that had spread to his liver, he added, but the surgeons had not touched those. Rosenberg was sure that his patient was confused. It would have been a miracle if he had survived even six months with metastatic stomach cancer. But according to DeAngelo’s hospital records, that was exactly what had happened. Twelve years earlier, he had walked into the same hospital complaining of malaise and low energy. At the time, his chart noted, he was drinking his way through three or four bottles of whiskey per week and smoking a pack or two of cigarettes every day. Surgeons had discovered a fist-sized tumor in his stomach and smaller metastatic tumors in his liver. They removed the stomach tumor, along with half of his stomach, but they left the liver tumors alone, deciding that it was too risky to try to remove them at the same time. And then they had sewn him up and sent him home to die, which he had obviously failed to do. Rosenberg went ahead with the gallbladder operation, and while he was in there he decided to take a look around in DeAngelo’s abdomen. He felt behind the liver, gingerly working his way under its soft purple lobes, expecting to feel lumps of remnant tumors—an unmistakable feeling, hard and round, almost alien-like—but he found absolutely no trace of any growths. “This man had had a virulent and untreatable cancer that should have killed him quickly,” Rosenberg wrote in his 1992 book The Transformed Cell. “He had received no treatment whatsoever for his disease from us or from anyone else. And he had been cured.” How could this be? In all the medical literature, Rosenberg could find only four instances of complete and spontaneous remission of metastatic stomach cancer. He was mystified. But he eventually came up with a hypothesis: he believed that DeAngelo’s own immune system had fought off the cancer and killed the remaining tumors in his liver, the way you or I might shake off a cold. His own body had cured his cancer. Somehow. At the time, this notion was well out of the mainstream of cancer research. But Rosenberg suspected that he was onto something important. The Transformed Cell told the story of Rosenberg’s quest to harness the immune system to fight cancer. Despite small successes peppered here and there, however, whatever phenomenon had erased James DeAngelo’s tumors proved to be elusive; for the first ten years, not a single one of Rosenberg’s patients had survived. Not one. But still he kept at it. He was doing better as a cancer surgeon than a cancer researcher: he operated on President Ronald Reagan in 1985, removing cancerous polyps from his colon, and that had gone fine. But Rosenberg’s goal was to eliminate the need for cancer surgeries, period. Finally, in the mid-1980s, he had a glimmer of success—just enough to keep him going. — As soon as I read The Transformed Cell, as a medical student, I knew that I wanted to be a surgical oncologist and that I had to work with Steve Rosenberg. Cancer had been on my mind since before I had even applied to medical school. During my postbac year, while taking med school prerequisite courses, I volunteered on the pediatric cancer ward of Kingston General Hospital in Ontario, spending time with kids who were undergoing cancer treatment. Thankfully, childhood leukemia is one area where Medicine 2.0 has made real progress. But not all the kids survived, and the bravery of these children, the pain that they and their parents endured, and the compassion of their medical teams moved me more deeply than any engineering or mathematical problem. It confirmed my decision to switch from engineering to medicine. In my third year of medical school, I got the opportunity to spend four months in Rosenberg’s lab, at the epicenter of American cancer research. By the time I arrived, it had been nearly three decades since Richard Nixon had declared a national War on Cancer in 1971. Initially, the hope was that cancer would be “cured” within five years, in time for the Bicentennial. Yet it remained stubbornly undefeated in 1976, and still by the time I finished medical school in 2001. And today, for all intents and purposes. Source: National Cancer Institute (2021). Despite well over 100 billion spent on research via the National Cancer Institute, plus many billions more from private industry and public charities— despite all the pink ribbons and yellow bracelets, and literally millions of published papers on the PubMed database—cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, right behind heart disease. Together, these two conditions account for almost one in every two American deaths. The difference is that we understand the genesis and progression of heart disease fairly well, and we have some effective tools with which to prevent and treat it. As a result, mortality rates from cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease have dropped by two-thirds since the middle of the twentieth century. But cancer still kills Americans at almost exactly the same rate as it did fifty years ago. We have made some progress against a few specific cancers, notably leukemia (especially childhood leukemia, as I noted earlier). For adults with leukemia, ten-year survival rates nearly doubled between 1975 and 2000, leaping from 23 percent to 44 percent. Survival rates for Hodgkin’s and nonHodgkin’s lymphomas have increased as well, especially the former. Yet these represent relatively small victories in a “war” that has not gone particularly well. Like heart disease, cancer is a disease of aging. That is, it becomes exponentially more prevalent with each decade of life, as figure 6 shows. But it can be deadly at almost any age, especially middle age. The median age of a cancer diagnosis is sixty-six, but in 2017 there were more cancer deaths among people between forty-five and sixty-four than from heart disease, liver disease, and stroke combined. This year, if recent trends continue, that same age group will also account for nearly 40 percent of the estimated 1.7 million new cases of cancer that are likely to be diagnosed in the United States, according to the National Cancer Institute. By the time cancer is detected, however, it has probably already been progressing for years and possibly decades. As I write these words, I reflect sadly on three of my friends from high school who died of cancer in the past ten years, all younger than fortyfive. I was able to say goodbye to only one of them before she died. Everyone reading this book probably has a few similar stories. The problem we face is that once cancer is established, we lack highly effective treatments for it. Our toolbox is limited. Many (though not all) solid tumors can be removed surgically, a tactic that dates back to ancient Egypt. Combining surgery and radiation therapy is pretty effective against most local, solid-tumor cancers. But while we’ve gotten fairly good at this approach, we have essentially maxed out our ability to treat cancers this way. We are not getting any more juice from the squeeze. And surgery is of limited value when cancer has metastasized, or spread. Metastatic cancers can be slowed by chemotherapy, but they virtually always come back, often more resistant to treatment than ever. Our benchmark for success in a patient, or remission, is typically five-year survival, nothing more. We don’t dare utter the word cure. The second problem is that our ability to detect cancer at an early stage remains very weak. Far too often, we discover tumors only when they cause other symptoms, by which point they are often too locally advanced to be removed—or worse, the cancer has already spread to other parts of the body. I saw this happen many times during my training: we would remove a patient’s tumor (or tumors), only to have them die a year later because that same cancer had taken hold elsewhere, like their liver or their lungs.\\"","completion":"The article discusses the challenges of treating cancer, particularly the lack of effective treatments and early detection methods.

Die Art kommt in Amerika vor, wobei der Verbreitungsschwerpunkt der Süden Nordamerikas und Mittelamerika darstellen, während das Vorkommen der Spinne nach Süden hin in Venezuela endet. Dort bewohnt sie ihrer Xerothermophilie entsprechend überwiegend trockenwarme Habitate (Lebensräume). Der Trivialname der Grünen Luchsspinne beruht auf der auffälligen Grünfärbung, die sie allerdings mit anderen Vertretern der Gattung \\"Peucetia\\" teilt. Mit einer maximalen Körperlänge von 21,6 Millimetern im Normalzustand als Weibchen ist die Art die größte in Nordamerika vorkommende Luchsspinne.', 'Die wie alle Luchsspinnen tagaktive Grüne Luchsspinne legt ebenfalls nach Eigenart der Familie kein Spinnennetz für den Beutefang an, sondern erlegt Beutetiere entweder als aktiver Hetz- oder als Lauerjäger. Das Beutespektrum setzt sich aus anderen Gliederfüßern zusammen, wobei die Größe der Beutetiere die des Jägers deutlich übertreffen können. Die Art ist außerdem für eine als besonders geltende Methode der Abwehr gegenüber Prädatoren (Fressfeinden) bekannt. Sie ist zwecks der Verteidigung neben einem Abwehrbiss auch dazu in der Lage, Gift aus ihren Cheliceren (Kieferklauen) über mehrere Zentimeter zu versprühen. Bisher wurde dieses Verhalten jedoch nur von Weibchen beobachtet, die einen Eikokon oder Jungtiere bewachen. Der Paarung der Grünen Luchsspinne geht, wie es bei Wolfspinnenartigen (Lycosoidea) die Regel ist, ein ausgeprägtes Balzverhalten voraus. Das Weibchen betreibt eine für Spinnen ausgeprägte Brutpflege, verteidigt seine Eikokons und betreut für kurze Zeit auch seine daraus geschlüpften Nachkommen. Letztere verbleiben noch für wenige Tage beim Muttertier, ehe sie sich mittels des sogenannten Spinnenflugs ausbreiten. Die Jungtiere wachsen dann – wie für Spinnen üblich – über mehrere Fresshäute (Häutungsstadien) heran.', 'Bisse der Grünen Luchsspinne beim Menschen sind belegt. Der Biss gilt zwar als schmerzhaft, ruft in der Regel jedoch keine medizinischen Komplikationen hervor. Die Art verhält sich für gewöhnlich gegenüber dem Menschen nicht aggressiv, wobei begattete Weibchen oder solche, die einen Eikokon oder Nachkommen bewachen, eine Ausnahme bilden. Auch das Verteidigen mittels des Verspritzens von Gift gegen Menschen ist belegt, ist jedoch auch nicht weiter gefährlich, ausgenommen, es gelangt in das Auge, wo es reizend wirkt und die Sehfähigkeit für wenige Tage einschränken kann. In der Grünen Luchsspinne wird teilweise ein Nützling im Rahmen der biologischen Schädlingsbekämpfung gesehen, da das Beutespektrum der Art auch landwirtschaftliche Schädlinge umfasst. Dieser Nutzen ist jedoch umstritten, da sich die Spinne als opportunistischer Jäger nicht auf Schädlinge spezialisiert, sondern auch andere Nützlinge erlegt.', 'Merkmale.', 'Die Körperlänge des Weibchens der Grünen Luchsspinne kann unbefruchtet zwischen 11,8 und 21,6 Millimeter betragen, während sie beim Männchen zwischen 8,3 und 14,5 Millimetern liegt. Im Durchschnitt ist das Weibchen mit 16,2 Millimetern somit größer als das Männchen mit 11,9 Millimetern. Nach einer Befruchtung kann die Körperlänge des Weibchens auf gut 26 Millimeter infolge der im Opisthosoma (Hinterleib) heranreifenden Eier ansteigen. Die Beinspannweite beläuft sich beim Weibchen maximal auf 70 und beim Männchen auf 65 Millimeter. Damit handelt es sich bei der Art um den größten in Nordamerika vorkommenden Vertreter der Luchsspinnen (Oxyopidae). Der grundsätzliche Körperbau der Grünen Luchsspinne gleicht dem anderer Arten der Gattung \\"Peucetia\\". Namensgebend für die Spinne ist ihre hellgrüne Grundfärbung. Prosoma (Vorderkörper) und Opisthosoma weisen eine Farbmusterung in Form von zwei dorsal (am Rücken) verlaufenden Längsreihen roter Punkte auf. Wie bei anderen Arten der Gattung kann auch bei dieser der gesamte Körper mit roten Punkten bedeckt sein. Jungtiere sind anfangs hellorange gefärbt.', 'Der Carapax (Rückenschild des Prosomas) der Grünen Luchsspinne weist ein hell durchscheinend grünes Erscheinungsbild auf. Die höchste Erhebung dieses Körperteils sind – wie bei Luchsspinnen üblich – die acht hexagonal angelegten Augen. Dort ist er nach oben spitz zulaufend und breitet sich nach hinten weiter aus. Die Augenregion hat schwarze Bänderungen, die sich median (mittig) im Bereich des für Luchsspinnen typischen Augenhexagons hin erstrecken. Die Augenpartie ist mit weißen und dicht anliegenden Setae (chitinisierten Haaren) bedeckt. Die Augen selber erscheinen vermutlich bei vielen Exemplaren der Art rot. Mit anderen Luchsspinnen teilt die Grüne Luchsspinne die gute Sehfähigkeit, die in etwa mit der von Wolf- (Lycosidae) oder Raubspinnen (Pisauridae) vergleichbar ist. Die Gesichtsregion und das gesamte Prosoma der Spinne sind in einem hellen, durchscheinenden Grün gehalten. Mit Ausnahme der Augenregion sind dort außerdem keinerlei Setae vorhanden. Oft verlaufen von den anterior (vorne) medianen Augen bis zum unteren und ebenfalls häufig cremefarbenen Rand des Clypeus (Abschnitt zwischen den anterioren Augen und dem Carapax) dann blassere genauso cremefarbene Streifen.', 'Die Cheliceren (Kieferklauen) sind marginal (randseitig) für gewöhnlich etwas heller gefärbt, während bei ihnen jeweils die Condyle (Ausstülpung an der Basis einer Chelicere) schwarz gefärbt ist. Innerhalb der Populationen im Osten der Vereinigten Staaten verfügen die Individuen über jeweils ein Borstenpaar, das ein Drittel des Abstands vom unteren Rand des Clypeus zu den anterior medianen Augen beträgt. Diese haben jeweils einen deutlichen schwarzen Fleck an der Basis. Ein ähnliches Borstenpaar mit schwarzen Flecken tritt innerhalb dieser Bestände in einem Drittel der Entfernung von der Basis zu den distalen (von der Körpermitte entfernt liegenden) Enden der Cheliceren auf. Bei den Populationen im Westen des Landes sind die Borsten ebenfalls vorhanden, jedoch nicht die schwarzen Flecken an der Basis der Cheliceren.', 'Das Labium (sklerotisierte, bzw. verhärtete Platte zwischen den Maxillae und vor dem Sternum), die Maxillae (umgewandelte Coxen, bzw. Hüftglieder der Pedipalpen) und das Sternum (Brustschild des Prosomas) besitzen eine grüne Färbung.', 'Die Beinformel lautet bei der Grünen Luchsspinne 1-2-4-3. Die langen und dünnen Beine der Grünen Luchspinne sind von gelber bis blassgrüner Grundfärbung und mit mehreren langen sowie schwarzen Borsten und ebenso schwarzen Punkten besonders im Bereich der Femora (Schenkel) versehen. Dort sind die großen Flecken auch zahlreicher vorhanden. Die Femora sind blassgrün gefärbt, wobei die distaleren Segmente heller grünlich-gelb erscheinen. Bei den Populationen der Art aus dem Osten der Vereinigten Staaten sowie aus Kalifornien befinden sich schwarze Flecken im Basisbereich der Stacheln an den Tibien (Schienen). Bei den Beständen der Spinne in den übrigen Teilen im Südwesten des Landes fehlen normalerweise diese schwarzen Flecken. Die Beine sind bei Arten der Gattung \\"Peucetia\\" mitsamt der Grünen Luchsspinne nicht selten hellrot gebändert.', 'Das posterior (hinten) spitz zulaufende Opisthosoma der Grünen Luchsspinne erscheint im Vergleich zum Rest des Körpers etwas heller. Dorsal ist es bei der Spinne hellgrün gefärbt, die Flecken erscheinen dann kontrastierend und kreideweiß. Meistens ist auf dem Opisthosoma dorsal eine durchscheinende, grüne, kreuzförmige und manchmal weiß umrandete Zeichnung über der Herzregion vorhanden. Auch befindet sich hier oft eine doppelte Reihung von jeweils vier weißen Winkelflecken, die bei der Herzregion ansetzt und sich in posteriorer Lage fortsetzt. Diese Winkelflecken können als weiße Flecken in Erscheinung treten oder auch balkenförmig ausgebildet sein und sind gelegentlich auf nur zwei Paare in der Nähe der Herzregion reduziert. Vor allem bei Exemplaren aus dem Südwesten der Vereinigten Staaten ist der mediane Grünanteil auf der Dorsalfläche des Opisthosomas nicht selten mit einer weißen Umrandung versehen. Dieser Bereich kann aber auch, unabhängig von der geographischen Lage, blassgrün umrandet sein. Lateral (seitlich) weist das Opisthosoma eine blassgrüne Grundfärbung sowie ebenfalls insbesondere bei den Beständen im Südwesten der Vereinigten Staaten einen weißen Längsstreifen entlang des ventralen (am Bauch liegenden) Eckpunkts des Opisthosomas auf. Auf der Ventralseite dieses Körperabschnitts verläuft median ein grüner Längsstreifen, der zusätzlich mit vielen weißen Pigmenten versehen ist und von ebenso weißen Streifen umrahmt sein kann. Genauso können die weißen Pigmente auch selber zu dann kreideweißen Streifen verwachsen sein, die dann jeweils auf beiden Seiten den grünen Längsstreifen flankieren. In seitliche Richtung geht die Farbgebung der Ventralfläche von dem Opisthosoma entlang des ventralen weißen Längsstreifens in ein Blassgrün über.', 'Sexualdimorphismus.', 'Die Grüne Luchsspinne weist wie viele Spinnen einen ausgeprägten Sexualdimorphismus auf, der hier im Vergleich zu anderen Spinnen jedoch deutlich schwächer ausgebildet ist. Dieser Dimorphismus macht sich neben der jeweiligen Farbgebung besonders in Dimension und der Form von Männchen und Weibchen bemerkbar. So ist der Körper beim Männchen deutlich schmaler.', 'Sowohl Prosoma als auch Opisthosoma des Männchens der Grünen Luchsspinne erscheinen ähnlich wie beim Weibchen in einem transparenten Grün, das hier jedoch deutlicher erscheint. Wie beim Weibchen sind ebenfalls beim Männchen schwarze Bänder im Bereich der Augen vorhanden, die sich bis zur Mitte des Augenhexagons erstrecken. Auch ist beim männlichen Tier die Augenpartie mit dicht anliegenden weißen Setae bedeckt.', 'Die Beine, das Labium, die Maxillae und Sternum hingegen erscheinen bei beiden Geschlechtern gleich. Die Beine sind allerdings je nach Geschlecht unterschiedlich lang. So erreicht das erste Beinpaar beim Weibchen eine gesamte Länge von 22,9 bis 38,7 und durchschnittlich 30,96 ± 65 Millimetern. Beim Männchen kann dieses Beinpaar eine Länge von 27,1 bis 42,9 und im Durchschnitt 33,67 ± 67 Millimetern erreichen.', 'Genitalmorphologische Merkmale.', 'Bei den Pedipalpen (: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"Luchsspinnen, Grüne Luchsspinne, Beutefang, Abwehrbiss, Brutpflege, Biss, Nützling, Merkmale, Sexualdimorphismus, genitalmorphologische Merkmale"},{"prompt":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: [['Historisches Kommunikationsgerät', 'Raumklang', 'Telefon', 'Theatergeschichte'], 'Das Theatrophon (franz.: \\"\\") war ein von Clément Ader entwickeltes System zur stereofonen Übertragung von Opern- und Theateraufführungen über ein Telefon bzw. die Leitungen eines Fernsprechnetzes. ', 'Es wurde 1881 in Paris erstmals vorgestellt. Kommerziell betrieben wurde das Theatrophon in Paris von 1890 bis 1932, wobei das Angebot um die Übertragung von Gottesdiensten und das Verlesen aktueller Nachrichten erweitert wurde. Somit stellt das \\"Theatrophon\\" sowohl inhaltlich als auch technisch einen direkten Vorläufer des Hörfunks dar. Andere Anbieter übernahmen Technik und Vermarktungsmodell des Theatrophons. So wurde das System in Großbritannien ab 1895 unter dem Namen \\"Electrophone\\" vertrieben und war dort vor allem in den 1910er Jahren sehr erfolgreich. Es gilt als frühestes Beispiel der um die Jahrhundertwende populären Telefonzeitungen.', 'Entwicklung des Theatrophons.', 'Theater und Medientechnologie waren im 19. Jahrhundert eng verbunden. Zur Live-Berichterstattung über die Weltpremiere von Giacomo Meyerbeers Oper \\"L’Africaine\\" an der Pariser Oper wurde 1865 erstmals die Telegrafie eingesetzt: „Während der Aufführung gingen stündlich telegraphische Berichte über die Aufnahme des Werks in die europäischen Hauptstädte.“ Im Jahr 1878 wurde im schweizerischen Bellinzona eine Aufführung der Oper \\"Don Pasquale\\" über ein Telefon in einen zur Oper benachbarten Saal übertragen. Diese Art der Übertragung eignete sich nicht für längere Distanzen oder ein größeres Publikum.', 'Technische Ausführung.', 'Der entscheidende Schritt zur Nutzung des Telefons als Übertragungsmedium für öffentliche Vorführungen gelang dem französischen Erfinder Clément Ader. Ader ist heute vor allem für seine Pionierarbeiten in der Luftfahrt bekannt, er hatte aber schon früh ein Interesse an der Technik des Telefons. Er verbesserte mit dem Aderschen Fernsprecher das 1876 von Alexander Graham Bell vorgestellte Telefon, entwickelte ein besseres Kohlemikrofon und installierte 1880 die erste Telefonlinie in Paris.', 'Zur Ersten Internationalen Elektrizitätsausstellung im Jahr 1881 entwickelte Ader ein neues telefonisches System für die Übertragung von Konzerten oder Theateraufführungen über längere Distanzen. Als Kopfhörer setzte er den selbstentwickelten Fernsprecher mit Hufeisenmagnet und Induktionsspule ein, der die Empfindlichkeit und Verständlichkeit wesentlich erhöhte. Als Mikrofon war das Gerät ungeeignet, weil sich die durch Bewegung der Membran induzierte elektrische Spannung noch nicht verstärken ließ. Daher griff Ader auf das Kohlemikrofon zurück, das durch Änderung seines Widerstands eine angelegte Batteriespannung variiert. Seine Weiterentwicklung dieses Geräts war stets noch ein \\"Kohlestabmikrofon\\" wie der Hughes Fernsprecher, aber ausgerüstet mit mehreren Stäben. ', 'Ader hatte 40 Mikrofone am Bühnenrand der Opéra Garnier installiert, die das Geschehen zum zwei Kilometer entfernt gelegenen Industriepalast \\"(Palais de l'Industrie)\\" an der Avenue des Champs-Élysées übertrugen, wo es in speziellen mit Hörmuscheln ausgestatteten Räumen gehört werden konnte. Zur Stromversorgung der Mikrofone setzte man zwei umschaltbare Leclanché-Elemente ein, von denen die eine Batterie jeweils nach 15 Minuten ersetzt wurde. Transformatoren sorgten für eine galvanische Trennung dieser Gleichstromkreise von den Telefonleitungen und eine Anpassung an deren Impedanz. Analog übertrug man mit 10 Mikrofonen Aufführungen der Comédie-Française. Jedes Mikrofon wurde mit acht Hörern in Reihenschaltung verbunden.', 'Für jeden Zuhörer standen zwei Hörmuscheln zur Verfügung, die mit zwei verschiedenen Mikrofonen verbunden waren. Weil das eine Mikrofon an der linken Bühnenhälfte und das andere an der rechten Bühnenhälfte stand, gelang eine Richtungslokalisation des Gehörten. Aders Demonstration war somit das erste Beispiel für eine binaurale Tonaufnahme. Technisch war die Installation der Mikrofone sehr anspruchsvoll. Die Aderschen Mikrofone drohten bei jedem lauten Auftreten auf der Bühne zu vibrieren, weshalb sie in Blei eingefasst waren und auf Gummibändern gelagert wurden. Bei der Platzierung der Orchester musste darauf geachtet werden, dass die Schlaginstrumente und Blechbläser nicht zu dicht bei den Mikrofonen standen. Die stets noch als Rampenlicht verwendeten Gasflammen störten die Mikrofone durch ihren Luftzug und die Schallbrechung aufgrund ihrer Hitze erheblich.', 'Präsentation.', 'Das später \\"Théâtrophone\\" genannte System weihte am 9. August 1881 der französische Staatspräsident Jules Grévy ein. Es entwickelte sich während der Ausstellung schnell zu einem Publikumsrenner. Von August bis November 1881 wurde das Theatrophon an drei Abenden in der Woche der Öffentlichkeit präsentiert. Zeitgenössische Berichterstatter zeigten sich begeistert von der neuen Technik. Es galt als eine Sensation, dass man über das Theatrophon nicht nur das Orchester und die Schauspieler, sondern sogar die Reaktionen des Publikums und die Stimme des Souffleurs hören konnte. Zu den Benutzern der neuen Erfindung zählte der Schriftsteller Victor Hugo, der sich in einem Tagebucheintrag vom 11. November 1881 „verzückt“ von der Präsentation zeigte. Auch der Science-Fiction-Autor Albert Robida dürfte die Erfindung ausprobiert haben; so beschrieb er 1883 in seinem utopischen Roman \\"Le Vingtième Siècle\\" \\"(Das Zwanzigste Jahrhundert)\\" ein dem Theatrophon ähnelndes Bildübertragungssystem namens „téléphonoscope“.', 'Trotz der hohen Kosten für die Installation und den Betrieb der Anlage, die sich während der Präsentation in Paris auf 160.000 Franc summierten, wurde Aders Erfindung ein Jahr später auf der Internationalen Elektrizitätsausstellung in München installiert, um sie dem bayerischen König Ludwig II. vorzustellen. Auch die Internationale Elektrische Ausstellung 1883 in Wien präsentierte die Übertragung von Klängen aus der Wiener Staatsoper. Im Mai 1883 wurde eine Demonstrationsanlage im Pariser Musée Grévin eingerichtet, mit der sich Aufführungen des Varietés \\"Eldorado\\" verfolgen ließen. Darüber hinaus blieb die Nutzung des Theatrophons nur einem ausgewählten Personenkreis vorbehalten. Präsident Grévy ließ Leitungen von der Opéra, der Comédie-Française und dem Théâtre de l'Odéon zum Élysée-Palast legen. 1884 wurden Theatrophone versuchsweise in einem Münchner Theater sowie bei den Berliner Philharmonikern eingerichtet. Im selben Jahr installierte das Ministerium für Eisenbahn, Post und Telegrafie in Brüssel ein Theatrophon; dem belgischen Königspaar präsentierte man die neue Erfindung mit Übertragungen von Aufführungen der Rossini-Opern \\"Wilhelm Tell\\" und \\"Der Barbier von Sevilla\\" zu ihrer Sommerresidenz.', 'Ebenfalls 1884 wurde im Teatro Nacional de São Carlos in Lissabon ein Theatrophon installiert, damit König Ludwig eine Opernpremiere, bei der er nicht persönlich anwesend sein konnte, zumindest von seinem Palast aus hören konnte. Ein Jahr später bot das Teatro das Theatrophon erstmals auch Privatkunden an. In einem Abonnement wurden bis zu 90 Aufführungen übertragen.', 'Erste kommerzielle Nutzung.', 'Paris.', 'Nach dem erfolgreichen Betrieb der Demonstrationsanlage im Musée Grévin wurde das Theatrophon erneut einer breiteren Öffentlichkeit während einer internationalen Ausstellung präsentiert, diesmal bei der Pariser Weltausstellung von 1889. In deren Rahmen wurde das Theatrophon Thomas Alva Edison während eines Festbanketts vorgeführt, der selbst seinen verbesserten Phonographen auf der Weltausstellung vorgestellt hatte. Edison soll „entzückt“ über die neue Erfindung gewesen sein und empfohlen haben, sie sofort in New York einzuführen.', 'Zur weiteren Vermarktung des Theatrophons wurde 1890 die \\"Compagnie du Théâtrophone\\" gegründet. Die Unternehmer Marinovitch und Szarvady entwickelten münzbetriebene Empfangsgeräte, mit denen das Theatrophon kommerziell betrieben wurde. Bei Einwurf von 50 Centimes konnte das laufende Programm für 5 Minuten gehört werden, für 1 Franc war man 10 Minuten lang verbunden. Die ersten dieser Empfänger wurden am 26. Mai 1890 im Foyer des Pariser Théâtre des Nouveautés in Betrieb genommen. Weitere Geräte wurden in Hotels, Cafés und an anderen öffentlichen Plätzen installiert. Angeboten wurden Übertragungen aus mehreren Theatern und Opernhäusern, tagsüber konnte man die Darbietung eines elektrischen Klaviers hören. Zwischen den Veranstaltungen wurden für 5 Minuten aktuelle Nachrichten verlesen, weshalb das Theatrophon als frühestes Beispiel der um die Jahrhundertwende populären Telefonzeitungen betrachtet wird.', 'Die münzbetriebenen Theatrophone entsprachen technisch einem normalen Telefon, allerdings erfolgte die Verbindung über drei Leitungen. Zwei davon wurden für den stereofonen Empfang der Darbietungen genutzt, eine dritte diente zur Kommunikation zwischen dem Benutzer und dem Veranstalter. Durch die Bedienung eines Schalters konnte der Kunde die gewünschte Spielstätte auswählen, der Anfang der Aufführung wurde dann durch eine Signallampe angezeigt. Die Geräte waren tragbar, die Verbindung mit dem Leitungsnetz der \\"Compagnie du Théâtrophone\\" erfolgte durch den Anschluss an speziellen Steckdosen.', 'Um regelmäßige Hörer zu gewinnen, wurden in vergünstigten Abonnements Jetons für die münzbetriebenen Theatrophone angeboten. Zusätzlich konnten auch Privathaushalte das Theatrophon nutzen; die jährlichen Gebühren von 180 Franc sowie die Nutzungsgebühren von 15 Franc pro Vorstellung waren so hoch, dass sich nur gehobene Bürgerschichten diese Investition erlauben konnten. Trotzdem konnte die \\"Compagnie du Théâtrophone\\" bis zum Jahr 1893 mehr als 1300 Abonnenten gewinnen. Bei den Anschlüssen in den Privathaushalten erfolgte die Verbindung zum gewünschten Veranstaltungsort durch Telefonistinnen in der zentralen Vermittlungsstelle der \\"Compagnie du Théâtrophone\\", die in der Rue Louis-le-Grand eingerichtet wurde. Weil die Leistung vorerst nur durch Vermehrung der Mikrofone (und Batterien) gesteigert werden konnte, war die Anzahl der möglichen Zuhörer einer Aufführung durch die Anzahl der auf der Bühne installierten Mikrofone limitiert.', 'Außerhalb Frankreichs.', 'Schon 1887 wurde eine Pariser Opernaufführung nach Brüssel übertragen. In Belgien entwickelte sich ein dichtes Netz von Theatrophonen, so wurden über die Telefonleitungen Aufführungen von Brüssel bis nach Ostende übertragen.

Dreißig Jahre lang stand sie ihrer Stiftsgründung selbst als Leiterin vor, ohne Äbtissin geworden zu sein. Otto I. besuchte Quedlinburg in unregelmäßigen Abständen zur Feier des Osterfestes und zu den Gedenktagen seines Vaters. Im Jahr 941 entging er dabei nur knapp einem Mordanschlag durch seinen jüngeren Bruder Heinrich. Auf dem Oster-Hoftag 966 wurde Ottos Tochter Mathilde als Äbtissin mit der Leitung des Damenstiftes betraut. Zwei Jahre später, am 14.

April 1994 in Leverkusen; eigentlich \\"Angelus Gottfried Thomas Mann\\"; heimatberechtigt in Kilchberg) war ein deutsch-schweizerischer Historiker, Publizist und Schriftsteller.', 'Der Sohn des Literaturnobelpreisträgers Thomas Mann emigrierte nach der Machtergreifung der Nationalsozialisten über Frankreich und die Schweiz in die USA. Mitte der 1950er Jahre kehrte er nach Deutschland zurück und übersiedelte später in die Schweiz. Nach einer Tätigkeit als Professor für Politikwissenschaft in Stuttgart arbeitete er als freier Publizist und einflussreicher Kommentator des Zeitgeschehens. Er verkehrte mit Politikern wie Konrad Adenauer und Willy Brandt, für den er sich zunächst als Berater einsetzte und dessen Ostpolitik er unterstützte. Ablehnend äußerte er sich zur Studentenbewegung. Vor der Bundestagswahl 1980 engagierte er sich für Franz Josef Strauß, den Kanzlerkandidaten der CDU/CSU.', 'Zu Golo Manns bekanntesten Schriften gehören die 1958 erschienene \\"Deutsche Geschichte des 19. und 20. Jahrhunderts\\", die in Millionenauflage erschien, in neun Sprachen übersetzt wurde und als Standardwerk gilt, sowie seine 1971 veröffentlichte Wallenstein-Biographie. Als konservativer Historiker stellte er den Menschen in den Mittelpunkt seiner erzählenden Geschichtswerke und zog damit die Kritik mancher Berufskollegen auf sich, die gesellschaftspolitische Theorien bevorzugten.', 'Leben.', 'Kindheit und Ausbildung.', 'Mann, der als Kleinkind seinen verkürzten Vornamen „Gelus“ nicht aussprechen konnte und sich Golo nannte, kam als drittes Kind des Schriftstellers Thomas Mann und seiner Frau Katia in München zur Welt. Dieser Kindername begleitete ihn sein Leben lang. Er hatte zwei ältere Geschwister, Erika und Klaus, und drei jüngere, Monika, Elisabeth und Michael.', 'Die Mutter beschrieb Golo in ihrem Tagebuch als sensibel, nervös und schreckhaft. Der Vater verhehlte seine Enttäuschung kaum und erwähnte den Sohn in seinem Tagebuch nur selten. Golo Mann beschrieb ihn rückblickend: „Wohl konnte er noch Güte ausstrahlen, überwiegend aber Schweigen, Strenge, Nervosität oder Zorn.“ Unter den Geschwistern fühlte er sich seinem Bruder Klaus besonders nah verbunden, während er zeitlebens Schwierigkeiten mit den radikalen Ansichten seiner Schwester Erika hatte. Klaus Mann beschrieb den Bruder als Kind in seiner ersten Autobiografie \\"Kind dieser Zeit\\" wie folgt: „Golo [aber] repräsentierte unter uns das groteske Element. Von skurriler Ernsthaftigkeit, konnte er sowohl tückisch als auch unterwürfig sein. Er war diensteifrig und heimlich aggressiv; dabei würdevoll wie ein Gnomenkönig. Ich vertrug mich ausgezeichnet mit ihm, während er sich mit Erika viel zankte.“', 'Golo Mann besuchte ab September 1918 das humanistische Wilhelmsgymnasium in München mit mittelmäßigen Leistungen, wobei seine Stärken in Geschichte, Latein und insbesondere in der Rezitation von Gedichten lagen, letzteres eine lebenslange Leidenschaft. Er war Mitglied des von den Geschwistern Klaus und Erika sowie Ricki Hallgarten im Jahr 1919 gegründeten „Laienbunds Deutscher Mimiker“. Weitere Mitspieler waren neben Monika Mann befreundete Nachbarskinder. Die Gruppe existierte drei Jahre lang und inszenierte acht Vorstellungen in Privatwohnungen.', 'Eine Abwechslung zu Elternhaus und Schule bot ihm in einer Art „Ausbruchsversuch“ im Frühjahr 1921 der Eintritt in eine Pfadfinder-Vereinigung, mit der er mehrtägige Übungen und ausgedehnte Fahrten in den Sommerferien nach Franken und Tirol unternahm. Die Gemeinschaft mit Gleichaltrigen machte ihm Spaß, jedoch gab es irritierende Erfahrungen: So wies er eine homoerotische Annäherung ab und litt unter der als Zwang empfundenen paramilitärischen Disziplin.', 'Neue Horizonte taten sich 1923 auf, als Golo Mann an die Internatsschule Schloss Salem wechselte, die er als Befreiung und lebenslange Bereicherung ansah. Der Leiter der Schule, Kurt Hahn, wurde eine prägende Persönlichkeit in seiner Jugend. In Salem sollte eine geistige Elite ausgebildet werden, die nicht nur individuelle Begabungen förderte, sondern auch das verantwortungsvolle Handeln für die Gemeinschaft. Daher gab es einen freien Umgang mit den Lehrern und einen hohen Grad von Selbstverwaltung in der Schülergemeinschaft. Der Dienst für die demokratische Gesellschaft sollte die Richtung seines zukünftigen Handelns bestimmen. ', 'Im fachlichen Bereich intensivierte Mann die Beschäftigung mit der von Hahn unterrichteten lateinischen Sprache, was ihn im Alter dazu befähigte, über Tacitus zu schreiben und Horaz zu übersetzen. In der Bodenseelandschaft bildete sich zudem eine ebenso dauerhafte Leidenschaft für Bergwanderungen aus, obgleich ihn eine beim Hochsprung erlittene Knieverletzung für den Rest seines Lebens plagen sollte. Im Rückblick, in seiner Biografie \\"Erinnerungen und Gedanken\\", kam jedoch neben der Schilderung von Hahns faszinierender Persönlichkeit dessen moralische Rigidität zur Sprache, die die Sexualität völlig ausklammerte. Der Grund sei Hahns homoerotische Neigung gewesen, die dieser [aber] missbilligt und unterdrückt habe. Golo Mann selbst hatte in Salem seine eigene homoerotische Prägung entdeckt.', 'Anfang 1925 litt Golo Mann unter einer schweren Depression, die ihn episodisch lebenslang begleitete: „Damals trat der Zweifel ein oder richtiger, brach mit unerhörter Gewalt ein […] Ich wurde von der schwärzesten Melancholie ergriffen.“', 'Im März 1927 bestand er als „Externer“ wie seine Salemer Mitschüler das Abitur an einem Gymnasium in Konstanz mit der Gesamtwertung „ziemlich gut“. Die Leistungen in Deutsch und Geschichte waren mit „sehr gut“ benotet. Im April 1927 spielte Golo Mann bei einer Theateraufführung in Salem die Rolle des Wallenstein in Schillers \\"Wallensteins Tod\\" – einer Thematik, die ihn fortan immer wieder beschäftigen sollte.', 'Studium und Beruf.', 'Nach der Reifeprüfung begann Golo Mann im Sommersemester 1927 offenbar lustlos ein Jura-Studium in München, das er in seinen \\"Erinnerungen\\" nur knapp erwähnt. Die Hochschule erschien ihm als „kalte, anonyme Maschinerie“, unter den anderen Studenten fühlte er sich fremd. Im selben Jahr setzte er seine Studien in Berlin in den Fächern Geschichte und Philosophie fort. Dort lebten sein Onkel Heinrich Mann, Thomas Manns Verleger Samuel Fischer sowie der Familienfreund Bruno Walter. Den hektischen Kulturbetrieb und die Vergnügungsstätten der Großstadt mied er. Er begegnete der Dichterin und Historikerin Ricarda Huch, die sein späteres Werk beeinflussen sollte. Den Sommer 1928 nutzte er zu einem Sprachaufenthalt in Paris und sechs Wochen „echter“ Arbeit im Braunkohlebergwerk von Schipkau in der Niederlausitz, die aufgrund neuer Kniebeschwerden ein abruptes Ende fand.', 'Golo Mann wechselte im Frühjahr 1929 an die Universität Heidelberg. Dort folgte er dem Rat seines akademischen Lehrers Karl Jaspers, in Philosophie zu promovieren und parallel Geschichte und Latein auf Lehramt zu studieren. Ab Herbst 1930 engagierte er sich zudem politisch in der sozialistischen Studentengruppe. Im April 1932 reichte Mann seine Dissertation mit dem Titel \\"Das Einzelne und das Ich in Hegels Philosophie\\" ein. Sie wurde von Jaspers mit dem Prädikat \\"cum laude\\" bewertet. Über diese Bewertung war er sehr enttäuscht. Erhalten ist Golo Manns Dissertation nur in der stark überarbeiteten und gekürzten Version, die 1935 unter dem Titel \\"Zum Begriff des Einzelnen, des Ich und des Individuellen bei Hegel\\" im Druck erschien.', 'Im Januar 1933 kam Adolf Hitler an die Macht. Für Thomas Mann, der keinen Hehl aus seiner Abneigung gegen den Nationalsozialismus gemacht hatte, und insbesondere für Golo Manns ältere Geschwister Klaus und Erika Mann war dies der Zeitpunkt zur Emigration. Während die Eltern sich auf einer Vortragsreise im Ausland aufhielten, von der sie nicht zurückkehrten, kümmerte sich Golo Mann im April 1933 um das Münchner Haus, organisierte die Ausreise der drei jüngeren Geschwister und brachte das Bankguthaben der Eltern in Sicherheit. Thomas Mann bat seinen Sohn, Bündel an Notizen und Wachstuchheften – sie enthielten die Tagebücher der Zwanziger Jahre – in einem Handkoffer zu verstauen und mittels Bahnspedition nach Lugano (CH) zu senden mit der dringenden Bitte: „Ich rechne mit Deiner Diskretion, daß du nichts von den Dingen lesen wirst.“ Hans Holzner, der Chauffeur der Familie und heimlicher Gefolgsmann Hitlers, erbot sich, den Koffer aufzugeben. Stattdessen übergab er das Gepäckstück der Bayerischen Politischen Polizei. Als es drei Wochen später immer noch nicht angekommen war, lag die Beschlagnahme nahe, und Thomas Mann beschwor den Rechtsanwalt Valentin Heins, alles zu versuchen, um die Sendung auszulösen.', 'Golo Mann beschreibt die Panik, in die sein Vater geriet: „Sie werden daraus im \\"Völkischen Beobachter\\" veröffentlichen. Sie ruinieren alles, sie werden mich auch ruinieren. Mein Leben kann nicht mehr in Ordnung kommen.“', 'Heins erreichte in Verhandlungen einige Wochen später die Herausgabe.', 'Die Arbeit für das Staatsexamen in Geschichte mit einem Wallenstein-Thema war bereits eingereicht; zur Prüfung kam es nicht mehr. Golo Mann verließ am 31. Mai 1933 Deutschland in Richtung Bandol, wo sich seine Eltern kurzzeitig aufhielten. Für die Sommermonate kam er nach einem Aufenthalt in einer Pension als Untermieter in der Villa des US-Schriftstellers William Seabrook bei Sanary-sur-Mer unter, weitere sechs Wochen lebte er in der neuen elterlichen Wohnung in Küsnacht am Zürichsee. Schließlich kehrte er nach Frankreich zurück. ', 'Ab November begannen für ihn zwei „intensive, lehrreiche Jahre“ als Lektor für deutsche Sprache an der École normale supérieure in Saint-Cloud bei Paris. Gleichzeitig arbeitete er an der Exilzeitschrift \\"Die Sammlung\\" seines Bruders Klaus mit.', 'Im November 1935 übernahm Golo Mann ein halbjähriges Lektorat für deutsche Sprache und Literatur an der Universität Rennes. Häufige Aufenthalte in der Schweiz sind ein Indiz dafür, dass sich das schwierige Verhältnis zum Vater entspannt hatte, der den politischen Sachverstand des Sohnes zunehmend zu schätzen gelernt hatte. Dass der Sohn in den Augen des Vaters an Wertschätzung gewonnen hatte, wurde ihm aber erst in vollem Umfang bewusst, als er im Alter an der Herausgabe von dessen Tagebüchern mitwirkte und s: Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück","completion":"1.
