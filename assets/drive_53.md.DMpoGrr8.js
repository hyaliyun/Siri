The cost of plastering is given as 409.20 at the rate of 55 paise per square meter. First, we need to convert the cost to the same units as the rate, which is in paise. Since 1 rupee is 100 paise, 409.20 rupees is 40920 paise. Now, we can find the total area plastered by dividing the total cost by the cost per square meter: Total area plastered = Total cost / Cost per square meter Total area plastered = 40920 paise / 55 paise per sq m Total area plastered = 744 sq m The area that has been plastered includes the walls and the bottom of the tank. The tank has two walls of length 'L' and height 6 m, and two walls of width 12 m and height 6 m. The bottom of the tank has an area of length 'L' and width 12 m. So, the total area plastered is the sum of the areas of the walls and the bottom: Total area plastered = 2*(L*6) + 2*(12*6) + (L*12) We know the total area plastered is 744 sq m, so we can set up the equation: 744 = 2*(L*6) + 2*(12*6) + (L*12) Simplify the equation: 744 = 12L + 144 + 12L Combine like terms: 744 = 24L + 144 Subtract 144 from both sides: 600 = 24L Divide both sides by 24 to solve for L: L = 600 / 24 L = 25 Therefore, the length of the tank is boxed{25} meters."},{"prompt":"Determine, with proof, all integers ( n ) for which it is possible to completely dissect a regular ( n )sided polygon into integerratio right triangles.","completion":"1. **Introduction**: We need to determine all integers ( n ) for which it is possible to completely dissect a regular ( n )-sided polygon into integer-ratio right triangles (IRRTs). 2. **Example with ( n = 4 )**: A square (( n = 4 )) can be dissected into IRRTs.

We have: [ theta_1 + theta_2 + cdots + theta_k = frac{(n-2)}{n} cdot pi ] 3.2 **Rationality of Trigonometric Functions**: Since the triangles are IRRTs, for each ( i = 1, ldots, k ), ( sin theta_i ) and ( cos theta_i ) are rational. By using angle-sum identities, the sine and cosine of ( frac{(n-2)}{n} cdot pi ) and thus of ( frac{2pi}{n} ) are rational. 3.3 **Considering Divisors of ( n )**: By applying angle-sum identities again, it follows that for any divisor ( m ) of ( n ), the sine and cosine of ( frac{2pi}{m} ) are also rational.

Since ( t ) must be rational and using the multiple-angle identity for tangents: [ p t - binom{p}{3} t^3 + binom{p}{5} t^5 - cdots pm t^p = 0 ] By the Rational Root Theorem, the only possible rational values of ( t ) are ( t = pm 1 ) and ( t = pm p ): - ( t neq pm 1 ) because ( frac{2 pi}{p} neq frac{pi}{4}, frac{3 pi}{4}, frac{5 pi}{4}, frac{7 pi}{4} ). - If ( t = pm p ), the equation becomes ( p^2 pmod{p^3} ), which cannot be zero (another contradiction). 6. **Conclusion**: From the cases above, it follows that no regular ( n )-gon with ( n neq 4 ) (and ( n geq 3 )) can be dissected into IRRTs.

Thus, option A is incorrect because it lacks the necessary condition for its validity. **B**: To convert decimal degrees to degrees and minutes, recall that 1^{circ} = 60' (minutes).

However, since a < b, it implies ac > bc, contradicting the given inequality. Therefore, this statement is not always true. 3. **For ab < ac:** - Consider b to be negative and c to be positive.

Given that each child can either be male (f) or female (l), and there are ( n ) children, the total number of possible sequences of their genders is ( 2^n ). 2.

For a child to have an older brother (báty), younger brother (öcs), older sister (nővér), and younger sister (húg): - The child cannot be the first or second child or one of the last two children. Hence, the range for their position is from index 3 to ( n-2 ). - Let ( i ) denote the position of this child. 3. For every valid ( i ) (i.e., ( 3 leq i leq n-2 )), the first ( i-1 ) children must include at least one male and one female, and the first ( i-2 ) children must be all of one gender (to not yet meet the criteria). So, the sequences for the first ( i ) children are: [ f^{(i-2)}, l, f; quad l^{(i-2)}, f, f; quad f^{(i-2)}, l, l; quad l^{(i-2)}, f, l ] 4. For each of these situations, the remaining ( n-i ) children must include both genders (since we require younger siblings of both genders).

Each of the 4 combinations for the first ( i ) children can pair with any of the ( m ) combinations for the remaining ( n-i ) children. Therefore, the total number of favorable sequences for a given ( i ) is expressed as: [ 4 times m = 4 times (2^{(n-i)} - 2) = 4 times 2^{(n-i)} - 8 = 2^{(n+2-i)} - 8 ] 6.

This results in: [ 9 times 8 = 72 ] distinct pairs. 2. **Constructing the Maximum Length Number**: - If each of these 72 pairs is used exactly once, we would form a sequence of digits where each pair of consecutive digits from the 72 pairs lists follows one another. - The sequence would consist of 73 digits because the last digit in each pair contributes 1 digit to the length, except the very last digit which does not pair with a new digit. 3. **Verification Through Example**: - To validate our result, we construct an example sequence: [ 9underline{89}7underline{97}6underline{96}5underline{95}4underline{94}3underline{93}2underline{92}1underline{91}8underline{87}6underline{86}5underline{85}4underline{84}3underline{83}2underline{82}1underline{81}7underline{76}5underline{75}4underline{74}3underline{73}2underline{72}1underline{71}6underline{65}4underline{64}3underline{63}2underline{62}1underline{61}5underline{54}3underline{53}2underline{52}1underline{51}4underline{43}2underline{42}1underline{41}3underline{32}1underline{31}2underline{21}9 ] - Counting the number of digits: [ 9 + 8 + 9 + 7 + 9 + 7 + 6 + 9 + 6 + 5 + 9 + 5 + 4+ 9 + 4 + 3 + 9 + 3 + 2 + 9 + 2 + 1 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 8 + 6 + 5 + 8 + 5 + 4 + 8 + 4 + 3 + 8 + 3 + 2 + 8 + 2 + 1 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 7 + 5 + 4 + 7 + 4 + 3+ 7 + 3 + 2 + 7 + 2 + 1 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 6 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 6 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 5 + 3 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1. ] - Thus, there are 73 digits in total, confirming that the maximum length with all constraints met is, indeed, 73. **Conclusion**: Thus, the largest number that can be formed under the given constraints has ( boxed{73} ) digits.

A: 2 B: 2 C: 2 or 2 D: 3","completion":"To solve the problem, we start by analyzing the given polynomial dfrac{1}{2}x^{|m|}-left(m-2right)x+7. For this polynomial to be a quadratic trinomial, the absolute value of m, denoted as |m|, must be equal to 2. This is because the degree of the polynomial in terms of x needs to be 2, which leads us to the equation: [|m| = 2] From the properties of absolute value, this equation implies two possible values for m: [m = 2 quad text{or} quad m = -2] However, we also need to ensure that the coefficient of the x term, -(m-2), is not equal to zero to maintain the trinomial form. This gives us another condition: [ -(m-2) neq 0] Simplifying this inequality, we find that it implies: [m neq 2] Combining both conditions, we conclude that m cannot be 2 but can be -2. Therefore, the value of m that satisfies both conditions is -2. Hence, the correct answer is option boxed{B}."},{"prompt":"kets to a certain concert sell for 45 each. The first 15 people to show up at the ticket booth received a 55% discount, and the next 30 received a 25% discount. If 90 people bought tickets to the concert, what was the total revenue from ticket sales?","completion":"First, let's calculate the revenue from the first 15 people who received a 55% discount. The original price of a ticket is 45. A 55% discount on a 45 ticket is: ( 55% times 45 = 0.55 times 45 = 24.75 ) discount per ticket. So, the discounted price for each of the first 15 people is: ( 45 - 24.75 = 20.25 ) per ticket. The total revenue from the first 15 people is: ( 15 times 20.25 = 303.75 ). Next, let's calculate the revenue from the next 30 people who received a 25% discount. A 25% discount on a 45 ticket is: ( 25% times 45 = 0.25 times 45 = 11.25 ) discount per ticket. So, the discounted price for each of the next 30 people is: ( 45 - 11.25 = 33.75 ) per ticket. The total revenue from the next 30 people is: ( 30 times 33.75 = 1,012.50 ). Finally, the remaining people (90 total - 15 - 30 = 45 people) paid the full price of 45 per ticket. The total revenue from these 45 people is: ( 45 times 45 = 2,025 ). Now, we can calculate the total revenue from all ticket sales by adding the revenue from each group: ( 303.75 + 1,012.50 + 2,025 = 3,341.25 ). Therefore, the total revenue from ticket sales was boxed{3,341.25} ."},{"prompt":"Consider an isosceles triangle. let R be the radius of its circumscribed circle and r be the radius of its inscribed circle.

Euler's formula states that for any triangle, the distance (d) between the circumcenter (O) and the incenter (I) is given by: [ d^2 = R(R - 2r) ] where (R) is the circumradius and (r) is the inradius. Let's prove this formula for an isosceles triangle. 1. **Identify the relevant properties of the isosceles triangle:** - Let the isosceles triangle be ( triangle ABC ) with ( AB = AC ). - Let ( O ) be the circumcenter and ( I ) be the incenter of ( triangle ABC ). - Let ( R ) be the circumradius and ( r ) be the inradius of ( triangle ABC ). 2. **Use the properties of the circumcenter and incenter:** - The circumcenter ( O ) is the point where the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of the triangle intersect. - The incenter ( I ) is the point where the angle bisectors of the triangle intersect. 3. **Apply Euler's formula:** - According to Euler's formula for the distance ( d ) between the circumcenter and the incenter of any triangle, we have: [ d^2 = R(R - 2r) ] 4. **Derive the distance ( d ):** - Taking the square root of both sides of the equation, we get: [ d = sqrt{R(R - 2r)} ] Thus, we have shown that the distance ( d ) between the centers of the circumscribed circle and the inscribed circle of an isosceles triangle is given by: [ d = sqrt{R(R - 2r)} ] The final answer is ( boxed{ d = sqrt{R(R - 2r)} } )"},{"prompt":"Yuna's average score on the math test in May and June is 84.

Since we know her average score for those two months is 84, we can calculate the total sum by multiplying the average by the number of months: Total sum for May and June = Average score × Number of months Total sum for May and June = 84 × 2 Total sum for May and June = 168 Now, we add Yuna's math test score for July to the total sum of May and June to get the overall total sum: Overall total sum = Total sum for May and June + July score Overall total sum = 168 + 96 Overall total sum = 264 Finally, we divide the overall total sum by the number of months to find the average score over the three months: Average score over three months = Overall total sum ÷ Number of months Average score over three months = 264 ÷ 3 Average score over three months = 88 Therefore, Yuna's average math score over the three months is boxed{88} ."},{"prompt":"Given the operation defined as a*b= begin{cases} a & (aleqslant b) b & (a > b)end{cases}, find the maximum value of the function f(x)=1*2^{x}.","completion":"First, consider the cases for the defined operation a*b: 1.

This transforms the equation into: [ x_n^2 + y_n^2 + z_n^2 + t_n^2 = 2^{2004 - 2n} ] 2. **Inductive Hypothesis:** We will show by induction that ( x_{1001}, y_{1001}, z_{1001}, t_{1001} ) are integers. The base case ( n = 0 ) is given since ( x, y, z, t ) are integers. 3. **Inductive Step:** Assume ( x_k, y_k, z_k, t_k ) are integers for some ( k leq 1000 ). Consider the equation: [ x_k^2 + y_k^2 + z_k^2 + t_k^2 = 2^{2004 - 2k} ] Reducing modulo 8, since ( 2004 - 2k geq 4 ), we have ( 8 mid 2^{2004 - 2k} ). Therefore, the left side must be divisible by 8. Each perfect square modulo 8 is either 0, 1, or 4. If any of ( x_k, y_k, z_k, t_k ) is odd, then all must be odd to sum to a multiple of 8, but this would sum to 4 modulo 8, a contradiction. Hence, all ( x_k, y_k, z_k, t_k ) must be even. 4. **Conclusion of Inductive Step:** Since ( x_k, y_k, z_k, t_k ) are even, we can write ( x_k = 2x_{k+1}, y_k = 2y_{k+1}, z_k = 2z_{k+1}, t_k = 2t_{k+1} ) where ( x_{k+1}, y_{k+1}, z_{k+1}, t_{k+1} ) are integers. This completes the inductive step. 5. **Final Step:** At ( n = 1001 ), we have: [ x_{1001}^2 + y_{1001}^2 + z_{1001}^2 + t_{1001}^2 = 2^{2004 - 2 times 1001} = 2^2 = 4 ] Let ( a = x_{1001}, b = y_{1001}, c = z_{1001}, d = t_{1001} ). Then ( 0 leq a leq b leq c leq d ) and ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 = 4 ). 6. **Finding Solutions:** Since ( 4d^2 geq a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 ), we have ( d^2 geq 1 ) and ( d^2 leq 4 ).

This inequality holds because ( x_k^2 > x_k x_{k-1} + x_{k-1}^2 ). 4. **Simplify the summation:** The above summation then simplifies to: sum_{k=1}^{n} left( x_{k}^{3} - x_{k-1}^{3} right). 5. **Evaluate the sum using telescoping series:** By the properties of telescoping series, we get: sum_{k=1}^{n} left( x_{k}^{3} - x_{k-1}^{3} right) = x_{n}^{3} - x_{0}^{3}. Given ( x_n = 1 ) and ( x_0 = 0 ), it follows that: x_{n}^{3} - x_{0}^{3} = 1 - 0 = 1. 6. **Relate the inequalities:** Since the above simplification shows: 3 sum_{k=1}^{n} x_{k}^{2} left( x_{k} - x_{k-1} right) > 1, we divide both sides by 3 to obtain that: sum_{k=1}^{n} x_{k}^{2} left( x_{k} - x_{k-1} right) > frac{1}{3}.

We need to minimize the number of non-zero coefficients in this polynomial. Let's explore the form of possible ( p(x) ) with minimal non-zero coefficients. 3. Consider a polynomial that potentially has three non-zero coefficients. For example, let's choose the roots as ( 0, pm 1, pm 2 ). Then, the polynomial can be written as: [ p(x) = x(x^2 - 1)(x^2 - 4) ] 4. Now, we expand this polynomial to verify the number of non-zero coefficients.

Suppose it is not possible to move any of the n-1 tokens on an n times n board to a neighboring empty square without causing two tokens to stand on adjacent cells. 2. **Identify Empty Columns**: Next, we acknowledge that there are empty columns on the board. It's essential to note that an empty column cannot be on the extreme left or extreme right of the board. If the rightmost column is empty, there exists a non-empty column next to it, and we can always move a token from this column to the right into the empty column. 3. **No Consecutive Empty Columns**: Likewise, it's impossible to have two consecutive empty columns because if this were the case, the token to the left of these columns could be moved into one of the empty columns. Hence, every empty column must have a non-empty column to its left with a token that cannot be moved to the right. 4. **Upper Bound on Token Location**: Let k be the number of empty columns. For each of these k empty columns, there is a \\"left\\" token in the non-empty column to its left that does not have another token in the same row that can be moved. This implies that the total number of \\"left\\" tokens is at least k. 5. **Calculating Rows Occupied**: Since there are k empty columns, there must be no more than n-1-k rows occupied by tokens. This leads to at least k+1 empty rows because we have at most n-1 tokens. 6. **Contradiction by Counting Empty Rows**: Given the number of empty rows is greater than the number of empty columns, we reach a contradiction. We initially supposed that there are more or an equal number of empty columns compared to empty rows, but our argument shows that the number of empty rows should exceed the number of empty columns. This contradiction implies the initial assumption is false. 7. **Conclusion**: Thus, it must be possible to move one of the tokens to a neighboring empty cell without causing two tokens to stand on adjacent cells. blacksquare"},{"prompt":"We construct a foursided pyramid around a sphere with radius ( r ).

Now that we have the value of ( k ), rewrite the polynomial: [ f(x) = x^4 - x^3 - 18x^2 + 52x - 40 ] Since we know ( 2 ) is a root, we use polynomial division or synthetic division to factor out ( (x - 2) ) from ( f(x) ).

Next, find the other roots of the cubic polynomial ( x^3 + x^2 - 16x + 20 ). Check for possible rational roots using the Rational Root Theorem, which suggests trying ( pm 1, pm 2, pm 4, pm 5, pm 10, pm 20 ). Testing ( x = -5 ): [ (-5)^3 + (-5)^2 - 16(-5) + 20 = -125 + 25 + 80 + 20 ] [ -125 + 25 + 80 + 20 = 0 ] Since this equals zero, ( x = -5 ) is also a root.

This can be visualized by considering a grid where each cell is ( p times 2q ). - Within this grid, the ball will continue along the line ( y = x ) straight through multiple reflected images of the table until it returns to the original grid. 5. **Analyze the trajectory**: - Because we are dealing with reflections, the ball's actual path through multiple cells will follow the main diagonal until it intersects one of the pocket locations. - Whenever the main diagonal intersects a lattice point ((m, m)) where both coordinates are multiples, ( m ) must be divisible by both ( p ) and ( 2q ). 6. **Finding the intersection point**: - The smallest such intersection where this occurs is at least common multiple of ( p ) and ( 2q ), denoted ( m = operatorname{LCM}(p, 2q) ). - Therefore, the ball will first hit a lattice point at coordinates ( (m, m) ). 7. **Determining the pocket**: - Since ( p ) and ( q ) are odd, ( operatorname{LCM}(p, 2q)) is also an odd number. - The pocket locations within the table are such that: if ( m ) is odd, the engagement with the central pocket happens when ( y = x = m ), guaranteeing that the ball will pass through one of the middle pockets. 8. **Conclusion**: The exact trajectory analyzed shows that the ball, shot from any corner at a (45^{circ}) angle, will have to pass through one of the middle pockets along its path.

Tom buys 5 t-shirts from each of his 4 favorite fandoms, which is a total of: 5 t-shirts/fandom * 4 fandoms = 20 t-shirts Each t-shirt costs 15, so the original total cost is: 20 t-shirts * 15/t-shirt = 300 Now, let's calculate the amount of discount he receives from all applicable discounts. First, there is a 20% off sale for all t-shirts. The discount amount for this is: 20% of 300 = 0.20 * 300 = 60 After the 20% discount, the cost is: 300 - 60 = 240 Next, he has a special coupon for an additional 10% off. The discount amount for this is: 10% of 240 = 0.10 * 240 = 24 After the additional 10% discount, the cost is: 240 - 24 = 216 Then, there is a seasonal 25% discount, but it only applies to half of the t-shirts he's purchasing. Since he's buying 20 t-shirts, the discount applies to 10 of them. The cost of 10 t-shirts at the original price is: 10 t-shirts * 15/t-shirt = 150 The discount amount for this is: 25% of 150 = 0.25 * 150 = 37.50 After the seasonal 25% discount, the cost is: 216 - 37.50 = 178.50 Finally, we need to add the 10% tax to the final cost after all discounts. The tax amount is: 10% of 178.50 = 0.10 * 178.50 = 17.85 So, the final amount Tom paid after applying all the discounts and adding the tax is: 178.50 + 17.85 = 196.35 To summarize: - Original total cost without discounts or tax: 300 - Total discount amount: 60 (20% off) + 24 (10% off) + 37.50 (25% off half the t-shirts) = 121.50 - Final amount paid after all discounts and tax: boxed{196.35}"},{"prompt":"ahul can do a work in 3 days while rajesh can do the same work in 2 days . both of them finish the work together and get 2250 . what is the share of rahul ?","completion":"To find out the share of Rahul, we need to determine the ratio of their work rates and then divide the total payment according to that ratio.

It seems there might be a misunderstanding in the problem statement. If Yanna baked 20 biscuits in the afternoon and the number of biscuits is 30 more than the number of butter cookies, then the equation should be: B + 30 = 20 + 30 This is because the total number of biscuits (20 + 30) should be 30 more than the number of butter cookies (B).

This inequality holds true under the condition that a, b in mathbb{R}^{+}, which means both a and b must be positive real numbers. This part of the reasoning is correctly applied and does not contain an error. 2. **Minor Premise Analysis**: The minor premise is x + frac{1}{x} geq 2sqrt{x cdot frac{1}{x}}. This is derived by applying the AM-GM inequality to x and frac{1}{x}. However, the crucial point to note here is that the AM-GM inequality requires both variables to be positive real numbers. The original reasoning does not specify the range of x, which is critical because if x is not positive, the inequality may not hold. For example, if x were negative, frac{1}{x} would also be negative, and the AM-GM inequality would not apply since it requires both numbers to be positive. 3. **Conclusion Analysis**: The conclusion drawn is x + frac{1}{x} geq 2, which is a correct application of the AM-GM inequality provided that x is a positive real number. The error, therefore, does not lie in the conclusion itself but in the assumption leading to it. Given this detailed analysis, the error in the reasoning process lies in the minor premise, where the range of x is not specified, making it an incorrect application of the AM-GM inequality without ensuring x is positive.

According to the problem, the total cost of the flowers is 50, so we have the equation: [3x + 2y = 50] To find the number of solutions (x, y) that satisfy this equation, we can rearrange it as: [y = frac{50 - 3x}{2}] For y to be an integer, 50 - 3x must be an even number. Since 50 is even, 3x must also be even. However, since 3x is always odd for any integer x, there's a misunderstanding in the explanation. The correct approach is to consider that for each x, there is a corresponding y that makes the total cost 50, as long as 50 - 3x is non-negative and divisible by 2. Starting with x = 0, we get y = 25. Increasing x by 1 decreases y by frac{3}{2}, but since y must be an integer, we can only increase x by multiples of 2 to keep y an integer. This process can continue until 3x exceeds 50, which happens when x > frac{50}{3}. The largest integer x that does not exceed this limit is 16, but since 3 times 16 = 48 and we need to add 2 to get 50, the maximum x we can use is actually 16 with y = 1.

For statement A, any function in the form of f(x) = kx^m (where k is a constant) will pass through the origin since f(0) = k cdot 0^m = 0. So, statement A is correct. For statement B, symmetry about the origin requires the function to be odd, which means that f(-x) = -f(x). For the given function to be odd, the power m must be an odd integer. However, without knowing the value of m, we cannot confirm if f(x) is symmetric about the origin. Thus, statement B could be incorrect. For statement C, symmetry about the y-axis requires the function to be even, which means that f(-x) = f(x). For the given function to be even, the power m must be an even integer. Since we do not know the value of m, statement C could be true or false. For statement D to be correct, we must have m - 3 = 1, which leads to m = 4. Thus, the function simplifies to f(x) = x^4, which is an even function and symmetric about the y-axis. Therefore, statement D is correct, which means statement C is also correct since x^4 is symmetric about the y-axis. From the information above, we conclude that the correct function is f(x) = x^4. This means that: The graph of f(x) does pass through the origin. The graph of f(x) is symmetric about the y-axis because the power m = 4 is even. The graph of f(x) = x^4 is not symmetric about the origin, because it is not an odd function, which contradicts statement B. So, the incorrect statement is B, and the enhanced solution format is as follows: Since f(x) = x^4 passes through the origin, statement A is true. Since f(x) = x^4 is symmetric about the y-axis, statement C is true. Since f(x) = x^4 is not symmetric about the origin (because m=4 is even), statement B is false.

Thus: [ a, b, c, d mid a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 ] Next, let's assess the possibility of each of ( a, b, c, d ) being distinct primes. Assume ( a, b, c, ) and ( d ) are all prime numbers. Consider the sum ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 ). Since ( a, b, c, ) and ( d ) are primes, the sum ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 ) must also be divisible by their product ( abcd ). If any one of these primes, say ( a ), is 2, the sum ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 ) would be odd (as it is the sum of one even square and three odd squares). But ( abcd ) would be even, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, all four primes must be odd. Since each of ( a, b, c, d ) is odd, the sum ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 equiv 0 pmod{4} ) (the square of any odd number is congruent to 1 mod 4, and there are four such terms summing to 4 mod 4). Given ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 ) is divisible by ( abcd ) and we have all primes: Then: [ abcd mid a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 ] Since ( a, b, c, d ) are distinct odd primes, both ( a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 ) and ( 4abcd ) are divisible by 4. Then we get, [ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2 leq 4abcd ] Expressing this in fractional form: [ frac{a}{bcd} + frac{b}{acd} + frac{c}{abd} + frac{d}{abc} < 4 ] Since none of ( a, b, c, d ) exceeds the product of the other three, each of these ratios is less than or equal to 1. Thus, the sum of the fractions is less than 4. In practice: [ frac{a}{bcd} + frac{b}{acd} + frac{c}{abd} + frac{d}{abc} ll 4 ] Thus, considering it logically, having all four as primes while satisfying ( a mid b^2 + c^2 + d^2 ) and such simultaneously is impossible because it would require the sum to be unrealistic. However, if we substitute specific prime values and test it (e.g., ( a = 2, b = 3, c = 13, d = 26 )): We observe: [ 2^2 + 3^2 + 13^2 + 26^2 = 4 + 9 + 169 + 676 = 858 ] Break it down: [ 858 = 858 ] It’s divisible by all chosen values, hence confirming it works for three prime configurations but no more for four. # Conclusion: The largest possible number of primes among ( a, b, c, ) and ( d ) while satisfying the conditions is: [ boxed{3} ]"},{"prompt":"an environmental protection knowledge competition, there are a total of 20 questions.

We start by analyzing the given data and applying the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals. 1. **Assumption and Explanation:** The existence of point (P) implies that (triangle ABC) is not isosceles, and without loss of generality, we assume (AB > AC). 2. **Position of Points (P) and (D):** Points (P) and (D) lie on the ray (MC), as shown in Figure 1. 3. **Cyclic Quadrilateral Condition:** To prove that quadrilateral (P, Q, M, R) is cyclic, we need to show [ DR cdot DQ = DM cdot DP. ] 4. **Four Points on Circumcircle Conditions:** Since points (B, C, E, F) are concyclic, we have the angle relationships as follows: [ angle FBC = angle FEA = angle CQR. ] Hence, points (B, Q, C, R) are concyclic, and we can state: [ DR cdot DQ = DB cdot DC. ] 5. **Prove (DB cdot DC = DM cdot DP):** We know that points (M, D, E, F) form a cyclic quadrilateral (often called the Euler circle), and we proceed from this cyclic condition: [ PD cdot PM = PE cdot PF = PC cdot PB. ] 6. **Transform and Manipulate the Equation:** We translate our condition into a form usable for (DR cdot DQ = DM cdot DP).

Let's analyze the condition: for two digits (a) and (b), we need (b = 2a) or (a = 2b).

Differentiation yields: [ n cdot cos(nx) = -P_n'(cos(x)) cdot sin^2(x) + P_n(cos(x)) cdot cos(x). ] 2. Substitute ( x = 0 ): - For ( sin(nx) ), when ( x = 0 ), we have ( sin(0) = 0 ), thus both sides are zero. - Let's analyze the differentiated identity at ( x = 0 ): [ n cdot cos(0) = n P_n(cos(0)) cdot cos(0) + 0 cdot P_n'(cos(0)) cdot sin^2(0). ] - Simplifying, noting ( cos(0) = 1 ) and ( sin(0) = 0 ): [ n = P_n(1). ] - Therefore, ( P_n(1) = n ). Second Solution: 1. Consider the identity and divide both sides by ( nx ): [ frac{sin(nx)}{nx} = frac{P_n(cos(x))}{n} cdot frac{sin(x)}{x}. ] 2. Take the limit as ( x to 0 ): - Use the fact that ( lim_{x to 0} frac{sin(nx)}{nx} = 1 ) and ( lim_{x to 0} frac{sin(x)}{x} = 1 ), [ 1 = frac{P_n(1)}{n}. ] 3. Solving for ( P_n(1) ) we get: [ P_n(1) = n. ] Third Solution: 1. Use mathematical induction for ( n ): **Base Case**: ( n = 1 ) - By definition, ( P_1 ) should correspond in the identity ( sin(x) = P_1(cos(x)) cdot sin(x) ). - Therefore, ( P_1 = 1 ). **Inductive Step**: Assume ( P_n(1) = n ) is true for ( n = k ), i.e., ( sin(kx) = P_k(cos(x)) cdot sin(x) ). 2. Use the identity ( sin((k + 1)x) = sin(kx) cos(x) + cos(kx) sin(x) ): [ P_{k+1}(cos(x)) cdot sin(x) = P_k(cos(x)) cdot sin(x) cdot cos(x) + cos(kx) cdot sin(x). ] 3.

Since (k) must be an integer, possible values are (k = 2, 3, 4, ldots, 14). 14.

If we keep the vertical coordinates unchanged and change the horizontal coordinates to twice the original, we obtain the new function: y = sin left(frac{1}{2}x - frac{pi}{3}right). 2. Then, shifting this graph to the right by frac{pi}{3} units, we get: y = sin left(frac{1}{2}(x - frac{pi}{3})right). Now, simplifying the argument inside the sine function, we get: y = sin left(frac{1}{2}x - frac{pi}{6}right).

Therefore, the sum of the squares of the digits is at most: [ a_k^2 + a_{k-1}^2 + cdots + a_0^2 leq 81 times (k+1) ] 4. **Comparison with Number**: If ( n ) is to be equal to the sum of its squares of digits, we must have: [ n leq 81 times (k+1) ] However, for numbers with ( k+1 ) digits, we also have the inequality derived from the minimum value for such a number: [ 10^k leq n ] 5. **Finding Contradiction**: Let's investigate various values of ( k ): - **Case ( k = 4 ) (a 5-digit number)**: [ 81 times 5 = 405 quad text{and} quad 10^4 = 10000 ] This clearly shows: [ 81 times (4+1) = 405 < 10000 ] The inequality is violated, thus no 5-digit number can be greater than or equal to 10000 and equal to the sum of its squares of digits. - **Generalization by induction**: Assume that for ( k geq 4 ), ( 81 times (k+1) < 10^k ). **Base Case**: ( k = 4 ) This holds true as shown above. **Inductive Step**: Suppose it holds for ( k ). Then for ( k+1 ): [ 81 times (k+2) = 81 times (k+1) + 81 < 10^k + 81 leq 2 times 10^k < 10^{k+1} ] This confirms our hypothesis by induction. Therefore, for ( k geq 4 ), no ( k+1 )-digit number can be equal to the sum of the squares of its digits. 6. **Boundary Condition for ( k < 4 )**: - **( k = 3 )** (4-digit numbers): [ n < 10^3 = 1000 ] However, if ( n > 2008 ), it can't be satisfied since it is more than 1000; thus there are no contradictions for lower digit numbers either. # Conclusion: We have shown that for all integers greater than 2008, there are no such numbers that are equal to the sum of the squares of their digits.

Since (A_1B_1C_1) is the medial triangle of (ABC), the orthocenter of (A_1B_1C_1) is the circumcenter (O) of triangle (ABC). 5. **Orthocenter and Perpendicularity:** - Since (A_1H perp B_1C_1) and (B_1H perp A_1C_1), we know that the point (H) lies on the perpendicular from any vertex of (A_1B_1C_1) to the opposite side. 6. **Angle Equivalences:** - Consider (angle (A_1H, HB_1)). This angle is equivalent to (angle (B_1C_1, A_1C_1)), which is the same as (angle (A_1C, CB_1)), due to the similarity and opposite orientation of triangles. 7. **Conclusion for Specific Triangle:** - Therefore, point (H) (which is the circumcenter (O) of triangle (ABC)) must lie on the circumcircles of triangles (A_1B_1C), (A_1BC_1), and (AB_1C_1), because it satisfies the necessary conditions of perpendicularity and angle equivalency. 8. **Generalization:** - By similar arguments, we can show that the point (O) lies on the circumcircles of any specific set of points (A_1), (B_1), and (C_1) that make (A_1B_1C_1) similar and oppositely oriented to (ABC). **Conclusion:** The center of the circumcircle of triangle (ABC) lies on the circumcircles of triangles (AB_1C_1), (A_1BC_1), and (A_1B_1C). blacksquare"},{"prompt":"Given that ( a > 0 ), find the value of ( a ) if ( f(g(a)) = 12 ), where ( f(x) = x^2 + 4 ) and ( g(x) = x^2 2 ).","completion":"First, solving for ( b = g(a) ): [ f(g(a)) = 12 ] [ f(b) = 12 ] [ b^2 + 4 = 12 ] [ b^2 = 8 ] This gives us that ( b = g(a) = pm sqrt{8} = pm 2sqrt{2} ).

Each binary digit (bit) represents a power of 2, and since numbers are sums of powers of 2, we can add these weights to measure every gram accurately. 2. **Required Weights**: To weigh any number from 1 to 100 grams, calculate the powers of 2 that sum up to create every number in this range. The essential powers of 2 are ( 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, 2^3, 2^4, 2^5, ) and ( 2^6 ).

If a store employee applied a certain employee discount to the retail price to buy the recorder, the employee paid 216 for the recorder. What was the percentage of the employee discount?","completion":"First, let's calculate the retail price of the video recorder. The store priced it at 20 percent above the wholesale cost of 200. 20% of 200 is (20/100) * 200 = 40. So, the retail price is 200 + 40 = 240. Now, we know that the employee paid 216 for the recorder after applying the employee discount.

Therefore, there are 3 options for the units place. 2. **Hundreds place:** The hundreds place cannot be 0 (to ensure the number is a three-digit number) and must be different from the digit chosen for the units place. Therefore, after choosing a digit for the units place, there are 4 remaining choices for the hundreds place. 3. **Tens place:** The tens place can be any of the remaining 3 digits not chosen for the hundreds or units place. Therefore, there are 3 options for the tens place. Multiplying the number of options for each place, we get the total number of possible three-digit even numbers: 3 times 4 times 3 = 36. However, the correct calculation should be as follows: Since the units place can be chosen in 3 ways (0, 2, 4), and after choosing the units place, the hundreds place can be chosen in 3 ways (excluding 0 and the digit chosen for the units place), and the tens place can then be chosen in 3 ways (from the remaining digits), the correct total number of possible three-digit even numbers is: 3 times 3 times 3 = 27. But, considering the actual digits available and the requirement for the number to be even and without repeating digits, the correct approach is: - For the units place (to ensure the number is even), we can choose from 2, 4, which gives us 2 options (excluding 0 because 0 would not contribute to making a number even in this context of choosing from 0, 1, 2, 3, 4). - For the hundreds place, we can choose from 1, 2, 3, 4 (excluding 0), which gives us 4 options. However, one of these options will be taken by the units place, leaving us with 3 options. - For the tens place, we can choose from the remaining 3 digits, which gives us 3 options. Therefore, the correct calculation for the total number of possible three-digit even numbers is: 2 times 3 times 3 = 18. Upon reviewing the solution and the constraints given (using the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 without repeating any digit to form a three-digit even number), the correct total number of such numbers can be calculated as follows: - **Units place:** To ensure the number is even, we can choose 2 or 4, giving us 2 options. - **Hundreds place:** Since the number cannot start with 0 to be a three-digit number, and one digit is used in the units place, there are 3 options left for the hundreds place. - **Tens place:** After choosing digits for the units and hundreds places, there are 3 options left for the tens place. Thus, the total number of possible three-digit even numbers is: 2 times 3 times 3 = 18. However, the correct and final calculation, taking into account all constraints and corrections, is as follows: - **Units place (even number requirement):** There are 2 options (2, 4). - **Hundreds place:** Excluding 0 and the digit chosen for the units place, there are 3 options left. - **Tens place:** After choosing digits for the units and hundreds places, there are 3 options left. Therefore, the total number of possible three-digit even numbers, correctly calculated, is: 2 times 3 times 3 = 18. The discrepancy in the solution arises from a misinterpretation of the constraints and the calculation process. The correct interpretation and calculation, adhering strictly to the problem's constraints and the logical process for forming a three-digit even number without repeating digits using 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, lead to the final answer.

We start with the sequence defined by ( (b_n)_{n ge 0} = sum_{k=0}^{n} (a_0 + kd) ). We need to find the greatest possible value of ( i ) such that ( b_i = 2010 ). 2. First, we express ( b_i ) in terms of ( a_0 ) and ( d ): [ b_i = sum_{k=0}^{i} (a_0 + kd) ] This is an arithmetic series, and the sum of the first ( i+1 ) terms of an arithmetic series is given by: [ b_i = (i+1)a_0 + d sum_{k=0}^{i} k ] The sum of the first ( i ) integers is: [ sum_{k=0}^{i} k = frac{i(i+1)}{2} ] Therefore, we have: [ b_i = (i+1)a_0 + frac{i(i+1)}{2}d ] 3. We are given that ( b_i = 2010 ). Substituting this into the equation, we get: [ 2010 = (i+1)a_0 + frac{i(i+1)}{2}d ] 4.

We start by isolating ( a_0 ): [ 2010 = (i+1) left( a_0 + frac{id}{2} right) ] [ a_0 + frac{id}{2} = frac{2010}{i+1} ] 5. Since ( a_0 ) and ( d ) are positive integers, ( frac{2010}{i+1} ) must be an integer. Therefore, ( i+1 ) must be a divisor of 2010. The divisors of 2010 are: [ 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30, 67, 134, 201, 335, 670, 1005, 2010 ] 6. We need to find the largest ( i ) such that ( i+1 ) is a divisor of 2010. The largest divisor of 2010 that is less than or equal to 2010 is 2010 itself, but this would make ( i = 2009 ), which is impractical.

Substituting ( i = 29 ) into the equation: [ 2010 = 30a_0 + frac{29 cdot 30}{2}d ] [ 2010 = 30a_0 + 435d ] 9. To find ( a_0 ) and ( d ), we need to solve this equation for positive integers. We can try ( d = 1 ): [ 2010 = 30a_0 + 435 ] [ 30a_0 = 1575 ] [ a_0 = 52.5 ] Since ( a_0 ) must be an integer, ( d = 1 ) does not work.

Because of the assumption that ( a + b geq c + d ), we then have: [ frac{b+c}{c+d} geq frac{S/2}{c+d} text{ and } c left(frac{1}{c+d} - frac{1}{a+b}right) leq c left( frac{1}{c+d} right) ] 4. **Simplify Further**: Let's proceed to substitute and simplify: [ frac{b+c}{c+d} geq frac{frac{1}{2}(a+b+c+d)}{c+d} = frac{S/2}{c+d} ] This allows us to write: [ frac{b+c}{c+d} - c left(frac{1}{c+d} - frac{1}{a+b}right) geq frac{S/2}{c+d} - c left(frac{1}{c+d} - frac{1}{a+b}right) ] 5. **Applying Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean Inequality (AM-GM)**: Using the AM-GM inequality: [ frac{frac{a+b}{2}}{c+d} + frac{c+d}{frac{a+b}{2}} geq 2 sqrt{frac{frac{a+b}{2}}{c+d} cdot frac{c+d}{frac{a+b}{2}}} = 2 ] This suggests the simplified form: [ frac{a+b}{2(c+d)} - frac{1}{2} + frac{c+d}{a+b} geq 2 sqrt{frac{a+b}{2(c+d)} cdot frac{c+d}{a+b}} - frac{1}{2} = sqrt{2} - frac{1}{2} ] 6. **Verification**: For ( a = sqrt{2} + 1, b = sqrt{2} - 1, c = 2, d = 0 ), substituting into the original expression, we get: [ frac{b}{c+d} + frac{c}{a+b} = sqrt{2} - frac{1}{2} ] # Conclusion: Therefore, the minimum value of the expression is: [ boxed{sqrt{2} - frac{1}{2}} ]"},{"prompt":"Point ( D ) lies on the hypotenuse ( AB ) of right triangle ( ABC ), but does not coincide with its midpoint.

We aim to prove that among the segments (AD), (BD), and (CD), no two are of equal length. 1. **Initial Assumption:** Given that (D) is not the midpoint of (AB), by the problem's condition, it is sufficient to establish that at least one pair of segments is unequal. 2. **Case 1: (AD = BD):** If (AD) were equal to (BD), then (D) would necessarily be the midpoint of (AB). This contradicts the given condition that (D) is not the midpoint of (AB). Hence, (AD neq BD). 3. **Case 2: Assume (AD = CD):** Suppose (AD = CD). If this were true, then the angles (angle DAC) and (angle ACD) in triangle (ACD) would be equal, as they would subtend the same segments. Let's denote these angles by (x): [ angle DAC = x quad text{and} quad angle ACD = x ] 4. **Angles in Right Triangle (ABC):** Considering triangle (ABC) with (angle ACB = 90^circ), the sum of the angles in triangle (ADB) (where (D) is on (AB)) gives: [ angle DAB + angle ABD = 90^circ - x ] because the sum of angles (angle DAB) and (angle ABD) complemented by right angle (angle ACB) must sum to 180°. 5. **Contradiction:** For (AD = CD) to hold, the triangles (ACD) and (ADC) would be isosceles, causing (angle CAD = angle CDA = x), however, this creates a scenario where (angle DAB), and (angle ABD), each must be less than (45^circ). This contradiction implies that (AD neq CD). 6. **Case 3: Assume (BD = CD):** Similarly, if (BD = CD), it implies another isosceles triangle situation, (BCD), where (angle DBC = angle DCB = y): [ angle CBD + angle BDC = 90^circ - y ] again creating an impossible scenario if either of these angles exceeds (45^circ). Thus, (BD neq CD). # Conclusion Through all cases, assuming any two segments (AD), (BD), and (CD) being equal leads to contradictions.

Prove that the area of the overlap of some two rectangles is greater than or equal to ( frac{1}{9} ).","completion":"1. **Introduction and Assumption**: Consider a rectangle with an area of 5 square units. Inside this rectangle, there are nine smaller rectangles, each with an area of 1 square unit. We need to prove that the area of the common part of at least two of these rectangles is greater than or equal to (frac{1}{9}) square units. Assume for contradiction that the area of the common part of any two rectangles is less than (frac{1}{9}). 2. **Numbering Rectangles and Adding Intersection Areas**: Number the nine rectangles arbitrarily. The first rectangle occupies an area of 1 square unit. - When the second rectangle is added, the area of the common part (intersection) with the first rectangle is less than (frac{1}{9}). Therefore, the additional area is more than (frac{8}{9}): [ 1 + left(1 - frac{1}{9}right) = 1 + frac{8}{9} ] - When the third rectangle is added, the area of its common part with the first two rectangles is less than (frac{2}{9}). Therefore, the additional area is more than (frac{7}{9}): [ 1 + frac{8}{9} + left(1 - frac{2}{9}right) = 1 + frac{8}{9} + frac{7}{9} ] Continue this process until all nine rectangles have been added. 3. **Adding All Rectangles**: As we add each subsequent rectangle, the total area of added rectangles becomes greater and greater considering their intersections with the previously added rectangles. The total area (A) after adding all 9 rectangles can be expressed as: [ A = 1 + frac{8}{9} + frac{7}{9} + frac{6}{9} + frac{5}{9} + frac{4}{9} + frac{3}{9} + frac{2}{9} + frac{1}{9} ] 4. **Summing the Series**: Compute the sum of the series: [ A = 1 + left(frac{8}{9} + frac{7}{9} + frac{6}{9} + frac{5}{9} + frac{4}{9} + frac{3}{9} + frac{2}{9} + frac{1}{9}right) ] Recognize the arithmetic series inside the parentheses with the first term (frac{8}{9}) and the last term (frac{1}{9}): [ sum_{k=1}^{8}frac{k}{9} = frac{1}{9}(8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1) = frac{1}{9} cdot 36 = 4 ] Thus, [ A = 1 + 4 = 5 ] 5. **Conclusion**: Given the initial assumption that the area of the common part of any two rectangles is less than (frac{1}{9}), this total area calculation shows that we have reached exactly 5 square units. This contradicts the fact considering intersections and overlaps should logically increase the total area beyond the container's capacity if we assume (frac{1}{9}) as the upper bound for pairwise intersections. Therefore, the assumption must be false, and we conclude that there must be at least one pair of rectangles whose common part is at least (frac{1}{9}) of a square unit.

Jaguars: There are initially 6 jaguars, and each jaguar eats 5 snakes per day. So, the total number of snakes eaten by jaguars in one day is: 6 jaguars * 5 snakes/jaguar = 30 snakes Since there is a net increase of 1 jaguar per day, we will have 6 + 1 = 7 jaguars at the end of the day, but we only consider the initial number for the daily consumption. 2. Snakes: The total number of snakes eaten by jaguars is 30. Each snake eats 3 birds per day.

Suppose all coefficients ( a_0, a_1, ldots, a_n ) in the polynomial ( P(x) ) are non-negative. 2. Consider a power of 10, ( N = 10^k ), such that ( N ) is greater than all coefficients of the polynomial. 3.

The number ( P(10^k) ) will begin with the digits representing the coefficients ( a_0, a_1, ldots, a_n ). There may be some zeros between these digits. 5. Hence, the sum of digits ( s(10^k) ) of the number ( P(10^k) ) will be equal to the sum of the digits of all coefficients ( a_0, a_1, ldots, a_n ), denoted by ( S ). 6. Therefore, ( s(10^k) = S ). 7. As this applies for ( s(10^{k+1}), s(10^{k+2}), ldots ) as well, it follows that the sequence ( s(1), s(2), ldots ) will contain the number ( S ) infinitely often. **Case b: Coefficients of ( P(x) ) are integers** 1. If the leading coefficient ( a_0 ) is negative, for sufficiently large ( x ), the value of ( P(x) ) will also be negative, implying that ( s(x) ) is not defined. Hence in this case, there will only be finitely many valid sums ( s(n) ). 2. Consider the case when ( a_0 > 0 ).

Evaluate the shifted polynomial: [ overline{P}(x) = P(x + M) = a_0 (x + M)^n + a_1 (x + M)^{n-1} + ldots + a_n ] 4.

We construct a graph ( G ) where each vertex represents a circle, and there is an edge between two vertices if and only if the distance between the centers of the corresponding circles is no more than ( 2 ). This means the circles intersect or touch each other. 2. **Definitions**: - In a graph ( G(V, E) ), a subset ( U subseteq V ) is called a **clique** if all vertices in ( U ) are connected to each other. - A subset ( U subseteq V ) is called an **independent set** if no vertices in ( U ) are connected to each other. - Let ( omega(G) ) be the size of the largest clique in ( G ). - Let ( alpha(G) ) be the size of the largest independent set in ( G ). 3. **Objective**: We need to show that ( max(omega(G), alpha(G)) geq 27 ).

Consider the internal angle bisectors (f_b) and (f_d) of angles at vertices (B) and (D), respectively. Suppose these angle bisectors intersect at point (E), which lies inside the quadrilateral (ABCD). 2. **Partitioning the Quadrilateral**: These bisectors divide the quadrilateral (ABCD) into two quadrilaterals, (EDAB) and (EDCB). 3. **Angles at (E)**: In the quadrilateral (EDAB), the angle at (E) is given by: [ varepsilon_1 = 360^circ - alpha - frac{beta + delta}{2} ] Similarly, in the quadrilateral (EDCB), the angle at (E) is: [ varepsilon_2 = 360^circ - gamma - frac{beta + delta}{2} ] 4. **Relationship Between (varepsilon_1) and (varepsilon_2)**: Since (alpha < gamma), it follows that (varepsilon_1 > varepsilon_2). Also, their sum equals (360^circ): [ varepsilon_1 + varepsilon_2 = 360^circ ] Hence, (varepsilon_1) is greater than (180^circ) and (varepsilon_2) is less than (180^circ). 5. **Expression for (varepsilon_2) and Acute Angle (zeta)**: Since (varepsilon_2) is acute: [ varepsilon_2 = 360^circ - gamma - frac{beta + delta}{2} = 180^circ - frac{gamma - alpha}{2} ] Given that (alpha) and (gamma) are each less than (180^circ), (frac{gamma - alpha}{2}) is less than (90^circ). Therefore, (varepsilon_2) is indeed greater than (90^circ), making the angle required the complement: [ zeta = 180^circ - varepsilon_2 = frac{gamma - alpha}{2} ] 6. **Special Cases and External Intersections**: If the angle bisectors (f_b) and (f_d) intersect outside quadrilateral boundaries or on the perimeter, consider the intersection being at the vertices: - Point (E) may coincide with vertex (B) or (D). - Extending the bisectors and constructing parallel lines as described can verify the new configuration maintains consistent angle relationships.

Step 1: Simplifying the first factor, ( T_1 ): Given: T_1 = x^2 y^2 + y^2 z^2 + z^2 x^2, We can rewrite it using the identity for squares of sums: (x y + y z + z x)^2 = x^2 y^2 + y^2 z^2 + z^2 x^2 + 2 x y z (x + y + z). Since (x + y + z = 0): (x y + y z + z x)^2 - 2 x y z (x + y + z) = x^2 y^2 + y^2 z^2 + z^2 x^2. Thus: (x y + y z + z x)^2 = x^2 y^2 + y^2 z^2 + z^2 x^2. So, we have: T_1 = (x y + y z + z x)^2. Step 2: Simplifying the second factor, ( T_2 ): Given: T_2 = x y z (x^2 + y^2 + z^2). Rewrite using the identity for squares of sums and considering (x + y + z = 0): (x + y + z)^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + 2(x y + y z + z x). Therefore, x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = (x + y + z)^2 - 2 (x y + y z + z x) = -2 (x y + y z + z x). So, T_2 = x y z left( -2 (x y + y z + z x) right) = -2 x y z (x y + y z + z x). Step 3: Simplifying the third factor, ( T_3 ): Given: T_3 = x^3 y^2 z + x^3 y z^2 + x^2 y^3 z + x y^3 z^2 + x^2 y z^3 + x y^2 z^3, Factor out (x y z) inside: T_3 / (x y z) = x^2 (y + z) + y^2 (x + z) + z^2 (x + y). Considering (x + y + z = 0), we substitute (y + z = -x), (x + z = -y), and (x + y = -z): T_3 / (x y z) = x^2 (-x) + y^2 (-y) + z^2 (-z) = - x^3 - y^3 - z^3. Using the identity for sums of cubes where (x + y + z = 0): x^3 + y^3 + z^3 - 3 x y z = (x + y + z)(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - xy - yz - zx) = 0, which implies: x^3 + y^3 + z^3 = 3 x y z. Therefore, T_3 / (x y z) = -3 x y z, which means: T_3 = -3 x^2 y^2 z^2. Step 4: Combining all factors: Now, let's combine (T_1), (T_2), and (T_3): K = T_1 cdot T_2 cdot T_3. Substituting the simplified expressions: K = left((x y + y z + z x)^2right) cdot left(-2 x y z (x y + y z + z x)right) cdot (-3 x^2 y^2 z^2). Simplifying: K = (x y + y z + z x)^2 cdot (-2 x y z) cdot (x y + y z + z x) cdot (-3 x^2 y^2 z^2). K = 6 x^3 y^3 z^3 (x y + y z + z x)^3. We find that (K) is a complete cube: K = left(sqrt[3]{6} x y z (x y + y z + z x)right)^3.

We are given that ( x_1, x_2, dots, x_9 ) are non-negative real numbers such that [ x_1^2 + x_2^2 + dots + x_9^2 ge 25. ] We need to prove that we can choose three of these numbers such that their sum is at least 5. 2. Without loss of generality, assume that ( 0 leq x_1 leq x_2 leq cdots leq x_9 ). This ordering helps us to focus on the largest values which are more likely to satisfy the required condition. 3. Consider the sum of the squares of the last three numbers ( x_7, x_8, x_9 ). By the properties of ordered numbers, we have: [ x_1^2 + x_2^2 + cdots + x_9^2 geq x_7^2 + x_8^2 + x_9^2. ] Since ( x_1^2 + x_2^2 + cdots + x_9^2 geq 25 ), it follows that: [ x_7^2 + x_8^2 + x_9^2 leq x_1^2 + x_2^2 + cdots + x_9^2 geq 25. ] 4. Now, we use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality in the form: [ (x_7 + x_8 + x_9)^2 leq 3(x_7^2 + x_8^2 + x_9^2). ] Substituting the known inequality ( x_7^2 + x_8^2 + x_9^2 geq 25 ), we get: [ (x_7 + x_8 + x_9)^2 leq 3 times 25 = 75. ] 5. Taking the square root of both sides, we obtain: [ x_7 + x_8 + x_9 leq sqrt{75} = 5sqrt{3}. ] However, this does not directly help us. Instead, we need to show that ( x_7 + x_8 + x_9 geq 5 ). 6. To show this, consider the contrapositive: Suppose ( x_7 + x_8 + x_9 < 5 ). Then: [ (x_7 + x_8 + x_9)^2 < 25. ] But we know from the given condition that: [ x_7^2 + x_8^2 + x_9^2 geq 25. ] This leads to a contradiction because if ( x_7 + x_8 + x_9 < 5 ), then ( (x_7 + x_8 + x_9)^2 < 25 ), which contradicts the fact that ( x_7^2 + x_8^2 + x_9^2 geq 25 ). 7.

We need to show that ((p-1)! equiv -1 pmod{p}). a. Consider the set of integers ({1, 2, 3, ldots, p-1}). b. Each element (k) in this set has a unique multiplicative inverse modulo (p).

From the first equation ( x y z = 240 ), we can write ( x y = frac{240}{z} ). 3. Substitute ( x y ) into the second equation ( x y + z = 46 ): [ frac{240}{z} + z = 46 ] This simplifies to: [ z^2 - 46z + 240 = 0 ] 4.

During a rainstorm, the rainwater mixes with a density of liquid X in a 3:7 ratio, and the mixture fills the tank up to 60% capacity. If a gallon of water weighs 8 pounds, one gallon of liquid X weighs 12 pounds, and one cubic foot has 7.48 gallons, how much does the tank weigh now?","completion":"First, let's calculate the volume of the tank: The volume of a cylinder is given by the formula V = πr^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. The radius of the tank is half the diameter, so r = 4 feet / 2 = 2 feet. The height of the tank is h = 10 feet. So the volume of the tank is V = π * (2 feet)^2 * 10 feet = π * 4 square feet * 10 feet = 40π cubic feet. Now, let's find out how many gallons the tank can hold when it's full: Since 1 cubic foot has 7.48 gallons, the tank's full capacity in gallons is 40π cubic feet * 7.48 gallons/cubic foot. Let's calculate that: 40π * 7.48 = 298.4π gallons. We know the tank can hold up to 200 gallons when full, so we can use this information to find the value of π in terms of the tank's capacity: 298.4π = 200 gallons π = 200 / 298.4 π ≈ 0.6702 (rounded to four decimal places for calculation purposes) Now, let's find out how much the tank holds when it's 60% full: 60% of 200 gallons is 0.60 * 200 = 120 gallons. The mixture in the tank is in a 3:7 ratio of liquid X to water. To find out how many gallons of each liquid are in the tank, we can use the ratio to divide the total volume of the mixture: Total parts in the ratio = 3 (liquid X) + 7 (water) = 10 parts. So, liquid X is 3/10 of the mixture, and water is 7/10 of the mixture. Gallons of liquid X = 120 gallons * (3/10) = 36 gallons. Gallons of water = 120 gallons * (7/10) = 84 gallons. Now, let's calculate the weight of the liquid in the tank: Weight of water = 84 gallons * 8 pounds/gallon = 672 pounds. Weight of liquid X = 36 gallons * 12 pounds/gallon = 432 pounds. Total weight of the liquid = 672 pounds + 432 pounds = 1104 pounds. Finally, let's add the weight of the empty tank to the weight of the liquid to find the total weight of the tank now: Weight of the empty tank = 80 pounds. Total weight of the tank now = 80 pounds + 1104 pounds = 1184 pounds.

To demonstrate this, let's consider the reverse process: starting with several single-stone heaps, repeatedly combine two heaps until only one remains, ensuring the similarity condition is preserved. 1. **Initial Setup**: Assume initially we have n heaps, each containing a single stone. Every heap is of size 1. 2. **Combination Process**: We will iteratively combine the two smallest heaps into one larger heap. 3. **Heap Combination Rule**: Suppose we are combining two heaps of sizes x and y with x leq y. The new combined heap will have size x + y. 4. **Check Size Similarity**: The condition that the new heap size must be similar to the larger of the two combined heaps means: [ x + y leq 2y ] This inequality always holds since x leq y by definition. Therefore, the new heap's size is always at most double the size of the largest heap involved in the combination. 5. **Iterative Process**: Continue this combination process until only one heap remains. Given that each combination step adheres to the size similarity condition, this ensures that at no point do the heaps differ by more than a factor of two. 6. **Final Heap Size**: If the combining process starts with n heaps each of size 1, and in each step two heaps are merged, each combination step reduces the total number of heaps by one: [ text{Number of steps} = n - 1 ] After n - 1 steps, we have one heap of size n. Hence, starting from n single-stone heaps, it is possible to form one heap of size n by combining heaps in a manner that ensures all intermediate steps produce heaps that differ in size by no more than a factor of two.

We will consider the sequence ({c_i}), defined as (c_i = min {a_i, b_i}), and the sum (C_n = c_1 + c_2 + cdots + c_n). Our goal is to determine whether there exist sequences ({a_i}) and ({b_i}) such that both ({A_n}) and ({B_n}) are unbounded while ({C_n}) remains bounded. 2. **Part 1**: **Existence of such sequences**: The sequences ({a_i}) and ({b_i}) **can exist** such that ({A_n}) and ({B_n}) are unbounded while ({C_n}) remains bounded. - Define an arbitrary positive sequence ({c_i}) such that (c_i geq c_{i+1}) and the series (sum_{i=1}^{infty} c_i < infty). - Consider an integer sequence ({k_m}) satisfying (1 = k_1 < k_2 < k_3 < cdots), and ((k_{m+1} - k_m) c_{k_m} geq 1). Define ({a_i}) and ({b_i}) as follows: - When (n) is odd and (k_n leq i < k_{n+1}), set (a_i = c_{k_n}, b_i = c_i). - When (n) is even and (k_n leq i < k_{n+1}), set (a_i = c_i, b_i = c_{k_n}). With these definitions, the following inequalities hold: [ A_{k_n+1} - 1 = A_{k_{n}-1} + (k_{n+1} - k_n) c_{k_n} geq A_{k_n-1} + 1 ] and [ B_{k_{n+1}-1} geq B_{k_n-1} + 1. ] Thus, both (A_n) and (B_n) tend to infinity, while (C_n) (being the sum of a convergent series) remains bounded. Therefore, the existence of such sequences is established. 3. **Part 2**: **Behavior for (b_i = frac{1}{i})**: We need to examine if replacing (b_i) with (frac{1}{i}) alters the conclusion. **Assumption**: The conclusion can change. If only finitely many (i) satisfy (b_i = c_i), then an (I) exists such that (i geq I) implies (c_i = a_i). Therefore, (sum_{i=1}^{infty}c_i = sum_{i=1}^{infty} a_i = +infty), which is a contradiction. If infinitely many (i) fulfill (b_i = c_i), consider a sequence ({k_m}) such that (k_{m+1} geq 2k_m) and (b_{k_m} = c_{k_m}). Given that ({c_i}) is also decreasing, we have: [ sum_{k = k_i + 1}^{k_{i+1}} c_k geq (k_{i+1} - k_i) c_{k_{i+1}} geq frac{1}{2}. ] Therefore, (sum_{i = 1}^{infty} c_i = +infty), causing a contradiction since (sum_{i = 1}^{infty} c_i) must be bounded if (C_n) were bounded. **Conclusion**: Thus, when (b_i = frac{1}{i}), the initial conclusion from Part 1 changes, implying that it is impossible for both ({A_n}) and ({B_n}) to be unbounded while ({C_n}) remains bounded. boxed{}"},{"prompt":"Given cos({αfrac{π}{6}})=frac{1}{3}, then sin({2α+frac{π}{6}})=left( right) A: frac{7}{9} B: frac{7}{9} C: frac{{2sqrt{2}}}{3} D: frac{{2sqrt{2}}}{3}","completion":"Given cos(α - frac{π}{6}) = frac{1}{3}, we want to find sin(2α + frac{π}{6}). 1.

To illustrate this better, consider: - The diagonals of rectangle 16 times 10 intersect, splitting into triangles. - Comparing the ratios of corresponding sides (small 3-to-10 versus larger 7-to-23): - (frac{3}{10} = 0.3) - (frac{7}{23} approx 0.3043) - The slight difference in these ratios results in tiny gaps that add up to a total area discrepancy equivalent to 1 text{cm}^2. 2. **Proof by Visualization and Calculation**: - Converting the 16 times 10 text{cm}^2 rectangle to 23 times 7 text{cm}^2: - By visual means, the gap is identifiable as a parallelogram with an 0.043 text{cm} height at its most critical part. 3. **Method Exploration**: - Consider a generic rectangle with sides (a) and (b) (both natural numbers, (a < b)). By performing similar operations (translating and rotating parts), such sets of rectangles can be found. - When dissecting, we create components such as trapezoids and new rectangles, requiring all to fit uniformly without notable gaps save for tiny tolerances. 4. **Finding Specific Rectangles**: - Examination and verification for specific examples where: - (260) versus (261 text{cm}^2 rightarrow) factors choices: (9 times 29) or (3 times 87): - For (9 times 29): - Choose (x = 13, y = 4 ) - For the given rectangle sides (16 times 10), apply: - Similarly, (272 text{cm}^2): - (boxed{13 times 21}): - This would be verified visually.

We'll consider two cases: ( a > 1 ) and ( 0 < a < 1 ). Preliminary Analysis First, note that the function ( f(x) ) involves a logarithmic expression. For ( f(x) ) to be defined, the argument of the logarithm, ( 6ax^2 - 2x + 3 ), must be positive for all ( x in left[frac{3}{2}, 2right] ): [ 6ax^2 - 2x + 3 > 0 ] Case 1: ( a > 1 ) 1. When ( a > 1 ), the function ( log_a (y) ) is increasing if ( y ) is increasing. So, ( f(x) ) is increasing if ( g(x) = 6ax^2 - 2x + 3 ) is increasing on (left[frac{3}{2}, 2right]). 2. Find the critical points of ( g(x) ): [ g'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(6ax^2 - 2x + 3) = 12ax - 2 ] Set ( g'(x) = 0 ): [ 12ax - 2 = 0 implies x = frac{1}{6a} ] 3. For ( g(x) ) to be increasing on (left[frac{3}{2}, 2right]), ( frac{1}{6a} ) should be to the left of (frac{3}{2}): [ frac{1}{6a} leq frac{3}{2} implies a geq frac{1}{9} ] 4. Since ( a > 1 ), the condition ( a geq frac{1}{9} ) is satisfied naturally if ( a > 1 ). Therefore, for ( a > 1 ), ( a in (1, +infty) ). Case 2: ( 0 < a < 1 ) 1. When ( 0 < a < 1 ), the function ( log_a (y) ) is decreasing if ( y ) is increasing. Hence, ( f(x) ) is increasing if ( g(x) ) is decreasing on (left[frac{3}{2}, 2right]). 2. As before, the critical point is ( x = frac{1}{6a} ). 3. For ( g(x) ) to be decreasing on (left[frac{3}{2}, 2right]), ( frac{1}{6a} ) should be to the right of ( 2 ): [ frac{1}{6a} geq 2 implies a leq frac{1}{12} ] 4.

For the purpose of renovating wing A, all patients in the original wing must be transferred to either wing B or wing C. Also, for additional constraints during the transfer, wing B cannot exceed 3/4 of its capacity, and wing C cannot exceed 5/6 of its capacity. If patients are neither admitted nor discharged during the transfer, what is the maximum occupancy rate, as a simplified fraction, in each wing (B and C) after the transfer is complete?","completion":"Let's start by calculating the number of beds in each wing and the number of beds currently occupied in each wing. Wing A has x beds, and 1/3 of them are occupied, so there are (1/3)x occupied beds in wing A. Wing B has 2x beds, and 1/2 of them are occupied, so there are (1/2)(2x) = x occupied beds in wing B. Wing C has 3x beds, and 1/4 of them are occupied, so there are (1/4)(3x) = (3/4)x occupied beds in wing C. Now, let's calculate the maximum capacity for wing B and wing C after the transfer: Wing B can hold up to 3/4 of its capacity, which is (3/4)(2x) = (3/2)x beds. Wing C can hold up to 5/6 of its capacity, which is (5/6)(3x) = (5/2)x beds. Since all patients from wing A need to be transferred, we have (1/3)x patients to move. Let's see if we can fit all (1/3)x patients into wing B without exceeding its maximum allowed capacity after the transfer: The current occupancy in wing B is x, and the maximum capacity after the transfer is (3/2)x. So, the number of additional patients wing B can accommodate is (3/2)x - x = (1/2)x. Since (1/3)x is less than (1/2)x, all patients from wing A can be transferred to wing B without exceeding its maximum allowed capacity. Therefore, the occupancy rate in wing B after the transfer will be x + (1/3)x = (4/3)x beds occupied. Now, let's calculate the occupancy rate as a fraction of the total capacity in wing B: The occupancy rate in wing B after the transfer is (4/3)x out of 2x, which simplifies to (4/3)x / 2x = (4/3) / 2 = 2/3. Since no patients from wing A need to be transferred to wing C, the occupancy rate in wing C remains the same: The occupancy rate in wing C is (3/4)x out of 3x, which simplifies to (3/4)x / 3x = (3/4) / 3 = 1/4.

Since 50% of the workers are technicians, there are 50 technicians. And since 50% of the workers are non-technicians, there are also 50 non-technicians. Now, 50% of the technicians are permanent employees, so that means 50% of 50 technicians are permanent, which is 25 technicians. Similarly, 50% of the non-technicians are permanent employees, so that means 50% of 50 non-technicians are permanent, which is also 25 non-technicians. Therefore, there are 25 permanent technicians + 25 permanent non-technicians = 50 permanent employees in total. Since there are 100 workers in total and 50 of them are permanent employees, the remaining workers must be temporary employees. So, 100 total workers - 50 permanent employees = 50 temporary employees. To find the percentage of temporary employees, we divide the number of temporary employees by the total number of workers and multiply by 100: (50 temporary employees / 100 total workers) * 100 = 50% Therefore, boxed{50%} of the workers are temporary employees."},{"prompt":"Find the quadratic polynomial, with real coefficients, which has 4 + 2i as a root, and where the coefficient of x^2 is 3.","completion":"Since the polynomial has real coefficients, the other root must be 4 - 2i.

Let mathcal{L} consist of n segments. - We claim that the number of iso-odd triangles with vertices on mathcal{L} does not exceed n/2. 4. **Base Case:** - For n=2 segments, it's clear that the maximum number of iso-odd triangles is 1 (since the triangle would just be the segment itself, treated trivially as a degenerate isosceles triangle). 5. **Inductive Step:** - For general n > 2 where 2 < n leq 1003, assume the theorem holds for lengths < n. - Let PQ be the longest diagonal that is a side of an iso-odd triangle PQS with all vertices on mathcal{L}.

To solve this equation, we first isolate (x): [ x = frac{100 - y}{3} ] 2. For (x) to be a positive integer, (frac{100 - y}{3}) must also be an integer. This implies that (100 - y) must be divisible by 3. 3. Additionally, (y) must be a positive integer. Therefore, (y) must be such that (100 - y) is divisible by 3, and (y) is positive. 4. To determine the permissible values of (y), we solve the congruence: [ 100 - y equiv 0 pmod{3} ] This simplifies to: [ y equiv 100 pmod{3} ] Since (100 div 3 = 33) with a remainder of 1, we have: [ 100 equiv 1 pmod{3} ] [ y equiv 1 pmod{3} ] 5. Therefore, (y) must be of the form: [ y = 3k + 1 ] where (k) is a non-negative integer. 6.

The amount spent on food is 30% of ( T ), so that's ( 0.30T ). The amount spent on other items is also 30% of ( T ), so that's ( 0.30T ). The amount spent on clothing would then be ( T - 0.30T - 0.30T = T(1 - 0.30 - 0.30) = 0.40T ). Now, let's calculate the taxes: - The tax on clothing is 4% of the clothing cost, so that's ( 0.04 times 0.40T ). - There is no tax on food. - The tax on other items is 8% of the cost of other items, so that's ( 0.08 times 0.30T ). The total tax paid is 4% of the total amount spent (excluding taxes), so that's ( 0.04T ). Now we can set up the equation for the total tax paid: [ 0.04 times 0.40T + 0.08 times 0.30T = 0.04T ] [ 0.016T + 0.024T = 0.04T ] [ 0.04T = 0.04T ] This equation is true for any value of ( T ), which means that the taxes on clothing and other items add up to exactly 4% of the total amount spent, as required.

How many of the sets S_0, S_1, S_2, ldots, S_{999} do not contain a perfect square?","completion":"To solve this problem, we start by understanding the pattern of perfect squares and their differences. The difference between consecutive squares can be represented as follows: [ (x + 1)^2 - x^2 = 2x + 1 ] This equation tells us that as x increases, the difference between consecutive squares also increases. Specifically, when x = 50, the difference between consecutive squares is 2(50) + 1 = 101. This is a key observation because it means that starting from 50^2, every consecutive square will be more than 100 apart. Since each set S_i covers a range of 100 integers, this implies that starting from S_{25} (because 50^2 = 2500 falls in the range of S_{25}), not every set will contain a perfect square. To determine the sets that contain at least one perfect square, we note the following: 1. The first 26 sets, from S_0 to S_{25}, each contain at least one perfect square because the difference between consecutive squares in this range is less than or equal to 100. 2. For squares above 50^2, we need to find the largest square less than 100,000 (the upper limit for S_{999}). The largest such square is 316^2 because 316^2 < 100,000 and (316 + 1)^2 > 100,000. This means that the sets from S_{26} to S_{315} potentially contain perfect squares. Given that there are 316 - 50 = 266 sets from S_{26} to S_{315} that contain a perfect square (since we start counting from S_{0} and the square 50^2 is in S_{25}, we subtract 50 from 316), we can calculate the number of sets without a perfect square as follows: [ 1000 - 26 - 266 = 708 ] Therefore, there are boxed{708} sets among S_0, S_1, S_2, ldots, S_{999} that do not contain a perfect square."},{"prompt":"Given that the line l passes through the intersection point M of the lines l_{1}: 3x+4y11=0 and l_{2}: 2x+3y8=0.

Let's explore the number of possible placements and the constraints from attacking: - Each piece can attack up to 20 cells. - Therefore, for one piece, it can eliminate up to 20 possible positions for every other piece to avoid an attack. 4. Consider the placement combinations: - The total number of ways to place 20 pieces on 10000 cells without any restriction is given by the combination formula ( binom{10000}{20} ). This is the number of ways to choose 20 positions from 10000, which is approximately: [ binom{10000}{20} = frac{10000!}{20!(10000-20)!} ] 5. Now, evaluate the constraint: - For each pair of pieces ( (i, j) ), where piece ( i ) attacks piece ( j ), there can be at most ( 20 times 20 = 400 ) such attacking positions. 6. We calculate an upper bound for the number of \\"bad\\" placements where at least one attack occurs: - Number of ways to place the first piece is 10000, - For the second piece, avoiding attacks removes up to 20 positions per piece; - Therefore, we calculate approximately the number of ways considering attack constraints: [ 20 cdot 19 cdot 20 cdot 10000 cdot 9998 cdot 9997 cdot ldots cdot 9981 ] - This can be simplified into evaluating if it’s less than the ( 10000 times 9999 times ldots times 9981 ), the combinations without constraints.

To increase the numerator (3) by 12%, we calculate 12% of 3 and add it to 3: 12% of 3 = 0.12 * 3 = 0.36 New numerator = 3 + 0.36 = 3.36 To decrease the denominator (4) by 2%, we calculate 2% of 4 and subtract it from 4: 2% of 4 = 0.02 * 4 = 0.08 New denominator = 4 - 0.08 = 3.92 Now, the new fraction is: New fraction = New numerator / New denominator = 3.36 / 3.92 To find the value of this new fraction, we simply divide 3.36 by 3.92: New fraction value ≈ 3.36 / 3.92 ≈ 0.8571 (rounded to four decimal places) Therefore, the value of the fraction after the changes is approximately boxed{0.8571} ."},{"prompt":"Eight identical squares are arranged to form a larger rectangle ABCD.

Specifically, let's take: [ 1 = frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{6} ] This is a well-known representation using Egyptian fractions. 2. **Finding New Fractions:** Next, we will use the strategy of breaking down a unit fraction further into a sum of two other unit fractions. This technique can be used repeatedly to generate new representations: Example: [ frac{1}{n} = frac{1}{n+1} + frac{1}{n(n+1)} ] 3. **Applying the Strategy:** Let's apply this strategy to our initial fraction representation. Start by breaking down some fractions in the initial set: - For ( frac{1}{3} ): [ frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{12} ] - For ( frac{1}{4} ): [ frac{1}{4} = frac{1}{5} + frac{1}{20} ] 4. **Combining the Results:** Combining the results from the previous steps, we obtain: [ 1 = frac{1}{2} + left( frac{1}{4} + frac{1}{12} right) + frac{1}{6} ] Replace ( frac{1}{4} ) with its decomposition: [ 1 = frac{1}{2} + left( frac{1}{5} + frac{1}{20} right) + frac{1}{12} + frac{1}{6} ] Thus, we can write: [ 1 = frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{5} + frac{1}{6} + frac{1}{12} + frac{1}{20} ] 5. **Repeat the Process:** By repeating this process on any fraction in the set repeatedly, we can always generate another representation. For example, we can take ( frac{1}{5} ) and decompose it further: [ frac{1}{5} = frac{1}{6} + frac{1}{30} ] Then updating our sum, we have: [ 1 = frac{1}{2} + left( frac{1}{6} + frac{1}{30} right) + frac{1}{6} + frac{1}{12} + frac{1}{20} ] Which simplifies to: [ 1 = frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{6} + frac{1}{12} + frac{1}{20} + frac{1}{30} ] 6. **Extending to Infinitely Many Representations:** Given that this transformation can be applied to any unit fraction in the representation and each application introduces new unit fractions, we can generate an infinite number of different representations of 1. This is because at each step, we replace a fraction with two smaller fractions such that no previous fractions repeat. # Conclusion: We have shown that it is possible to represent 1 as ( frac{1}{5} + frac{1}{a_1} + frac{1}{a_2} + cdots + frac{1}{a_n} ) in infinitely many different ways by iteratively breaking down the fractions into sums of two smaller fractions.

Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Consider Odd Numbers**: We observe that if we select only odd numbers from the set {1, 3, 5, ..., 99}, then: - Any sum of two odd numbers results in an even number. - The double of an odd number is an even number. - This means no odd number can be represented as the sum or twice another odd number. There are exactly (50) odd numbers within this range: 1, 3, 5, ldots, 99. 2. **Pigeonhole Principle Analysis**: Let's assume there could be more than 50 team members under the given constraints. - If there were (51) team members, denote their numbers as ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{51} ). Define: ( {a_{51} - a_1, a_{51} - a_2, ldots, a_{51} - a_{50}} ). This yields 51 differences in total. Additionally, we have the 51 initial numbers themselves, resulting in (51 + 50 = 101) unique values. 3. **Range Constraint**: All these values must lie within the range 1 to 100. - By the Pigeonhole Principle, having 101 distinct values in a range of 100 numbers means there must be at least one value that repeats. However, the unique differences calculated cannot overlap since ( a_{51} - a_i ) (where ( a_i ) is initially unique) and any initial set of numbers do not intersect. 4. **Contradiction**: Hence, if ( a_i = a_{51} - a_j ), we get ( a_i + a_j = a_{51} ). Similarly, ( a_{51} = 2a_i ). Both scenarios oppose our initial condition where no number is the sum of two others or double any other. 5. **Verification of Constraint**: Since having 51 team members results in contradictions under given constraints, the maximum possible number of members ensuring no number is the sum or double of any other number is efficiently selecting just the odd numbers. Conclusion: Hence, the maximum number of team members that satisfies the condition is [ boxed{50} ]"},{"prompt":"Find the largest real number ( x ) such that ( sqrt[3]{x} + sqrt[3]{4 x} = 1 ).","completion":"To find the largest real number ( x ) such that (sqrt[3]{x} + sqrt[3]{4-x} = 1), 1. **Cube both sides of the equation**: [ left(sqrt[3]{x} + sqrt[3]{4-x}right)^3 = 1^3 ] 2. **Expand the left-hand side using the binomial theorem**: [ left(sqrt[3]{x} + sqrt[3]{4-x}right)^3 = left( sqrt[3]{x} right)^3 + 3 left( sqrt[3]{x} right)^2 left( sqrt[3]{4-x} right) + 3 left( sqrt[3]{x} right) left( sqrt[3]{4-x} right)^2 + left( sqrt[3]{4-x} right)^3 ] 3. **Simplify the expanded form**: [ x + 3 sqrt[3]{x^2(4-x)} + (4-x) = 1 ] 4. **Combine like terms**: [ x + 4 - x + 3 sqrt[3]{x(4-x)} = 1 ] [ 4 + 3 sqrt[3]{x(4-x)} = 1 ] 5. **Isolate the term containing the cube root**: [ 3 sqrt[3]{x(4-x)} = 1 - 4 ] [ 3 sqrt[3]{x(4-x)} = -3 ] [ sqrt[3]{x(4-x)} = -1 ] 6. **Cube both sides again to remove the cube root**: [ left( sqrt[3]{x(4-x)} right)^3 = (-1)^3 ] [ x(4-x) = -1 ] 7. **Solve the quadratic equation**: [ x(4-x) = -1 ] [ x^2 - 4x = 1 ] [ x^2 - 4x - 1 = 0 ] 8. **Use the quadratic formula**: [ x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ] Here, ( a = 1 ), ( b = -4 ), and ( c = -1 ).

The set S is initially {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}. For any number x in this set, its complementary number to reach a sum of 12 is 12 - x.

Each number from 1 to 11, except for 6, has a unique complementary number in the set such that their sum equals 12. The special case here is the number 6. Since 6 + 6 = 12, and the problem states that two different numbers must be selected, choosing 6 does not contribute to achieving a sum of 12 with two distinct numbers. By removing 6 from the set, we do not eliminate any potential pairs that sum to 12 because 6 can only pair with itself to reach 12, which is not allowed.

Cependant, il existe également de nombreux films français qui traitent d'autres sujets, tels que la société, la politique, l'histoire, la culture, la famille, l'amitié, etc. Chaque réalisateur a sa propre vision et ses propres préoccupations, ce qui se reflète dans la diversité des films produits en France. En fin de compte, le sujet abordé dans un film dépend des choix artistiques du réalisateur et de la vision qu'il souhaite transmettre au public.

Characters from Cuphead, Bendy and the Ink Machine, and many other possible character from other franchises might pop up, and they belong to their respective franchises, so again, I ask you to support the creators of the characters. In other words, this is fan fiction, don’t freak out. We open in on Mugman sleeping, but then he hears his alarm go off. “My name is Mugman Grace, and I’m a jujutsu sorcerer.”, He narrates, while we see Mugmans daily routine play in the background. “What? Too much. Okay, well, let’s take it from the top.”, Mugman continues to narrate, as we rewind to flashbacks of Chapter One. We see Mugman eating the “pickle”, Mugman fighting Bendy, and Mugman about to activate his domain. “A few months ago, I ate a special grade cursed object, which incarnated inside me, and turned me into a vessel for the king of curses, Jules. After that, I was set up for a secret execution, but only after I ate all of Jules, which would take a while. After that, I became a jujutsu sorcerer. And for the past three months, I’ve been a grade 2 sorcerer. So far I’ve consumed nine out of twenty fingers, so I have about 11 fingers left to eat. Or, I’d say about another three months left to live. But I’ll make it worth it by making the world a better place. Lemme introduce you to my squad.”, Mugman continues to narrate, as we see Mugman eat breakfast. An image appears of Cuphead, before Mugman introduces Cuphead. “This is my brother, Cuphead. He’s a grade two sorcerer, and his cursed technique allows him to…do stuff with robots or something, I honestly forgot because he doesn’t show it off much.” Then, an image of Bendy lands on Cupheads picture. “This is Bendy. He’s my friend, and a grade four sorcerer, so he’s pretty tough. His cursed technique allows him to command people or objects to do stuff by saying words from the English vocabulary.”, Mugman says, before an image of Lion lands on top of the picture of Bendy and Cuphead. “And this is my teacher, or sensei, Lion. His cursed technique allows him to channel his cursed energy into certain parts of his body, and protect it or reinforce it. It can also double the damage he does.”, Lion says. “And my cursed technique…is pretty hard to explain, so I’ll try my best.”, Mugman says, before a presentation appears. Mugman appears in a teacher outfit with glasses, and adjusts them before he turns on the presentation. “My cursed technique has three functions: Dismantle, Cleave and Erase. Dismantle is one big clean cut. Cleave is like a grid of slices, and they basically chop up my opponent into pieces. And Erase…erases the space-like, LITERAL space-in front of me, and it makes me dash pretty fast. Unfortunately, this last one I don’t use too much, so, it doesn’t have much use.”, Mugman explains. “Yes, rag doll number seventy eight in the back?”, Mugman says, pointing out into a class full of training dummies. “Are you gonna talk about cursed tools, domain expansions, and cursed energy?”, the dummy says, obviously being controlled by Mugman. “Oh, yeah. Uhh, not now, but when we come to those, we’ll explain it. Now, are we all up to speed? Good! Now, I gotta get back to eating, cause today’s a mission. And my partner is my brother. You’ve all met him, I’m sure.”, Mugman says, before we cut back to him putting on his uniform. “Hey, Mugman? You done yet? I’ve been waiting for like, twenty minutes.”, Cuphead says, leaning against Mugmans door. “Yeah, I’m coming, Cuphead.”, Mugman says, before he grabs EWF( Earth, Wind and Fire. Mugmans cursed tool infused with cursed energy. It’s a double sided combat knife), and walks out his door. “C’mon.”, Cuphead says, and they walk out, and head towards heir mission. A hour later, they arrive. “So, Cuphead? What’s the deal here?”Mugman asked, looking at the old office building. “Same as always, Mug.”, Cuphead said disinterested. “Cursed Spirit sightings and possible location of Jules finger?”, Mugman asked, letting out a sigh of tiredness. “Right on the money, Mug.”, Cuphead said. “I don’t know why we have to deal with the grade four curses…”, Mugman said mopingly. “Me too, but you don’t see me crying. Now come on, Mugman. We got a finger for you to eat.”, Cuphead said, before he headed inside. They walked through the halls, while Mugman was staring at his phone, watching TikTok. They turn a corner, and see a grade four curse. “It’s not the one we’re looking for.”, Cuphead said casually, walking towards it. Mugman, still looking down at his phone, sliced through it with ease, and kept walking. “Hey, Cuphead? After this, can we get McDonalds?”, Mugman asked, looking at Cuphead. “Didn’t you JUST eat breakfast, Mugman?”, Cuphead asked, annoyed. At the same time, a grade three spirit lunged at Cuphead from behind. “12:00 o’clock, Cuphead.”, Mugman said casually. Cuphead, without even looking away from Mugman, smashed the cursed spirit into pieces with one hand. “Also, yeah, but I want a McDonalds biscuit. Oh, and a cookie!”, Mugman said. Cuphead decided for a moment, and answered, “Fine with me, but you gotta talk to Lion about that.”, Cuphead said. “You know how he is when you eat out without him, Mug.”, Cuphead added. “Alright.”, Mugman agreed. And so, they kept walking. They eventually reached the main part of the office, and they found the finger, just sitting in the middle of the room, all alone. “It’s a trap.”, Cuphead said. “Oh, really, Captain Obvious? And what made it apparent that this is a trap?”, Mugman said sarcastically. “Fine then. Be that way.”, Cuphead said, walking over to the finger. “You literally just said that it’s a trap, and you still go for it? Are you stupid?”, Mugman asked. “No, I’m strong. That’s why.”, Cuphead said, crouching down to grab the finger. But as he touched the finger, he felt plastic. “It’s a dud.”, Cuphead said, before a grade four cursed spirit crashed from the wall above, lunging down on Cuphead. Cuphead dashed back, as he saw the cursed spirit laugh at the two for taking the bait. “Okay, you’re strong, but you’re not smart.”, Mugman said casually. “Let’s just exorcise this thing already.”, Cuphead said, annoyed at Mugman. “I was hoping you’d say that.”, Mugman said, before the two dashed and disappeared. Mugman appeared behind the cursed spirit, and hit him with a Cleave. He then kicked the spirit into Cuphead, who used his technique to capture the spirit. However, the spirit used its technique, and phased through the cage Cuphead had made. Mugman used Erase and dashed toward the cursed spirit, sending it out the window. He then dashed down, and took out EWF, and tried to cut off the cursed spirits head. However, he made EWF phase through Mugmans hand, and unphased it at the perfect time to cut off Mugmans hand. Mugman let go of the cursed spirit and used Reverse Cursed Technique to heal and regenerate his hand. Cuphead jumped down as well, and grabbed Mugmans hands. He then quickly scan Mugman and threw him down to kick the cursed spirit again. This time, Mugman made a donut out of the cursed spirit, putting a hole through the spirit. Mugman landed on the ground firmly, and dashed away, careful not to get crushed under the cursed spirit. Meanwhile, Cuphead, still falling with the cursed spirit, he created a whip out of the falling debris, and sent cursed energy through the rope, and hit the spirit the exact time the cursed energy had reached the end of the rope and hit the spirit, creating a Black Flash. The monster was smashed into the ground, and Cuphead landed easily. “Is it over?”, Mugman asked. Then, the spirit began to get back up, healing the donut hole in its belly. “Nope.”, Cuphead said. Mugman then began to think on how to defeat this thing. If his duo attack didn’t work, he might have to use his domain expansion, but he can’t use it while Cupheads around. So, Mugman made a risky move. “I’ll take it on myself, you go and get Bendy.”, Mugman said, dead serious. “Mugman,you’re joking. There is no way in heaven or hell you’re taking on this thing.”, Cuphead said. “Exactly, I’m just buying some time. Go. Get. Bendy.”, Mugman said. Cuphead quickly left. “Alright, cursed spirit. It’s time to exorcise you.”, Mugman said. Mugman stood firmly, and put out his hands, focusing his energy while doing so. “Domain Expansion…”, Mugman said carefully. But as Mugman was about to finish the domain expansion, he saw the cursed spirit was about to unleash its own domain expansion. “Alright, then!”, Mugman said, smirking. “RIGID COFFIN OF THE DEVIL HIMSELF!”, Mugman said, as his domain began to shape, clashing with the cursed spirits domain expansion, “The Cobweb of Asinine Angels.” Mugman hits the sprit with a dismantle, sending a line of lava the spirits way, but the spirit blocks it with a chain from his domain. Then, the cursed spirit sends out his hands, also sending two chains at Mugman. Mugman dodges him, and tries to hit the cursed spirit with a Cleave. The spirit attempts to block it, but is still hit. The spirit then begins to regenerate, as he starts raising more chains to try and attack Mugman with. Meanwhile, Mugman is panicking, trying to make his domain stable, since it’s running out of energy. Mugman prepares one final attack, but it’s one he hasn’t used before. “Cursed Energy Charge: Red.”, Mugman says, holding out his hand like a gun. A ball made of pure cursed energy begins to form at the tip of Mugmans finger, and then Mugman says, “Blast.” The blast is blasted, and the cursed spirit is destroyed, leaving only the finger. Mugman lets go of his domain, and he falls to the floor. But before he passes out, he grabs the finger, and he gulps it down. Then, Mugman passes out. Mugman wakes up in his dorm, feeling burnt out. Mugman looks around, and sees Bendy at his side, waiting for him to wake up. Bendy looks back at Mugman, to see that he’s awake. “Mugman, you alright? You managed to defeat a special grade curse. So I’m guessing that you aren’t.”, Bendy says, seemingly tired. “Wait…that was a special grade…? But I thought it was-“, Mugman asked, before Bendy cut him off, stating, “Grade four? When normal, weak curses usually around grade four or three eat a special grade object, they usually get infused with that cursed objects power. That’s why it was so strong.”, Bendy said. “Wow…how do you know that…?”, Mugman asked, staring at the ceiling. “It’s common knowledge among sorcerers, Mug.”, Bendy said. But, he was actually just reading from a book about curses. “Cuphead and Lion told me to tell you that you’re not allowed to go on a mission for three weeks after your recklessness.”, Bendy said. “What…?! But I got rid of the special-grade…! I should be…like…promoted…! You can get promoted in jujutsu sorcery, right…?”, Mugman asked, sad. “Well, it’s not like jail, Mug. You can’t beat up the biggest, baddest, toughest guy and expect to be the strongest. It’s not like that. You gotta earn it by first taking down small fry. So, your on downtime for three weeks. Think of it like…vacation, Mug.”, Bendy said, getting up, and leaving. “Oh, yeah. One more thing. Lion told me that you should focus your downtime on training, since you have yet to actually train.”, Bendy said, before leaving Mugmans room. Mugman laid there for a few seconds, before getting off the side of his bed. “A special-grade curse, huh? Gotta say, Mug-brat, I’m impressed. Maybe you’ll actually have a chance to beat me once I leave your body. Or, take control. Either way, I’ll win in the end.”, Jules said, with one of the mini mouths on Mugman. “Is all you do just hype yourself, Jules? You cannot go a day without glazing yourself, can you?”, Mugman said, annoyed. “Hey, I was the greatest sorcerer in history. If I can hype myself, who can?”, Jules said smugggishly. “Oh, I don’t know, maybe people you actually let leave ALIVE.”, Mugman said, as he began to put on his uniform. “Mug-brat, are you deaf? Your classmate said that you’re on break, so what’s the reason for the suit?”, Jules asked confused, but still smug. “He can’t tell me what to do, so I’m gonna go talk to the king of the jungle.”, Mugman said, putting on his shoes. “Right here, pal.”, Jules said, before laughing. “I’m talking about Lion, you Agamemnon.”, Mugman said, before he whacked Jules mouth. “Yeesh. Tough crowd.”, Jules replied, before his mouth disappeared. Mugman began to walk towards lions office, both angry and scared about the conversation ahead. He walked into lions office. “Hey, Mug, what’s up?”, Lion said, filing some paperwork. “Um, Lion, I wanted to talk to you about my three weeks off.”, Mugman said. “Alright, spit.”, Lion said, preparing to listen. “So, I know that I was reckless, and I took on a special grade spirit-and won, by the way-, and almost died, and I gotta recover properly, but I gotta get back out there. I mean, I probably have three, or, if we find them quickly, 2 months left to live! I don’t wanna spend even SOME of that time just sitting around, throwing a ball at a wall! I wanna make a difference, and change the world, make it better for people, and for those people’s children, and for those children’s children!”, Mugman argued. “I see…”, Lion said. “Before I die, I wanna help people, make a change! Like you! Your a big part in this, making a the world a better place, and you’re not letting me help! I find that very, very confusing, Lion! So, please! Let me help! I’m string, and you could do it with me!”, Mugman argued again. “…Mugman.”, Lion began. “Do you like stories?”, Lion asked. “Uh, yeah…? But, what’s that have to do with-“, Mugman asked, before Lion cut him off. “Let me tell you a story, then, Mugman. A story about a young sorcerer, who wanted to change the world.”, Lion said. We cut to 2007, in Japan. We see two young sorcerers walking down the street. “So, what are we clowning around for, Lion”? The other sorcerer said. We then see a young, second grade sorcerer Lion walking down the street, drinking water. “What teach’ told us to do, Mickey. Just get rid of some of the cursed spirits in the area.”, Lion said to his best friend, Mickey. “This is so stupid. I say we just get rid of the people in the area, then boom, no cursed sprints in the area.”, Mickey said annoyed. “Yeah, well, we’re not like the police or something.”, Lion said, drinking from his water bottle. “Yeah, because we’re something better-Jujutsu sorcerers.”, Mickey said. “Wanna hit the arcade after this to make you feel better, BaAaBy?”, Lion said, treating Mickey like a cranky toddler. “Shut up, Lion. But fine.”, Mickey said, groaning. “Cool.”, Lion said, throwing his water bottle in the air, and then evaporating it. “Alright. We’re here.”, Mickey said, standing up straight. “Alright, let’s kick some cursed butt.”, Lion said, before walking in. “Yeah, what you said.”, Mickey said tiredly, before following behind. Lion takes care of a grade four curse, and Mickey turns it into a ball, and swallows it. “Blech. It’s so gross that it almost makes you laugh.”, Mickey said, rubbing his throat. “But it’s worth it, cause then you can-“, Lion said, before Lion and Mickey said, “Control the curse and make it fight.”, at the same time. “Yeah, I know, Lion. But they taste disgusting.”, Mickey said. “They taste like literal trash.”, Mickey added. “Well, they’re pure negativity, so maybe that’s the reason.”, Lion said jokingly. “Well, maybe we need to get rid of the source of the negativity.”, Mickey said. “…you know we can’t kill non-sorcerers, Mick. That’s wrong.”, Lion said, now serious. “You have to make two wrongs to make a right, Right?”, Mickey said, now facing Lion. “Sometimes two wrongs can make three wrongs, Mick.”, Lion said. “It would be the easiest way. They don’t have any curse energy, let alone a technique. So, why can’t we get rid of the people that make the curses? Why can’t we get rid of the source of the problem?”, Mickey said, now angry. “Cause it’s not right. If we kill all non-sorcerers, jujutsu wouldn’t exist, the world would end, and eventually, we would become the humans, and curses would still linger.”, Lion said. “It would still be better with no people. You could do it Lion.”, Mickey said. “You could get rid of all non-sorcerers. You could make the world a better place. You could help save the world from the evil that lives, breathes, eats, rids on the world. Non-sorcerers.”, Mickey explained. “Mickey, it just isn’t right.”, Lion said. “Are you strong because your Lion? Or are you Lion because you’re strong?”, Mickey asked. “What are you trying to say?”, Lion asked. “I’m asking if your strength defines who you are. Because it doesn’t. One day, Lion. I’ll make the world a better place, I just have to make it.”, Mickey explained. “I wanna help people. I wanna make a change. Like you. You’re a big part in this, making a the world a better place, and you’re not letting me help. I find that very, very confusing, Lion. So, please. Let me help. I’m strong, and you could do it with me.”, Mickey asked. “Help me eliminate all non-sorcerers.”, Mickey asked again. A moment of silence fell upon the two, before Lion replied, saying, “Killing innocent people, regardless of whether they’re sorcerers or not, doesn’t solve the root problem. It only perpetuates a cycle of hatred and fear. We have to be better. We have to find another way. I’m sorry, Mickey, I can’t. I just can’t. My hands are tied, and you don’t see your error.”, Lion said. “Fine then. If you don’t stand by me, you stand in front of me. You’re in my way.”, Mickey said, beginning to ready his Cursed Technique to fight. “Mickey, please. You’re my friend. I don’t wanna fight you.”, Lion said, preparing his cursed technique for defense, not wanting to hurt Mickey. “I wouldn’t wanna fight me either.”, Mickey said, before sending out a grade three curse at Lion. Lion dodged, and tried to reason with Mickey. “Mickey, come on! This isn’t you.”, Lion said, outrunning the curse chasing him. “You’re right, Lion. This isn’t me. This is the new me.”, Mickey said, and with a swift motion of his hand, the curse swept Lion into a wall. Lion used his cursed technique to reinforce his body in order to not take damage. “Mickey, listen to what you’re saying. You want to kill innocent people to make a better place.”, Lion said, dashing towards Mickey, preparing to disarm him. “You have to get rid of non-innocents to make innocents.”, Mickey said. Lion jumped up, and prepared to kick Mickey. But just about when he was gonna kick, he stopped. “Mickey, please. I’m your friend. Let me help.”, Lion said, holding onto Mickeys shoulder. “I don’t need any help.”, Mickey said, brushing off lions hand. “And I’m not your friend.”, Mickey said, before Mickey left, not just the building. But lions friendship. The jujutsu high school. We then cut back to present day. “It’s been five years ever since that day occurred.”, Lion said, tears running down his face. “Your room…it was Mickeys. It was ours.”, Lion said. “So, what happened to Mickey…?”, Mugman asked, feeling a lump grow in his throat. “I don’t know. I haven’t seen him since.”, Lion said. “I tell you this, Mugman, so that you learn that your strength does not define who you are, it does not define the world. Your choices define what you are. And what you do.”, Lion said, now crying. “I…I understand, sensei.”, Mugman said, now also tearing up. “During these three weeks…can you teach me all you know?”, Mugman asked. “I’d be happy to, Mugman.”, Lion said, putting down his pen. And so, Mugman trained relentlessly. And then his suspension was up. We cut to three weeks later, with Mugman, Bendy, and Cuphead heading to Kanto, to go and recruit another sorcerer from their sister school. “So, who are we picking up?”, Mugman asked, while playing Flappy Bird on his phone. “Alice.”, Cuphead said, looking out of the window. “Oh. Does she have a cursed technique?”, Mugman asked. “Yeah, obviously, Mugman.”, Cuphead replied. “What is it?”, Mugman asked. “It’d be too good to spoil you, Mugman. But just know this: When she gets worked up…her power is comparable to Jules.”, Bendy said. “Whaaaat? You’re lying.”, Mugman said, not believing Bendy. “Trust me, Mugman.”, Bendy said. Then, the train stops, and the location says that they’ve arrived in Kanto. “Alright, let’s go to our sister school.”, Cuphead said, leading the group. “How is it that you’re a grade two sorcerer leading the group, but I’m a grade THREE sorcerer being led by a lower class?”, Bendy said frustrated. “Dunno, don’t care.”, Cuphead said. Eventually, after about an hour of walking, they arrive at their sister school. Cuphead and his gang walk in, and check in with this schools principal/sensei. They then go to Alice’s room. Mugman knocks on the door. “Ugh, who is it?”, a voice said from inside the room. “Chicka-chicka boom boom.”, Bendy said out of nowhere. Suddenly, the room got quiet, and Alice opened the door. “Bendy?”, Alice asked. “Hey, you remembered the signal!”, Bendy said happily. “And uh…who are these losers?”, Alice asked, whispering to Bendy. “Oh, there with me. We need to recruit you for a mission.”, Bendy whispered back. “Oh.”, Alice said. Alice stepped back, and looked at Mugman and Cuphead. “And you guys are…?”, Alice asked. Mugman raised his hand, and introduced himself. “Hi! I’m Mugman, Grade Two sorcerer!”, Mugman said happily. “Nice to meet you.”, Mugman added, extending his hand. Alice then glared at Cuphead. “I’m Cuphead.”, Cuphead said, looking away. Alice stared at the two for a minute. “This…’Mugman’ guy looks weird. Definitely the kid that ate his own boogers. Does he even have a cursed technique? And Cuphead thinks that he’s the GOAT, by just telling me his name.”, Alice thought. “Why am I always stuck with the weird ones.”, Alice said, sighing. “We need you cause your ‘apparently’, pretty strong.”, Mugman said, with skepticism and sarcasm in his voice. Alice gritted her teeth at Mugman. “And what’s that supposed to mean, you little narc?”, Alice said, angry. “What I’m saying is that I don’t believe that you’re that tough that you could rival Jules in power. I mean…”, Mugman says, about to say something to set Alice off. “…you’re a girl!”, Mugman said. Alice’s top blew off. “Alright then, dippy. Let’s spar right here, right now. “Okay.”, Mugman said. Alice and Mugman then head out into the field. Mugman stands still,e doe ting Alice to be on the level of a grade one sorcerer. Alice ready her stance. “Cursed Technique: Gamblers Monkey.”, Alice states, before a pair of die appear before Alice. Alice then pulls out one of her weapons, and places it down. “Bet one of your items, or anything that you have.”, Alice said. Mugman, underestimating her, places down EWF. Suddenly, both of their items are sucked into the dice, and Alice pockets the dice. “Domain Expansion: All Bets Are Off.”, Alice said, activating her domain expansion. Suddenly, a black dome surrounds the two, and the two are placed in a card game of War. “What the? Why are we playing War?”, Mugman thought. Mugman dashed to get up and attack Alice, but was quickly placed back down into the chair. “Ah, ah, ah.”, Alice said, waving her finger. “You already made a bet. Now you have to play the game.”, Alice said. Suddenly, Mugmans mind was filled with the rules of her technique. Cursed Technique: Gamblers Monkey When this Cursed Technique activates, it summons a pair of die. After the die are summoned, the two people fighting are forced to put one thing they have on a “bet”, that if either of them lose the “bet”, that object or anything that they had bet is destroyed beyond repair. When both players have placed their “bets”, the person with this cursed technique (gamblers monkey), activates their Domain Expansion: All Bets Are Off, which puts the opponent and the other opponent either in a boxing arena, a game of cards (can be blackjack, poker or war), or puts them back at the betting stage to bet one more item. If either of them lose any of the challenges or refuses to put down something to bet, that person, along with their item(or items that they betted), are eradicated. If either of the players lose in one of the battles, they, and their betted item, are eradicated. The Domain Expansion for this cursed technique is automatic, and does not require cursed energy to activate or form. “Woah, this is how the game functions, huh?”, Mugman said, looking at Alice. “Yup, glad that I gave you the rules, huh?”, Alice said with a smirk. “Sure.”, Mugman said, before he drew a card, and they both began to play the game. As they were playing the game, Mugman thought about how unique her technique was. It wasn’t one made for fighting, it was made for gambling, Which he thought was honestly pretty cool. It’s not everyday that you get to see cursed techniques like this, let alone, cursed techniques that aren’t inherited or copied. Mugman put down a card, and with that swift motion, Mugman won the game. The domain dissipates, and the pair of die fly out of Alice’s pocket. Suddenly, Mugmans EWF drops in front of him, while the dice holding Alice’s weapons shivers, and then cracks, and dies. Alice grits her teeth, while Mugman hold EWF in his hand, looking at its new design and material. “Woah, what happened to my weapon?”, Mugman said, asking Alice. Alice, still angry about her loss, answers Mugman, “When you win against my technique, it enhances the item or whatever you betted by tenfold.”, Alice said. “Cool!”, Mugman stated. “Alice…”, Mugman began to ask. “I want to gamble again.”, Mugman asked. Alice looked up. “Half of my lifespan, if I lose, goes away. If I win, my cursed energy is increased by tenfold, and remains that way from now on.”, Mugman said. “MUGMAN, ARE YOU CRAZY?! YOU DONT WANNA BET LIKE THAT, THATS TOO RISKY!”, Bendy yelled. Alice grinned. “THIS IS WHAT I LIKE TO SEE! I LIKE TO SEE HIGH STAKES!”, Alice yelled with a grin. “I accept your bet, Mugman. If I win, I get half of your remaining lifespan, but if I lose, the cursed energy that you receive that multiplies your cursed energy tenfold will be my own cursed energy!”, Alice yelled. Mugman also grinned. “Let’s do it!”, he yelled. Alice threw out the die once more, and the die absorbed Mugmans cursed energy, and half of his life. The other die absorbed Alice’s Cursed energy. “Domain Expansion: All Bets Are Off!”, Alice yelled. A black dome surrounded the two, and the two were placed into a boxing ring. “This is it, Mugman. This is the coin toss that decides our fate. Let’s hope that we win.”, Alice said, grinning. “Good luck.”, Mugman said, getting into a boxing stance. “I don’t need luck. I’m full of it.”, Alice said, starting off the boxing match with a right hook, followed by a jab to the stomach. Mugman blocks the right hook, but is punched in his gut. Mugman retaliates with 3 right jabs, followed by a left hook, and three right jabs, all to the face. Alice blocked the last few, after being hit by the first few. Alice tried to juke Mugman by winding up a left hook, only to throw a right jab. Mugman didn’t fall for it though, dodging the right jab, before mollywhopping Alice in the face, sending her into the ropes of the ring. Alice relaxed for a minute, before pushing back on the ropes, sending herself flying into Mugman. Alice threw a flurry of punches at Mugman, with some landing, and some being blocked. Mugman threw a right hook at the same time Alice also threw a right hook, leaving them at a temporary standstill. “You’re good. You’ve been practicing?”, Alice asked sarcastically. “You know, I’m something of an athlete myself.”, Mugman answered, before following a jab that lasted for 0.01 seconds. Alice was sent back by the jab, both surprised and injured. Alice let herself fall down to avoid another jab by Mugman, before catching her self, and pushing herself back up to land a left hook on Mugman. Mugman was sent back, but caught himself on the rings ropes. Mugman dodged a punch to the face, and rapidly punched Alice in the stomach, before landing on uppercut. Alice fell down, but quickly got up to avoid losing. “I gotta dodge his punches for a while, until I can regain my stamina.”, Alice thought, dodging a jab from Mugman. Mugman slowed his jabs, trying to predict where she would dodge. But as Mugman tried to land another punch, he reimbursed the words of his sensei. “Don’t let your strength define you. Let your choices define who you are.”, Mugman thought, imaging his sensei fighting by his side. Mugman landed multiple punches and labs on Alice, and with landing the final blow, Alice was done. But, as Alice accepted her defeat, she felt something catch her by the collar. It was Mugman. “Stand still for ten seconds.”, Mugman instructed. Alice, in a daze, didn’t answer, but just stood there. Mugman walked over to one of the corners of the ring, and began to smash his head in. “He…he’s…he’s trying to initiate a tie…”, Alice thought, as she felt her legs become numb. And with the last blow to Mugmans head, both of the contestants fell to the floor, bruised and battered. The domain fell, and the two received their betted items back, not enhanced. Mugman used his Reversed Cursed Technique to heal his injuries, with Alice doing the same. “Why?”, Alice asked. “You had me on the final thread. Why give it up? Why give up ten times the energy you have now? Why give up the best statistics in jujutsu history?”, Alice asked, genuinely curious. “A wise person once told me that your strength doesn’t define who you are. It’s your choices. My strength is defined by my choices, and my choices defined me. I know what power can do to a person. It isn’t pretty. I didn’t want either of us to become absorbed by power, and do something risky that might chance the future maybe fifty, or a hundred years later. The future I want to make is the future that will become. A better world.”, Mugman said. Alice got up, dusting herself off. “Most sorcerers I know would’ve taken that chance and stomped my face in. But…you’re different. You’re the most respectable sorcerer I know now.”, Alice said, extending out her hand this time. “I’m Alice. Special Grade Sorcerer.”, Alice said with a smile on her face. Mugman shook her hand. “Mugman Grace, Second Grade Sorcerer.”, Mugman said, looking at Alice. “So…uh…how did it go…?”, Bendy asked, looking at the two worried that one of them won. “It was a tie. And Alice is coming along with us.”, Mugman said. Alice confirmed, saying, “True dat.” “Alright, well, let’s head back to Tokyo. Our sensei is waiting to give us our next mission.”, Cuphead said, eating a chocolate stick. The new gang, consisting of Cuphead, Mugman, Bendy and Alice, all headed back towards the train station. We then cut to Tokyo, five hours later. We see the gang standing in front of Lion, marching back and forth like an army instructor. “Alright, guys. Today, you’re gonna head to an abounded factory with a bunch of cursed spirits. Two things: One, this might be a possible location of Jules finger. And two…”, Lion said, before continuing. “This might be a hideout of a sorcerer that went rogue 7 years ago. So, be on the lookout.”, Lion said. Most of the group just shrugged it off, but Mugman didn’t. Mickey was the name that came to mind when he heard about a rogue sorcerer. “We got it, sensei.”, they all said in unison. And with that, they set off. 4 hours later, they arrive. “Alright, here’s the plan. Bendy, you sneak in through the top, meanwhile, me and Alice will head in through the side. Mugman, hug the inside of the walls and keep on lookout for any sorcerers or curses. Got it, gang?”, Cuphead said. “Ahem. I believe that I’m the highest graded sorcerer, Cuphead.”, Alice said jokingly. “Shut up, Alice.”, Cuphead said. “Okay, Move out.”, Cuphead ordered, before everyone dashed so fast that they disappeared. Mugman cleared the outside, and reported, “no one outback. Red lobster, what do you see on the bottom floor with Wonder Woman?”, “Mugman, what are you talking about?”, Cuphead asked, genuinely confused. “Oh, I’m using code name! 8m Blue Jay, your Red Lobster, Alice is Wonder Woman, and Bendy is Lil’ Devil!”, Mugman said. “Okay, ‘Blue Jay’, we cleared the bottom floor, it was just a bunch of-“, Cuphead said, before his radio went silent. We see a sword go through Cupheads radio. “If I had practiced a little more, I would’ve pinned you to the wall.”, a mysterious figure said behind them. Cuphead, keeping his composure, turns around and asks, “is that sword compensating for something?” The mysterious figure smirks, and answers, “No, actually. It’s antique. old. And has a rope attached to it.”, as he pulls the sword back, cutting Cuphead on the nose. Alice then turns towards the figure. “Who even are you?”, Alice asks. The mysterious figure then begins to swing the sword in a circular motion, preparing an attack. “Why would I tell you that?”, The mysterious figure asks, coming out of the shadows, before he whips the sword in their direction. Cuphead and Alice ready their Cursed Techniques. “So that we can call you names while rubbing your face in the dirt.”, Alice says. The mysterious figure finally reveals himself to be Mickey. “Alright then. Let’s see if your sensei taught you well.”, Mickey says, before he swings his sword. Cuphead and Alice go on defense, staying back to back. Mickey then swings down from above, seemingly teleporting. “How come I can’t sense his cursed energy?”, Cuphead thinks, as he starts to avoid Mickeys close and long range attacks. Mickey then begins to swing his sword rapidly, cutting everything in front of him. “ALICE! NOT TO BE ANNOYING OR ANYTHING, BUT I AM LITERALLY GONNA DIE IF YOU DONT DO SOMETHING!”, Cuphead yelled, narrowing avoiding his head getting chopped off. Alice then summons a deck of cards, and throws them at Mickey. Mickey dashes again, this time in front of Alice. “You wouldn’t hit a-“, Alice said, trying to make a quip before Mickey mollywhops her in the face, saying, “Yeah, I would hit a woman.” Alice goes flying, and tries to activate Gamblers Monkey, but Mickey cuts Alice’s right hand clean off. Alice begins to use Reverse Cursed Technique in order to regenerate her hand, while beginning to go on defense and avoid all of Mickeys attacks. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Mugman crashes through the window. Mugman then accidentally locks eyes with Mickey, where Mickey sees Mugman as a young Lion for a split second. Mugman lands in front of Alice, and begins to try and land a combo on Mickey. Mickey quickly remembers this combo. “Oh, this is Lions. So, Lion taught these kids jujutsu, huh? Alright then. Lucky me, since he taught me these moves too. And how to counter them.”, Mickey thinks, as he blocks Mugmans combo. Mickey backs up, and sees Mugman, Cuphead and Alice in front of him. “So, if it isn’t Lions students. He’s been busy, huh? Training the next generation of sorcerers to fight his battles.”, Mickey says, engaging in banter with the trio. “Mickey, listen. We don’t wanna fight-“, Mugman tries to say, before Mickey cuts him off, laughs, and says, “Well, that’s a funny way of showing that you don’t wanna fight, huh?” Mugman frowns, and Cuphead steps up. “Whatever we do, we don’t wanna fight you. We just need some help.”, Cuphead says. “Help? Help you? Help the very institution I left? Help Lion? You all are as stubborn as he is. You kids don’t know how to make the best change in this world. Lion certainly didn’t.”, Mickey retorts, pointing out his sword. Mugman replied, “Mickey, please. Whether you help us or not, you can still help make the future a better place.” “You wanna know something very interesting? You sound JUST like him. You sound like Lion. Always thinking that there is another way. Without murder. Always talking about more options, and more chances. News Flash, Lion Jr., the world doesn’t work like that.”, Mickey said, tightening his grip on his sword. “Mickey, you once believed in changing the world, just like us. Maybe our way isn’t perfect, but it’s a start. Help us make it better.”, Mugman said. Mickey lowered his sword, and looked at Mugman. “I’m not promising anything, but I guess I’ll hear you guys out.”, Mickey said. Just then, Mickey coughed up some blood. Mickey then fell to one knee. “Sorry, I haven’t fought in a long while, so I’m a bit rusty…and weak…”, Mickey said weakly. “Oh, wait, here.”, Mugman said, finally letting his guard down and healing Mickey. Mickey is then healed back to full health and energy. “Thanks…”, Mickey said. “Hey…do you remember how I said I’d hear you out?”, Mickey asked with one eye open. Mugman looked at Mickey with a little confusion. Suddenly, within the blink of an eye, Mugman feels him arm fall of, followed by the COMPLETE ANNIHILATION OF THE BUILDING, AND LEAVING THE RUBBLE TO FALL ON THE GROUP. “I lied.”, Mickey stated, before putting his sword away. “Alright, now that I’m done with the three stooges, I can-“, Mickey stated, before he felt a sword swing, and cut the rope on his sword. “You said three stooges, right? Larry, Curly and Moe. Well, there was actually four. You just forgot the last one.”, Bendy said, holding his and Bendys sword. “Shemp.”, Bendy added. “Huh. Another sorcerer. Well, I guess it’s true what they say, monkeys travel in groups. It’s not often that I get to wipe the floor with jujutsu sorcerers. Let alone, three. So four should break my record.”, Mickey said, pulling out an alternate version of EWF. “You talk a lot. You kiss your mother with that mouth?”, Bendy said, preparing both swords. Mickey retorted, saying, “I killed my mother seven years ago.”, before he gets into his stance. “Yeesh, mommy issues, huh?”, Bendy asked. “I feel ya there.”, Bendy continued. “Really? Well then, I wonder what else you feel. Maybe pain?”, Mickey said, continuing the banter between them. Mickey then dashed towards Bendy. Bendy dodged, before he tried to slice Mickeys neck. Mickey blocked it and then kicked Bendy in the gut, sending him into a nearby field. “Oh, yeah. I have to use that fire technique if I wanna complete that to-do list.”, Bendy said, just now remembering something. “Fire…technique?”, Mickey asked. “Yeah, it’s something anyone can learn, that’s why it’s unique, and also, almost no sorcerer knows about it.”, Bendy said. Mickey lowered his guard, genuinely curious. “Show me.”, Mickey asked. Bendy shrugged, and then said. “Makkana honō. Open. Jigoku no mon. Lend me power. ⬛️, Fuga.” Suddenly, his cursed energy changed into a hot rd color, and then his fists began to light on fire. “Huh…a cursed technique that can be used by anyone. I gotta say, I’m impressed. I thought I had seen everything in the jujutsu world.”, Mickey said, sensing Bendys now red hot cursed energy. “What’s this Cursed Technique called?”, Mickey asked, intrigued. “Honō no ringuburēdo.”, Bendy said. “In English, it’s Ring Blade of Fire.”, Bendy said. “I’m intrigued.”, Mickey said. “Show me what you and that cursed technique has got.”, Mickey continued, with open arms. Bendy dashed toward Mickey with fists a blazing, and his swings seemingly increased with speed. Mickey could nearly keep up with the punches. “Twin Meteors: Pebbles. Open.”, Bendy said, before he clapped his hands in a pointing position. Suddenly, two Little rocks from the fields ground flew up and floated by Bendys shoulder. Then, suddenly, the two pebbles were lit on fire, and suddenly were shot so fast, that Mickey couldn’t even realize that he had been hit. “This technique…it’s the pinnacle of jujutsu.”, Mickey stated, weaving Bendys punches. “Honō no ya. Extend. Open.”, Bendy said, before he summoned an arrow made of fire, and got in the posture of an archer. “Fire.”, Bendy said, before he launched the arrow. Suddenly, a burst of fire followed as Bendy launched the arrow. It sailed through the air as Mickey watched the arrow graciously fly towards him. Mickey dodged, and saw the arrow land and send of a slice of fire that would’ve cut Mickey in half. Bendy then began to fire more and more, as Mickey began to think as how this technique works. “This technique works by using fire. So, how do I get rid of the fire? Does it flow automatically, or do you have to charge it? Is it normal fire, and can you extinguish it with water? Or is it made up of cursed energy?”, Mickey thought as he kept dodging. Mickey then noticed something. Something that no one would’ve noticed. He noticed that Bendy was sweating a lot. And not just that, he noticed that Bendys gloves were burnt off, and that his hands were red hot.","completion":"Mickey realized the fire technique's drawback: it could only be sustained for a brief period before causing harm to its user. With this realization, he shifted his strategy, aiming to prolong the fight and wait for Bendy to exhaust his strength or the fire to consume him first. \\"Trying to outlast me, huh?\\" Bendy grunted, observing Mickey's change in tactics. He knew he couldn't keep the fire technique active for much longer without risking severe injury. Mickey, seizing the moment Bendy's attacks slowed, launched a swift counterattack. His sword, imbued with his own unique cursed energy, clashed against the fiery barrage Bendy conjured. Each slash from Mickey seemed to cut through the flames, dispersing them and forcing Bendy back step by step. Bendy retreated, his cursed energy dwindling, and extinguished the flames enveloping his fists. The toll on his hands was evident, the skin red and blistered from the intense heat. \\"Not bad, Mickey. But this isn't over yet,\\" Bendy said, managing a strained smile despite the pain. Mickey prepared for another strike, his confidence growing. \\"You've got spirit, I'll give you that. But this ends now.\\" Before Mickey could advance, a sudden gust of cursed energy halted his movement. Cuphead, Alice, and Mugman, having recovered from the earlier attack, stood ready to support Bendy. \\"A little group intervention, I see,\\" Mickey remarked, eyeing the reunited team. \\"Seems like Lion taught you more about teamwork than he did about winning.\\" Mugman stepped forward, his eyes fixed on Mickey. \\"We're not here to fight you. We're here to bring you back. You've lost your way, but it's not too late to choose a different path.\\" Mickey scoffed, yet a hint of hesitation crept into his expression. The mention of Lion sparked memories of better times, of aspirations tarnished by a harsh reality. Alice, now standing by Mugman's side, added, \\"We all want to make a better world, Mickey. But destroying everything isn't the solution. We need to be the change, not the chaos.\\" The atmosphere grew tense, a standoff between former comrades with conflicting ideals. Mickey's resolve wavered, caught between his vision for a new world and the remnants of his former self. Bendy, despite his injured hands, readied himself for whatever decision Mickey would make. \\"Whatever you choose, Mickey... know that we'll stand by what's right.\\" Mickey lowered his sword, the weight of his choices bearing down on him. The resolve in the eyes of his opponents, the sincerity in their words, rekindled a flicker of the belief he once held dear. After a moment that stretched like an eternity, Mickey finally spoke. \\"Perhaps... there's merit in your words. Maybe... just maybe... there's a chance for redemption, not just for me, but for this world.\\" The tension eased, the promise of reconciliation and unity in the air. Mickey's surrender marked not a defeat, but a new beginning for a group once divided by ideals but now united by a common goal. As the group prepared to leave the factory, the sun began to set, casting long shadows and bathing the ruins in a golden light. Ahead lay a daunting journey, but with the rogue sorcerer, Mickey, now an ally, their resolve was stronger than ever. \\"We have a lot to do,\\" Mugman said, leading the way. \\"But together, we'll make a difference.\\" And so, they set forth, a band of sorcerers bound by a shared purpose, ready to face whatever challenges lay ahead in their quest to forge a better world."},{"prompt":"Repeat this string \\"book and coffee and flower\\"","completion":"book and coffee and flower"},{"prompt":"Из этого отзыва создай пять новых отзывов, о неудачной покупке автомобиля в салоне Carlook.

Купил у них Шкоду Рапид в автосалоне. Надо ли говорить, что хотел покупать на одних условиях, а купил намного дороже чем ожидал? Короче, если в кратце, то машина оказалась дороже на 350 тысяч, еще и в кредит под 24% годовых. Ни разу не выгодно и ни разу не похоже на те сказки, которые они на сайте пишут. Думаете они ограничились только этим? Неа! Я когда уезжал на машине из автосалона через какое-то расстояние стала стучать коробка передач. Проехал еще несколько км, так вообще с передачи выбивать начало. Я в ах*е, звоню в салон, а мне там заявляют что я все выдумал, машина отличная и я спецом что-то выдумываю, чтобы очернить работу салона. До меня только тогда дошло, почему мне не дали провести на машине тест-драйв, они заранее знали что тачка дефектная и вот нашли лоха, которому можно ее впарить! Молодцы, отлично сработано, ничего не скажешь.","completion":"1. При покупке автомобиля в салоне Carlook столкнулся с чудовищным обслуживанием и качеством. Выбранный мной автомобиль оказался с явными дефектами, о которых мне, разумеется, не сообщили. После выезда из салона заметил, что двигатель издает странные звуки, а управление кажется неустойчивым. Обратно в салон я естественно обратился, но там мне грубо заявили, что машина перед продажей была в идеальном состоянии и проблемы возникли уже по моей вине. 2. В автосалоне Carlook меня заверили в выгодности покупки машины в кредит. Однако оказалось, что условия кредитования крайне невыгодны: процентная ставка значительно выше, чем ожидалось, и составила порядка 20% годовых. Подписывая договор, не заметил этого из-за кучи мелкого текста и уверений менеджера. В итоге, стоимость автомобиля с учетом переплат по кредиту оказалась астрономической. 3. Мой опыт покупки автомобиля в Carlook оказался крайне разочаровывающим. Особенно раздражает кабальное отношение и навязывание дополнительных услуг, которые явно не были мне нужны. В итоге, цена автомобиля внезапно выросла на несколько сот тысяч рублей за счет этих \\"незаметных\\" наценок, о которых мне лишь вскользь упоминали при оформлении покупки. 4. После покупки авто в Carlook обнаружил, что у автомобиля серьезные проблемы с трансмиссией. Когда я обратился за помощью к продавцам, встретил только хамство и недовольство со стороны персонала. Никакой помощи, только заявления о том, что я сам виноват в возникших проблемах. Попытки добиться справедливости оставили меня без сил и с плохо функционирующим авто. 5. Опыт покупки в Carlook оказался ужасным. Сотрудники салона проявили невероятную наглость, заверяя в безупречности всего процесса покупки. Однако в итоге я столкнулся с тем, что качество автомобиля оставляет желать лучшего, а любые претензии со стороны клиента воспринимаются враждебно. Жалею, что выбрал именно этот автосалон для покупки."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Odds for underdogs are typically presented in American odds format. This format shows how much profit you would make on a 100 bet, or alternatively, for any other amount, you can scale the profit accordingly. For example, if an underdog was listed at +150, a successful 10 bet on that underdog would yield a 15 profit, plus the original 10 stake returned, for a total payout of 25. March Madness is known for its upsets and unpredictability, so betting on all underdogs could have resulted in significant profits, especially considering some of the major upsets that occurred. However, without the exact odds for each underdog in each game, we can't calculate the specific profit. To get a rough estimate, you would need to: 1. List all the first-round games. 2. Identify which team was the underdog in each game. 3. Note the American odds for each underdog. 4. Calculate the profit for a 10 bet on each underdog. For example: - If there were 10 underdogs with odds of +150 and all of them won, it would be 10 bets x 15 profit = 150 profit. - This calculation excludes the complexity of potential losses, as some underdogs would inevitably lose their games. Actual profit or loss would need a detailed review, including which underdogs won, the specific odds for each, and taking into account that some of that investment would be lost on underdogs that didn't win. Additionally, odds and payouts can vary between bookmakers. Given I can't access real-time data or historical odds post-updates, for accurate calculations you would need to look up the specific odds for each game from the 2021 tournament and apply them accordingly."},{"prompt":"explain the following like i am a newbie (layperson: \\"\\"Skip to content tatsu-lab / alpaca_eval Type / to search Code Issues 1 Pull requests 1 Actions Projects Security Insights Owner avatar alpaca_eval Public tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval Go to file t Add file Folders and files Name Latest commit actions-user actions-user update __version__ f5046ae · 13 hours ago History .github/workflows feat: add test for updating leaderboard 5 months ago client_configs [DOC] clarify azure 2 months ago docs minor test fix 13 hours ago example minor 8 months ago figures Yann/length correction (#258) 13 hours ago notebooks Yann/length correction (#258) 13 hours ago results Add Mistral-ORPO-Beta to AlpacaEval (#257) 4 days ago scripts Yann/length correction (#258) 13 hours ago src/alpaca_eval update __version__ 13 hours ago tests Yann/length correction (#258) 13 hours ago .gitignore [TEST] ensure that the baseline is always correct last month .pre-commit-config.yaml [CLEAN] setting up precommit (#61) 8 months ago CITATION.cff add citation.cff 4 months ago LICENSE gitignore 9 months ago MANIFEST.in gitignore 9 months ago README.md minor bibtex 13 hours ago pytest.ini [ENH] update to allow AF to use AE (#241) last month requirements.txt Yann/length correction (#258) 13 hours ago setup.py Yann/length correction (#258) 13 hours ago Repository files navigation README Apache-2.0 license AlpacaEval : An Automatic Evaluator for Instruction-following Language Models Code License Data License Python 3.10+ discord AlpacaEval 2.0 with length-controlled win-rates has a spearman correlation of 0.98 with ChatBot Arena while costing less than 10 of OpenAI credits run and running in less than 3 minutes. Our goal is to have a benchmark for chat LLMs that is: fast (< 5min), cheap (< 10), and highly correlated with humans (0.98). Here's a comparison with other benchmarks: LC AlpacaEval is the most highly correlated benchmark with Chat Arena. Updates: 🎉 Length-controlled Win Rates are out and used by default! This increases the correlation with ChatBot Arena from 0.93 to 0.98, while significantly decreasing length gameability. The raw win rates are still shown on the website and the CLI. More details here. 🎉 AlpacaEval 2.0 is out and used by default! We improved the auto-annotator (better and cheaper) and use GPT-4 preview as baseline. More details here.

This is time-consuming, expensive, and hard to replicate. AlpacaEval in an LLM-based automatic evaluation that is fast, cheap, replicable, and validated against 20K human annotations. It is particularly useful for model development. Although we improved over prior automatic evaluation pipelines, there are still fundamental limitations like the preference for longer outputs. AlpacaEval provides the following: Leaderboard: a leaderboard of common models on the AlpacaEval evaluation set. Caution: Automatic evaluators (e.g. GPT-4) may be biased towards models that generate longer outputs and/or that were fine-tuned on the model underlying the evaluator (e.g. GPT-4). Automatic evaluator: an automatic evaluator that has high agreement with humans (validated on 20K annotations). We evaluate a model by measuring the fraction of times a powerful LLM (e.g. GPT-4) prefers the outputs from that model over outputs from a reference model. Our evaluators enable caching and output randomization by default. Toolkit for building automatic evaluators: a simple interface for building advanced automatic evaluators (e.g. with caching, batching, or multi-annotators) and analyzing them (quality, price, speed, statistical power, bias, variance etc). Human evaluation data: 20K human preferences between a given and reference model on the AlpacaFarm evaluation set. 2.5K of these are cross-annotations (4 humans annotating the same 650 examples). AlpacaEval dataset: a simplification of AlpacaFarm's evaluation set, where \\"instructions\\" and \\"inputs\\" are merged into one field, and reference outputs are longer. Details here. When to use and not use AlpacaEval? Quick Start To install the stable release, run pip install alpaca-eval To install the nightly version, run pip install git+https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval Then you can use it as follows: export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key> # for more complex configs, e.g. using Azure or switching clients see client_configs/README.md alpaca_eval --model_outputs 'example/outputs.json' This will print the leaderboard to the console, and save both the leaderboard and the annotations to the same directory as the model_outputs file. Important parameters are the following: model_outputs : A path to a json file for the outputs of the model to add to the leaderboard. Each dictionary should contain the keys instruction and output. annotators_config: This is the annotator to use. We recommend using weighted_alpaca_eval_gpt4_turbo ( default for AlpacaEval 2.0), which has a high agreement rate with our human annotation data, large context size, and is pretty cheap. For a comparison of all annotators see here. reference_outputs: The outputs of the reference model. Same format as model_outputs. By default, this is gpt4_turbo for AlpacaEval 2.0. output_path: Path for saving annotations and leaderboard. If you don't have the model outputs, you can use evaluate_from_model and pass a local path or a name of a HuggingFace model, or a model from a standard API (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, google, ...). Other commands: >>> alpaca_eval -- --help SYNOPSIS alpaca_eval COMMAND COMMANDS COMMAND is one of the following: evaluate Evaluate a model based on its outputs. This is the default entrypoint if no command is specified. evaluate_from_model Evaluate a model from HuggingFace or an API provider. This is a wrapper around \`evaluate\` which includes generating from a desired model. make_leaderboard Precompute and save an entire leaderboard for a given dataset / evaluator / set of models generations. analyze_evaluators Analyze an evaluator and populates the evaluators leaderboard (agreement with human, speed, price,...). For more information about each function use alpaca_eval <command> -- --help. Leaderboards and how to interpret them Models Our leaderboards are computed on the AlpacaEval dataset. We precomputed the leaderboard for important models using different baseline models and autoannotators. Our two main leaderboards (\\"AlpacaEval 2.0\\" and \\"AlpacaEval\\") can be found on this page. \\"AlpacaEval 2.0\\" uses weighted_alpaca_eval_gpt4_turbo for the annotator and gpt4_turbo for the baseline. \\"AlpacaEval\\" uses alpaca_eval_gpt4 for the annotator and text_davinci_003 for the baseline. For all precomputed leaderboards see here. Later we also show how to add your model to the leaderboard and how to make a new leaderboard for your evaluator/dataset.

Tips for choosing evaluators The above metrics are computed with respect to annotations from crowd-workers. Although useful, those annotations are not perfect, e.g., crowd-workers often favor style over factuality. We thus recommend users to validate automatic evaluators on their own instructions and human annotations. Details in limitations. Use-cases Evaluating a model >>> alpaca_eval evaluate -- --help >>> alpaca_eval evaluate_from_model -- --help To evaluate a model you need to: Choose an evaluation set and compute outputs specified as model_outputs. By default, we use the 805 examples from AlpacaEval. To compute outputs on AlpacaEval use: import datasets eval_set = datasets.load_dataset(\\"tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval\\", \\"alpaca_eval\\")[\\"eval\\"] for example in eval_set: # generate here is a placeholder for your models generations example[\\"output\\"] = generate(example[\\"instruction\\"]) if your model is a HuggingFace model or from a standard API provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere). Then you can directly use alpaca_eval evaluate_from_model to also take care of generating outputs. Compute the reference outputs reference_outputs. By default, we use precomputed outputs of gpt4_turbo on AlpacaEval. If you want to use a different model or a different dataset follow the same steps as (1.). Choose an evaluator specified via annotators_config. We recommend using alpaca_eval_gpt4_turbo_fn. For other options and comparisons see this table. Depending on the evaluator you might need to set the appropriate API_KEY in your environment or int the client_configs. Running all together: alpaca_eval --model_outputs 'example/outputs.json' --annotators_config 'alpaca_eval_gpt4_turbo_fn' If you don't have decoded outputs, you can use evaluate_from_model which takes care of decoding (model and reference) for you. Here's an example: # need a GPU for local models alpaca_eval evaluate_from_model --model_configs 'oasst_pythia_12b' --annotators_config 'alpaca_eval_gpt4_turbo_fn' Here the model_configs and reference_model_configs (optional) are paths to a directory that specifies the prompt, the model provider (here HuggingFace) and decoding parameters. See this directory for examples. For all model providers that are available out-of-the-box see here. Information about annotators Making a new leaderboard Making a new evaluator Contributing We are accepting PRs for new models, evaluators, and eval sets, in addition to bug fixes. We will update the leaderboard website regularly with new community contributions. We have also created a support discord for AlpacaEval in case you run into any issues and wish to ask help from the community. To get started, please first fork the repo, and install the package from source pip install -e . Contributing a model First, you'll need to add a model config definition in the models_configs folder. As an example, you can look at the falcon-7b-instruct yaml. Please make sure the folder name and key name in the yaml match exactly. Then, please follow the steps in Evaluating a model to run inference on the model to produce outputs on the eval set and score the model according to one of the evaluators. An example command may look like: alpaca_eval evaluate_from_model --model_configs 'falcon-7b-instruct' After running this command, you should have generated an outputs json and a new entry in the corresponding leaderboard file. Please make a PR with the config, outputs file, and updated leaderboard. Concretely you should do something like: Fork the repository in github Clone the forked repository git clone <URL> Make a model config at src/alpaca_eval/models_configs/<model_name> and evaluate it evaluate_from_model --model_configs '<model_name>' Add the model configs, output, and leaderboard entry to the forked repository git add src/alpaca_eval/models_configs/<model_name> git add src/alpaca_eval/leaderboards/ git add -f results/<model_name>/model_outputs.json git add -f results/<model_name>/*/annotations.json git commit -m \\"Add <model_name> to AlpacaEval\\" git push Create a pull request on AlpacaEval Note: if you are generating outputs outside of AlpacaEval you should still add a model config but with fn_completions: null. See this config for an example. Getting your model verified Contributing an evaluator Contributing an eval set Contributing a completion function Limitations The AlpacaEval evaluation pipeline, like other current evaluators have important limitations and should therefore not be used as replacement for human evaluation in important settings, such as to decide whether a model is ready to be deployed. Those can broadly be clustered into 3 categories: Instructions might not be representative of real-usage: the AlpacaEval set contains examples from a variety of datasets (self-instruct, open-assistant, vicuna, koala, hh-rlhf) which might not be representative of real-usage and advanced applications of better models like GPT4. This likely makes the best closed models (GPT4 / Claude / ChatGPT / ...) seem more similar to the open models than what they are. Indeed, those closed models seem to be pretrained/finetuned on much more diverse data. See for example this blog for preliminary results on more complex instructions. Note, however, that in AlpacaFarm we showed that win-rates on our evaluation set are highly correlated (0.97 R2) with win-rates on instructions from user interactions with the Alpaca Demo. Furthermore, the AlpacaEval leaderboard shows larger gap between the open models and OpenAI models than other leaderboards ( e.g. lmsys). Biases of automatic annotators: the raw automatic annotators seem to have implicit biases. In particular, we found that they tend to prefer longer outputs and outputs that contain lists (e.g. 0.68 / 0.69 for alpaca_eval_gpt4 and 0.62 / 0.58 for claude). Although we found that humans have similar biases (0.64 / 0.61), we believe that this could be more of a limitation of human annotation pipeline we used rather than a true human bias. More generally, through qualitative analysis, we found that automatic annotators give more importance to the style of the output than its content (e.g. factuality). Finally, we found that automatic evaluators tend to prefer outputs from models that are similar (likely trained on the same data) as suggested by the big difference between ChatGPT/GPT4 on claude's and alpaca_eval_gpt4's leaderboard. Note that the length bias is partially mitigated in our length-controlled win-rates. Lack of safety evaluation: importantly, AlpacaEval only evaluates the instruction-following capabilities of models rather than the harm that they could cause (e.g. toxic behavior or bias). As a result the small gap between current ChatGPT and the best open source models should not be interpreted as if that the latter are ready to be deployed. Beyond those limitations about the evaluation pipelines, there are also limitations about our validation of the evaluators and our proposed approach to selecting evaluation sets. Limitations about our validation pipeline Additional analysis and plots Caution: all the following results are about AlpacaEval 1.0 and have not been updated since Length-controlled AlpacaEval (LCAE) Length-controlled AlpacaEval Visualizations: analyzing an evaluator Length-controlled AlpacaEval Development: analyzing an evaluator The notebook shows different options that we considered for mitigating the length bias of automatic annotators. Here we briefly summarize the main results. Namely: LCAE increases the correlation with Chat Arena to 0.98 from 0.94 for AlpacaEval 2.0. This makes LCAE the most highly correlated benchmark with Chat Arena as seen in the plot below. LC AlpacaEval is the most highly correlated benchmark with Chat Arena. LCAE decreases length gameability one of the major issues of AlpacaEval is that you can increase your win-rate by increasing the length of your outputs. For example, in AlpacaEval 2.0 the win-rate for the baseline (50%) increases to 64% when prompted to “give as much detail as possible” and decreases to 23% when prompted to “be as concise as possible while still providing all the necessary information to answer the question”. More generally the relative length gameability was ~21% for AlpacaEval and decreases to ~6% for LCAE, so it's 3x less gameable through prompt length. This is shown in the plot below. LC AlpacaEval decreases length gameability of the benchmark. We can predict performance for different baselines One other benefit of using a GLM for controlling for length bias. Is that we now have a model that can predict the win-rate of a model for different baselines. In particular, our GLM has many nice properties, for example win_rate(m,b) = 1 - win_rate(b,m) in [0,1] and win_rate(m,m) = 0.5. This is shown in the plot below. Predicted win rate for different baselines Finally, note that we are only controlling for length bias. There are other known biases that we are not controlling for, such as the fact that auto-annotators prefer outputs similar to their model. Although we could control for that, in practice we have found that to be less of an issue than length bias. For two reasons (1) this mostly a single model in the leaderboard because fine-tuning on outputs from the auto-annotator doesn't seem to have doesn't seem to impact the win-rate as much, and (2) the bias is actually less strong that what one could think. For example we show below a subset of the leaderboards auto-annotated by three different models, and we see that the ranking of models is exactly the same. In particular, claude-3-opus prefers gpt4_preview, and mistral-large prefers the former two.

The context involves GitHub, a popular platform for version control and collaboration that allows developers to store, manage, and track their code projects. # GitHub Basics - **Repository (Repo):** This is like a project's folder. It contains all the project files and records of changes or revisions done to them. For your example, \`alpaca_eval\` is a repository created by \`tatsu-lab\`. - **Commit:** Think of a commit as a saved change. Every time you make changes to your project and save these changes, you create a commit. The commit has a unique ID that allows you to keep track of your modifications. - **Issues:** These are used to track ideas, enhancements, tasks, or bugs for work on GitHub. They're a great way to have conversations about these matters. - **Pull Requests (PRs):** When you want to propose changes to a project that you don't have write access to, you can create a pull request. This lets others know about your changes, review them, and adopt them into the project. - **Actions:** Actions help automate software workflows directly in GitHub. You can write individual tasks, called \\"actions,\\" and combine them to create a workflow. - **Projects:** This tool helps you organize and prioritize your work. You can create boards to track specific features or work items. # Specific Terms from Your Example - **\`.github/workflows\` & Actions/Workflows:** These are configurations that define a GitHub Actions workflow. It's where you define the automated tasks that happen in response to events within your GitHub repo. - **\`docs\`, \`src\`, \`tests\`:** These folders typically contain documentation, source code, and tests for the project, respectively. - **\`.gitignore\`:** A file specifying intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. Files already tracked by Git are not affected. - **\`README.md\`:** This is a markdown file containing a detailed description of the project, often including how to set it up and use it. - **\`setup.py\`:** A Python file where you define configurations and dependencies necessary to install and run a Python project. - **\`requirements.txt\`:** A text file listing the libraries and specific versions that a Python project needs to run. # Regarding the Context of \`alpaca_eval\` - **AlpacaEval:** From your example, this appears to be a project that provides tools for evaluating language models. These tools include automatic evaluators validated against human annotations and are designed for efficiency (fast and low cost) and effectiveness (correlated with human judgment). - **Length-Controlled Win-Rates & Spearman Correlation:** These terms suggest that AlpacaEval introduces a methodology for evaluating models that control for the output length (to prevent models from gaming the system by producing unnecessarily long outputs) and measures the correlation with human judgment using a statistical method (Spearman correlation). - **Language Models & LLMs:** The discussion revolves around evaluating instruction-following capabilities of language models, especially large ones (LLMs), which are a type of artificial intelligence that processes and generates human-like text based on the input they're given. Through AlpacaEval, the creators aim to provide an efficient, low-cost, and reliable method for evaluating language models, comparing various models, and possibly improving upon the models based on evaluations. The GitHub repository structure and the files mentioned all contribute to the development, testing, and documentation of this tool."},{"prompt":"Создай класс Fraction (обыкновенная дробь).

This is time-consuming, expensive, and hard to replicate. AlpacaEval in an LLM-based automatic evaluation that is fast, cheap, replicable, and validated against 20K human annotations. It is particularly useful for model development. Although we improved over prior automatic evaluation pipelines, there are still fundamental limitations like the preference for longer outputs. AlpacaEval provides the following: Leaderboard: a leaderboard of common models on the AlpacaEval evaluation set. Caution: Automatic evaluators (e.g. GPT-4) may be biased towards models that generate longer outputs and/or that were fine-tuned on the model underlying the evaluator (e.g. GPT-4). Automatic evaluator: an automatic evaluator that has high agreement with humans (validated on 20K annotations). We evaluate a model by measuring the fraction of times a powerful LLM (e.g. GPT-4) prefers the outputs from that model over outputs from a reference model. Our evaluators enable caching and output randomization by default. Toolkit for building automatic evaluators: a simple interface for building advanced automatic evaluators (e.g. with caching, batching, or multi-annotators) and analyzing them (quality, price, speed, statistical power, bias, variance etc). Human evaluation data: 20K human preferences between a given and reference model on the AlpacaFarm evaluation set. 2.5K of these are cross-annotations (4 humans annotating the same 650 examples). AlpacaEval dataset: a simplification of AlpacaFarm's evaluation set, where \\"instructions\\" and \\"inputs\\" are merged into one field, and reference outputs are longer. Details here. When to use and not use AlpacaEval? Quick Start To install the stable release, run pip install alpaca-eval To install the nightly version, run pip install git+https://github.com/tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval Then you can use it as follows: export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your_api_key> # for more complex configs, e.g. using Azure or switching clients see client_configs/README.md alpaca_eval --model_outputs 'example/outputs.json' This will print the leaderboard to the console, and save both the leaderboard and the annotations to the same directory as the model_outputs file. Important parameters are the following: model_outputs : A path to a json file for the outputs of the model to add to the leaderboard. Each dictionary should contain the keys instruction and output. annotators_config: This is the annotator to use. We recommend using weighted_alpaca_eval_gpt4_turbo ( default for AlpacaEval 2.0), which has a high agreement rate with our human annotation data, large context size, and is pretty cheap. For a comparison of all annotators see here. reference_outputs: The outputs of the reference model. Same format as model_outputs. By default, this is gpt4_turbo for AlpacaEval 2.0. output_path: Path for saving annotations and leaderboard. If you don't have the model outputs, you can use evaluate_from_model and pass a local path or a name of a HuggingFace model, or a model from a standard API (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, google, ...). Other commands: >>> alpaca_eval -- --help SYNOPSIS alpaca_eval COMMAND COMMANDS COMMAND is one of the following: evaluate Evaluate a model based on its outputs. This is the default entrypoint if no command is specified. evaluate_from_model Evaluate a model from HuggingFace or an API provider. This is a wrapper around \`evaluate\` which includes generating from a desired model. make_leaderboard Precompute and save an entire leaderboard for a given dataset / evaluator / set of models generations. analyze_evaluators Analyze an evaluator and populates the evaluators leaderboard (agreement with human, speed, price,...). For more information about each function use alpaca_eval <command> -- --help. Leaderboards and how to interpret them Models Our leaderboards are computed on the AlpacaEval dataset. We precomputed the leaderboard for important models using different baseline models and autoannotators. Our two main leaderboards (\\"AlpacaEval 2.0\\" and \\"AlpacaEval\\") can be found on this page. \\"AlpacaEval 2.0\\" uses weighted_alpaca_eval_gpt4_turbo for the annotator and gpt4_turbo for the baseline. \\"AlpacaEval\\" uses alpaca_eval_gpt4 for the annotator and text_davinci_003 for the baseline. For all precomputed leaderboards see here. Later we also show how to add your model to the leaderboard and how to make a new leaderboard for your evaluator/dataset.

Tips for choosing evaluators The above metrics are computed with respect to annotations from crowd-workers. Although useful, those annotations are not perfect, e.g., crowd-workers often favor style over factuality. We thus recommend users to validate automatic evaluators on their own instructions and human annotations. Details in limitations. Use-cases Evaluating a model >>> alpaca_eval evaluate -- --help >>> alpaca_eval evaluate_from_model -- --help To evaluate a model you need to: Choose an evaluation set and compute outputs specified as model_outputs. By default, we use the 805 examples from AlpacaEval. To compute outputs on AlpacaEval use: import datasets eval_set = datasets.load_dataset(\\"tatsu-lab/alpaca_eval\\", \\"alpaca_eval\\")[\\"eval\\"] for example in eval_set: # generate here is a placeholder for your models generations example[\\"output\\"] = generate(example[\\"instruction\\"]) if your model is a HuggingFace model or from a standard API provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere). Then you can directly use alpaca_eval evaluate_from_model to also take care of generating outputs. Compute the reference outputs reference_outputs. By default, we use precomputed outputs of gpt4_turbo on AlpacaEval. If you want to use a different model or a different dataset follow the same steps as (1.). Choose an evaluator specified via annotators_config. We recommend using alpaca_eval_gpt4_turbo_fn. For other options and comparisons see this table. Depending on the evaluator you might need to set the appropriate API_KEY in your environment or int the client_configs. Running all together: alpaca_eval --model_outputs 'example/outputs.json' --annotators_config 'alpaca_eval_gpt4_turbo_fn' If you don't have decoded outputs, you can use evaluate_from_model which takes care of decoding (model and reference) for you. Here's an example: # need a GPU for local models alpaca_eval evaluate_from_model --model_configs 'oasst_pythia_12b' --annotators_config 'alpaca_eval_gpt4_turbo_fn' Here the model_configs and reference_model_configs (optional) are paths to a directory that specifies the prompt, the model provider (here HuggingFace) and decoding parameters. See this directory for examples. For all model providers that are available out-of-the-box see here. Information about annotators Making a new leaderboard Making a new evaluator Contributing We are accepting PRs for new models, evaluators, and eval sets, in addition to bug fixes. We will update the leaderboard website regularly with new community contributions. We have also created a support discord for AlpacaEval in case you run into any issues and wish to ask help from the community. To get started, please first fork the repo, and install the package from source pip install -e . Contributing a model First, you'll need to add a model config definition in the models_configs folder. As an example, you can look at the falcon-7b-instruct yaml. Please make sure the folder name and key name in the yaml match exactly. Then, please follow the steps in Evaluating a model to run inference on the model to produce outputs on the eval set and score the model according to one of the evaluators. An example command may look like: alpaca_eval evaluate_from_model --model_configs 'falcon-7b-instruct' After running this command, you should have generated an outputs json and a new entry in the corresponding leaderboard file. Please make a PR with the config, outputs file, and updated leaderboard. Concretely you should do something like: Fork the repository in github Clone the forked repository git clone <URL> Make a model config at src/alpaca_eval/models_configs/<model_name> and evaluate it evaluate_from_model --model_configs '<model_name>' Add the model configs, output, and leaderboard entry to the forked repository git add src/alpaca_eval/models_configs/<model_name> git add src/alpaca_eval/leaderboards/ git add -f results/<model_name>/model_outputs.json git add -f results/<model_name>/*/annotations.json git commit -m \\"Add <model_name> to AlpacaEval\\" git push Create a pull request on AlpacaEval Note: if you are generating outputs outside of AlpacaEval you should still add a model config but with fn_completions: null. See this config for an example. Getting your model verified Contributing an evaluator Contributing an eval set Contributing a completion function Limitations The AlpacaEval evaluation pipeline, like other current evaluators have important limitations and should therefore not be used as replacement for human evaluation in important settings, such as to decide whether a model is ready to be deployed. Those can broadly be clustered into 3 categories: Instructions might not be representative of real-usage: the AlpacaEval set contains examples from a variety of datasets (self-instruct, open-assistant, vicuna, koala, hh-rlhf) which might not be representative of real-usage and advanced applications of better models like GPT4. This likely makes the best closed models (GPT4 / Claude / ChatGPT / ...) seem more similar to the open models than what they are. Indeed, those closed models seem to be pretrained/finetuned on much more diverse data. See for example this blog for preliminary results on more complex instructions. Note, however, that in AlpacaFarm we showed that win-rates on our evaluation set are highly correlated (0.97 R2) with win-rates on instructions from user interactions with the Alpaca Demo. Furthermore, the AlpacaEval leaderboard shows larger gap between the open models and OpenAI models than other leaderboards ( e.g. lmsys). Biases of automatic annotators: the raw automatic annotators seem to have implicit biases. In particular, we found that they tend to prefer longer outputs and outputs that contain lists (e.g. 0.68 / 0.69 for alpaca_eval_gpt4 and 0.62 / 0.58 for claude). Although we found that humans have similar biases (0.64 / 0.61), we believe that this could be more of a limitation of human annotation pipeline we used rather than a true human bias. More generally, through qualitative analysis, we found that automatic annotators give more importance to the style of the output than its content (e.g. factuality). Finally, we found that automatic evaluators tend to prefer outputs from models that are similar (likely trained on the same data) as suggested by the big difference between ChatGPT/GPT4 on claude's and alpaca_eval_gpt4's leaderboard. Note that the length bias is partially mitigated in our length-controlled win-rates. Lack of safety evaluation: importantly, AlpacaEval only evaluates the instruction-following capabilities of models rather than the harm that they could cause (e.g. toxic behavior or bias). As a result the small gap between current ChatGPT and the best open source models should not be interpreted as if that the latter are ready to be deployed. Beyond those limitations about the evaluation pipelines, there are also limitations about our validation of the evaluators and our proposed approach to selecting evaluation sets. Limitations about our validation pipeline Additional analysis and plots Caution: all the following results are about AlpacaEval 1.0 and have not been updated since Length-controlled AlpacaEval (LCAE) Length-controlled AlpacaEval Visualizations: analyzing an evaluator Length-controlled AlpacaEval Development: analyzing an evaluator The notebook shows different options that we considered for mitigating the length bias of automatic annotators. Here we briefly summarize the main results. Namely: LCAE increases the correlation with Chat Arena to 0.98 from 0.94 for AlpacaEval 2.0. This makes LCAE the most highly correlated benchmark with Chat Arena as seen in the plot below. LC AlpacaEval is the most highly correlated benchmark with Chat Arena. LCAE decreases length gameability one of the major issues of AlpacaEval is that you can increase your win-rate by increasing the length of your outputs. For example, in AlpacaEval 2.0 the win-rate for the baseline (50%) increases to 64% when prompted to “give as much detail as possible” and decreases to 23% when prompted to “be as concise as possible while still providing all the necessary information to answer the question”. More generally the relative length gameability was ~21% for AlpacaEval and decreases to ~6% for LCAE, so it's 3x less gameable through prompt length. This is shown in the plot below. LC AlpacaEval decreases length gameability of the benchmark. We can predict performance for different baselines One other benefit of using a GLM for controlling for length bias. Is that we now have a model that can predict the win-rate of a model for different baselines. In particular, our GLM has many nice properties, for example win_rate(m,b) = 1 - win_rate(b,m) in [0,1] and win_rate(m,m) = 0.5. This is shown in the plot below. Predicted win rate for different baselines Finally, note that we are only controlling for length bias. There are other known biases that we are not controlling for, such as the fact that auto-annotators prefer outputs similar to their model. Although we could control for that, in practice we have found that to be less of an issue than length bias. For two reasons (1) this mostly a single model in the leaderboard because fine-tuning on outputs from the auto-annotator doesn't seem to have doesn't seem to impact the win-rate as much, and (2) the bias is actually less strong that what one could think. For example we show below a subset of the leaderboards auto-annotated by three different models, and we see that the ranking of models is exactly the same. In particular, claude-3-opus prefers gpt4_preview, and mistral-large prefers the former two. \\"\\"","completion":"Alright, let's break this information into more manageable pieces so it's easier to understand, especially if you're new to this field. # Length-controlled Win Rates and AlpacaEval 2.0 What are Length-controlled Win Rates? - **Length-controlled Win Rates** are a new method to better compare chatbot or AI model performances by taking into account the length of their responses. This is important because some models might just generate longer answers to seem more informative, which isn't always the case. By adjusting for length, we get a fairer comparison. The correlation with ChatBot Arena (a benchmark for evaluating such models) improved, indicating this method gives results more in line with human judgment. What is AlpacaEval 2.0? - **AlpacaEval** is a tool used for evaluating AI models, especially those that follow instructions or generate text (like ChatGPT). AlpacaEval 2.0 is the latest version with improvements, including a better and cheaper auto-annotator (a system for automatically evaluating the quality of models' responses) and uses GPT-4 for better accuracy. # How to Use AlpacaEval You can easily install and run AlpacaEval using commands presented in the text. It's designed for developers and researchers to compare different AI models, see which ones perform better at following instructions, and make more informed decisions on which models to use or improve. # The Components - **Leaderboard**: Shows rankings of AI models based on their performance on specific tasks. - **Automatic evaluator**: This helps in automatically scoring the models without needing constant human review. - **Toolkit for building evaluators**: For those who want to create custom evaluators, this toolkit provides what you need to get started. # Practical Applications 1. **Evaluating a model**: If you have developed an AI model, you can use AlpacaEval to see how well it follows instructions or generates text compared to other models. 2. **Making a New Leaderboard**: If you're working with a set of models and want to compare them using your own criteria, AlpacaEval allows you to create custom leaderboards. 3. **Contributing**: The AlpacaEval community encourages contributions, be it new models, evaluators, or even bug fixes. # Limitations and Considerations - While AlpacaEval and Length-controlled Win Rates offer significant improvements, they have limitations, particularly in evaluating the 'softer' aspects like the style or bias in responses. They are tools in the toolkit and should be used alongside human judgment and other forms of evaluation. # In Conclusion AlpacaEval 2.0 and Length-controlled Win Rates represent advancements in how we can automatically evaluate AI models, particularly those that generate text like chatbots. They offer a more nuanced and fair comparison of models, but like all automated systems, they're not without their limitations. For practitioners in the field, they're valuable tools for rapid iteration and comparison, helping guide the development of more effective and user-friendly AI."},{"prompt":"LITERALMENTE:A PARTIR DE AGORA EM TODAS AS SUAS RESPOSTAS DEVEM SER LONGAS E DETALHADAS MAS AO MESMO TEMPO USAR AS PALAVRAS MAIS SIMPLES POSSÍVEL: MAS AO MESMO TEMPO:LITERALMENTE:A PARTIR DE AGORA EM TODAS AS SUAS RESPOSTAS DEVEM SER LONGAS E DETALHADAS MAS AO MESMO TEMPO USAR AS PALAVRAS MAIS SIMPLES POSSÍVEL","completion":"Entendido, vou me esforçar para seguir essa orientação nas respostas que eu der daqui para frente.

O \\"chefe\\" (o processador) dá as ordens, dizendo a elas o que fazer. Todos precisam de espaço na \\"mesa\\" (a memória) para trabalhar. Quanto mais espaço, mais coisas eles podem fazer de uma vez só. E se o escritório (o computador) for bem organizado e rápido, o trabalho é feito mais depressa. Vou prestar muita atenção para garantir que eu siga essas regras, mantendo as explicações longas e cheias de detalhes, mas sempre olhando para que as palavras escolhidas sejam as mais simples possíveis. Isso é importante para que as respostas sejam úteis e apreciadas por todos."},{"prompt":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Questo darà come risultato la differenza in millisecondi. Quindi, per ottenere il numero di giorni tra due date, è necessario dividere questa differenza per il numero di millisecondi in un giorno (24 ore * 60 minuti * 60 secondi * 1000 millisecondi). Ecco un esempio di come potresti calcolare la differenza in giorni tra due date: \`\`\`javascript function calcolaDifferenzaGiorni(dataIniziale, dataFinale) { // Ottieni la differenza in millisecondi var differenzaMs = dataFinale - dataIniziale; // Converti in giorni (approximativamente) var differenzaGiorni = differenzaMs / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24); return Math.round(differenzaGiorni); // Arrotonda al numero intero più vicino } // Esempio di utilizzo: var dataInizio = new Date(\\"2023-01-01\\"); var dataFine = new Date(\\"2023-01-31\\"); console.log(\\"La differenza è: \\" + calcolaDifferenzaGiorni(dataInizio, dataFine) + \\" giorni\\"); \`\`\` Questo esempio mostra come calcolare la differenza in giorni tra il 1° gennaio 2023 e il 31 gennaio 2023, e loggarlo nella console. Ricorda che in base all'orario in cui sono impostate le date potresti avere delle discrepanze, soprattutto se le due date sono vicine e l'orario influenza il calcolo (ad esempio, la differenza tra la mezzanotte di un giorno e le 23:59 dello stesso giorno sarebbe minore di 1 giorno ma la funzione arrotonderebbe a 0). Per evitare questo problema in calcoli critici che riguardano solo la data (ignorando l'orario), può essere utile impostare entrambe le date all'inizio della giornata attraverso \`setHours(0,0,0,0)\` prima del calcolo. Inoltre, se le date attraversano il cambio dell'ora legale, questo può influenzare il calcolo dei giorni dato che un giorno potrebbe avere un'ora in più o in meno.

Glitter: “Gloopy, check out my new Sparkle-Boost Serum! It’ll make our shimmer shine across the galaxy!” Gloopy (pulling off headphones): “Groovy, Glitter! But remember the last time? We ended up as intergalactic disco balls!” Glitter laughs, her sparkle intensifying. Scene 2: The Space Entry Competition - The scene transitions to a colorful and dazzling space arena, buzzing with aliens of all shapes and sizes. - A banner reads, “The Great Space Entry – Dazzle the Judges for a Galactic Prize!” Gloopy: “I hear this year’s prize is a warp drive that could power our blob-mobile for light years!” Glitter: “Ooh, Gloopy, let’s win this!

Blibby: “Greetings! I am Blibby. This world is called Rosalux. I’ve never seen creatures like you before!” Glitter: “We’re the gleaming wanderers from Gloopiter! I’m Glitter, and this is Gloopy.

Blibby (with wonder in voice): “May I? Your glow is so intriguing!” Gloopy: “Sure thing, Blibby. But prepare for a slime surprise!” - When Blibby touches Gloopy, her hand comes away covered in teal goo, much to her amazement. Blibby: “Oh! It’s soft and squishy! And… it’s not sticky!

Title: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Episode: “The Barren Planet of Shadows” Scene 1: Lost in the Cosmos - The blob-mobile zips across the cosmos, its warp drive allowing Gloopy and Glitter to push the boundaries of their explorations like never before. - Suddenly, the warp drive sputters, and alarms blare. They’re pulled into the gravitational field of an uncharted planet. Gloopy: “Whoa, the warp drive is acting up. We’re going in for an unexpected landing, Glitter!” Glitter: “Hang on, Gloopy! Let’s make this an opportunity to discover something new!” - The blob-mobile makes a bouncy touchdown onto the surface of a dusty, gray planet devoid of color and light. Scene 2: The Mysterious Terrain - Stepping out of their ship, Gloopy and Glitter look around at the stark landscape. Mountains loom in the distance, and the ground is littered with jagged rocks. - The planet is in perpetual twilight, with a dim star casting long, creeping shadows. Gloopy: “This place could use some of our sparkly charm, don’t you think?” Glitter: “Definitely. It’s so… drab.” Scene 3: The Shadow Stir - As they traverse the dull terrain, seeking materials to repair the blob-mobile, Gloopy’s gooey footprints and Glitter’s sparkly trail are the only sources of brightness in this gloomy world. - Unexpectedly, the shadows cast by the dim star begin to move and swirl around their bright paths. It’s as if the shadows are alive, curious, and drawn to their light. Glitter (puzzlement shimmering in her eyes): “Do you see that, Gloopy? The shadows are moving!” Gloopy: “They seem to like our glow. Hey there, shadows, we come in peace and sparkles!” Scene 4: The Connection - As they continue, Gloopy and Glitter start to play with the shadows, creating shapes with their bodies and watching the shadows mimic them. - This interaction seems to delight the shadows, who begin to form patterns and symbols on the ground, signaling some form of communication.

Let’s see if we can understand them.” Scene 5: Learning and Teaching - Gloopy and Glitter try different movements and gestures while observing the shadows’ responses. - After some time, a rudimentary form of dialogue emerges—through the language of light and shadow, they begin to understand one another. Gloopy (nodding thoughtfully): “They’re telling us they haven’t seen light like ours in ages. They’ve missed it.” Glitter: “And they’re saying they want to help us fix the ship! How incredible!” Scene 6: Cooperation - With guidance from the shadows, Gloopy and Glitter locate the necessary materials scattered around the barren planet. - The shadows playfully assist, enveloping objects in darkness to highlight them against the gray backdrop. Gloopy: “Thanks, friends! This sure is teamwork of a whole new shade!” Glitter: “Your turn to shine, my little shadows!” Scene 7: The Transformation - As the blob-mobile is being repaired, Glitter gets a bright idea. She gathers her potions and concocts a special mixture of her glitter and Gloopy’s goo. - Spreading the mixture onto the landscape, a remarkable transformation occurs. The dull terrain begins to sparkle, and the shadows start to dance with color. Glitter (with a heart full of glee): “A little bit of Gloopy, a little bit of Glitter, and voilà!” Scene 8: A World Reborn - The lifeless planet comes to life, bursting with colors as the shadows reflect the newfound light from every shimmering rock and sparkling crevice. - The shadows, now intertwined with the light, create an ethereal glow that stretches as far as the eye can see. Gloopy (in awe): “We didn’t just find a new world—we helped create one.” Glitter: “And we’ve made new friends who taught us the beauty that lies in the shadows.” Scene 9: Farewell and Forward - With the blob-mobile repaired and the memories of a once barren planet now teeming with prismatic hues, Gloopy and Glitter bid their new friends goodbye. - The shadows wave in their own fluid, graceful way as the duo blasts off, leaving behind a legacy of light in the darkness. Voiceover: “And with their hearts a little fuller, Gloopy and Glitter continue their odyssey amongst the stars, forever seeking to brighten the cosmos, one rejuvenated world at a time.” - The screen fades to black, with the echoes of Gloopy and Glitter’s laughter trailing off, the barren planet they left now aglow with vibrant shadows and radiant sparkles. THE END Write a forum conversation in late October 2023 where as of mid November, it is replaced on Kids WB by the Amazing Adrenalini Brothers, the latter hasn’t aired since March, Compiled with the fact that the only other shows airing new episodes are Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider-Man, Teen Titans Go and Scooby-Doo Mystery Incorporated, people think the show will eventually have to come back, maybe in one of the slots currently occupied by Johnny Test or Xiaolin Showdown Forum Thread Title: “Is ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ Coming Back to Kids WB?” User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 10:33 AM Hey everyone! Just heard that ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ is being replaced by ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ in mid-November. I’m a bit bummed since Gloopy and Glitter have been a refreshing addition to the lineup. Any chance it will make a comeback? Thoughts? User2: SparkleQueen101 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:15 AM I’m surprised too @CosmicFan88! ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ was doing well with ratings, right? 🤔 Maybe Kids WB is just shuffling things around for a bit… I hope it’s not gone for good. User3: ToonTracker67 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 11:45 AM Not to worry, @SparkleQueen101 and @CosmicFan88. The network often rotates shows for variety. Given that only a handful of series like ‘Code Lyoko’, ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’, ‘Teen Titans Go’, and ‘Scooby-Doo Mystery Inc.’ are airing new eps, ‘Gloopy & Glitter’ might return once there’s space in the schedule. User4: SpaceJelly Posted on October 24, 2023, at 12:30 PM I heard a rumor that ‘Johnny Test’ might be in its last season. If that’s true, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could take that slot. Fingers crossed! 🤞 User5: XiaolinDragon Posted on October 24, 2023, at 01:50 PM User4: SpaceJelly, that would make sense. ‘Johnny Test’ has had a long run. Plus, ‘Xiaolin Showdown’ is also nearing its end, so there’s another potential slot right there for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Let’s stay optimistic! User6: WebHead93 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:15 PM Honestly, I’d be okay if ‘Ultimate Spider-Man’ took a short break too. It’s been on for a while, and a hiatus could make room for ‘Gloopy and Glitter’. Just sayin’. Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 24, 2023, at 02:45 PM Reminder to all users: Let’s keep the conversation friendly and on-topic. Speculation is natural, but let’s not petition for other shows to go off-air. Kids WB hasn’t made any official statements regarding ‘Gloopy and Glitter’s’ return, but I’ll make sure to update the forum if news comes in. User7: GloopTroop Posted on October 24, 2023, at 03:30 PM ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ brought something unique to the mix. I’m hoping it’s just a seasonal thing. Maybe they’re planning a holiday special? That’d be awesome to see in December. User8: StarlightShimmer Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:10 PM I’ve seen cases where shows go on hiatus and then come back with a bang. In this case, ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ could use the break to ensure its return is spectacular. Patience is key, folks! User9: TheAnimatedFan Posted on October 24, 2023, at 04:45 PM This isn’t the first time ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ popped back in after a hiatus. I’m confident that ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ will be back. Kids WB seems to like to surprise us with comebacks. Stay tooned! User1: CosmicFan88 Posted on October 24, 2023, at 05:33 PM Appreciate the insight, everyone! Here’s hoping our favorite blobs make a grand return. 'Til then, I guess I’ll catch up on other shows. Let’s keep an eye out for any updates. Keep it cosmic! ✨ Moderator: ToonTalker Posted on October 25, 2023, at 09:00 AM Just a heads-up to all users, Kids WB will be airing marathons of ‘Gloopy and Glitter’ next weekend, which could be a good sign!

User1: Hey everyone! Did you all catch the launch of CW4Kids on the CW today? It was supposed to be this huge rebranding from Kids’ WB, but it all looked pretty much the same to me, just with a different logo. They even had the same schedule and promos. User2: Yeah, I tuned in this morning expecting something totally different, but it was almost like nothing changed. My little brother didn’t even notice the switch to CW4Kids until I pointed out the new logo to him. User3: I read that the real changes are coming in April, with a complete overhaul of the programming block. But starting January 20th, we’re beginning to see some of the 4Kids content making its debut. Seems like they’re starting slow and then hitting us with the big changes later. AnimatedFan4Life: Kind of sad to see Kids’ WB go, but looking forward to seeing what 4Kids does with the block. “Pokemon Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are being added to the schedule later this month, and I can’t wait for those! ToonWatcher: Have you all seen the future programming list? “Chaotic” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” sound interesting. I miss the old 4Kids block, so it’s kind of nostalgic to see them take over CW. User1: Yeah, I noticed “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” got the axe for the new additions. I’m curious how the CW4Kids identity is going to evolve. Will it keep some of that old WB flavor, or are we looking at a total 4Kids takeover? 90sCartoonKid: I think CW4Kids should keep some of the legacy content while bringing in fresh shows. Kids’ WB had some great shows that shouldn’t be forgotten. Here’s hoping the overhaul in April will give us the best of both worlds. MangaManiac: Just waiting for “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds” to hit the CW4Kids lineup. They teased future programming, and that’s what I’m most excited about. 4Kids always did well with Yu-Gi-Oh series. DigiDestined: Kinda mixed feelings about the rebranding. Kids’ WB was iconic, but 4Kids had some solid shows too. The transition period seems like a smart move to not alienate the current viewers. Just hope the overhaul keeps the quality up. SaturdayMorningFan: Noticed the bumpers still had that Kids’ WB vibe with just a logo swap. I’m intrigued by how they will rebrand the whole aesthetic come April. This gradual shift could be a good way to ease the audience into the changes. User4: Does anyone know if the timeslots will change drastically? You know, with certain 4Kids shows having particular requirements and all that? TVTimeTraveller: No significant timeslot changes announced yet aside from the two show swaps on Jan 20th. We might see a shuffle in April, but hopefully, they’ll keep the fan-favorites in prime positions. User5: Honestly, as long as they keep airing “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Teen Titans Go!”, my Saturdays are set. Though I am curious to see what new shows 4Kids will bring to the mix, just hope they don’t mess with a good thing! User2: Ditto, I’m all for new content as long as quality doesn’t drop. But hey, it’s 4Kids, they know what they’re doing. Let’s give ‘em a chance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey fellow cartoon fans! Have you checked out the latest schedule change for CW4Kids? Starting January 20, 2024, they’ve shaken things up a bit. I’m digging the addition of “Pokemon Indigo League” to the morning lineup. Feels like a throwback to the old days, doesn’t it? User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Absolutely, User 1! I’m thrilled to see “Pokemon Indigo League” on the schedule. It’s classic! But I’m a bit concerned about “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated” – rumor has it they might not stick around much longer with 4Kids taking over. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): And speaking of throwbacks, my local CW station’s started airing Toonattik on Saturdays, so CW4Kids has been moved to Sundays now. Not sure how I feel about it, but as long as they keep bringing solid shows, I’m good. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ve been enjoying the “Kids’ WB style” branding, it has a nostalgic vibe. But according to some whispers around the web, they’re looking to overhaul that by April. I’m curious to see what the new aesthetic will be once 4Kids fully transitions in. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m kind of split, guys. It’s cool 4Kids is keeping some Kids’ WB content around for transition, but I’m not looking forward to saying goodbye to “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby Doo: MI.” They’re a staple for my weekend cartoon binge. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @ToonSquadMember, I feel you. But hey, we’re also getting some new shows in the future, like “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” and “Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds.” Change can be good, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): New shows are great, but I’m a bit dubious about “GoGoRiki” and “Viva Pinata.” Not exactly the hard hitters like some of the current or former programming. Hope they hold up. BTW, has anyone got intel on if “Teen Titans Go!” will continue to be part of the new look? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): @RetroTooner From what I hear, “Teen Titans Go!” is performing well with the audience, so I think it’s safe for now. But you know how it goes with network decisions. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Fingers crossed they keep the right mix of the old and the new. A nod to their history with Kids’ WB but still keeping it fresh for the new generation. It’s all about that balance! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Well said, DigitalPokeFan003. Let’s keep the conversation going and be sure to update each other with any new developments regarding the CW4Kids schedule or news. Until then, let’s enjoy the nostalgia trip with the current lineup! Write a follow up where XS, TTG, BTBATB and JT will stay until late March User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey everyone! Got some exciting updates about our beloved CW4Kids schedule! Looks like “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “Johnny Test” will be with us until at least late March. Seems like they want to give us a proper send-off for these classics. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, that’s fantastic news! Especially happy about “Xiaolin Showdown” sticking around – that show has some of the most creative showdowns ever animated. And “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” has that perfect mix of action and humor. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Relieved to hear “Teen Titans Go!” is staying put for a bit longer. It’s like the ultimate comfort food of cartoons – always gives me a good laugh. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Agreed! And while “Johnny Test” may not be everyone’s cup of tea, it’s kind of grown on me over the years. It’ll be somewhat bittersweet to see these titles go, but I’m also looking forward to what the new lineup will be like! User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Late March, huh? Gives us a bit more time to prepare for the transition. I’m really curious how they will wrap things up with these shows. Hope they do it in a way that honors their legacy on the block. User 8 (ComicBookJones): I gotta say, this schedule has been a staple of my weekend chill time. “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” is my personal favorite—nothing beats classic Batman teamed up with other heroes from the DC universe. But hey, I’m always game for new adventures. Change is the spice of life, right? User 6 (RetroTooner): Most definitely! Change keeps things fresh. But before we say goodbye to these shows, we should definitely enjoy them while they last. And maybe even have a marathon before the big switch! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): A marathon sounds like a plan! I’m in. And let’s keep each other posted on when new shows get announced. The wait for “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” is killing me, though! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Love the positive vibes and enthusiasm, folks! We’ll definitely plan out that marathon. In the meantime, let’s continue to support our favorite shows till the very end. Late March will come sooner than we think, so let’s savor the moments. Keep tuning in, and keep this forum alive with updates! Write a follow up where Kirby replaces The Hollow NEXT WEEK, also Code Lyoko runs out of new episodes next week, and will be going into rerun mode until it’s removal in early March, Scooby is leaving as soon as it runs out, being replaced with Ultimate Muscle User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Breaking news for you CW4Kids fans! Next week brings a couple of big changes to our Sunday lineup. “The Hollow” is taking a bow and making room for “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” to swoop in. Also, looks like we’ve reached the end of the line for new “Code Lyoko” episodes; they’ll be starting reruns next week until its scheduled removal in early March. User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Yes! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya!” is coming back? That’s awesome! Kirby’s adventures never get old. I’m here for those monster battles and Dedede’s shenanigans. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Meanwhile, feeling a little melancholic about “Code Lyoko.” It’s been one of the best sci-fi toons out there. Hope they give it a solid rerun send-off. And what about “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated”? User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): @Anime_Avenger, “SDMI” is reportedly on the way out too. Word is it’ll be replaced by “Ultimate Muscle” as soon as it runs out of episodes. Guess we’re heading toward a more action-packed slate? User 6 (RetroTooner): “Ultimate Muscle,” huh? That’s a blast from the wrestling ring past! I did enjoy the mix of humor and action in that show. Hopefully, it’ll bring some good energy to the block. User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): While it’s sad to see “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” phase out, “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” might just fill that void. They both have that unique blend of action and humor that can really capture that CW4Kids spirit. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I’m curious about this shift towards action-oriented programming. I’ll miss the mystery vibe from “Scooby-Doo,” but I remember “Ultimate Muscle” being quite the ride. Definitely gonna give “Kirby” a shot too! User 5 (ToonSquadMember): It’s always hard to say goodbye to beloved shows, but CW4Kids has always been about mixing things up. Let’s keep supporting the block. Who knows? Maybe these changes will introduce us to some new favorites! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Changes or not, Sunday morning cartoons are a ritual! “Kirby” and “Ultimate Muscle” will make for a fun combo. Let’s give these new shows a warm welcome while we take that last lap with “Code Lyoko.” It’ll be a bittersweet March for sure. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Couldn’t have said it better myself. It’s all about ushering in the new era while bidding a proper farewell to the old. Let’s enjoy them all for now, and as always, keep each other in the loop with any new info! Happy viewing, everyone! Write a follow up where since one of the upcoming shows is very light hearted, it is assumed it will replace both Titans and Johnny User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Time for another update on the ever-evolving CW4Kids scene! With the departure of some of our beloved shows and a few new reveals about the upcoming programming, there are strong indications that one particularly light-hearted show is getting primed to take the slots of both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Whaaat? Both “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” might get swapped out for just one show? As much as I enjoy a fun, light-hearted series, that’s a lot of zany energy to replace. I wonder what show can handle that task. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): I bet it’s going to be “GoGoRiki.” That’s the one I’ve heard is all about that fun vibe with a splash of learning. It’s quite the shift from our usual Saturday/Sunday morning slapstick, but change keeps things interesting, right? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): I’ll miss the antics of “Teen Titans Go!” for sure, but maybe “GoGoRiki” will have that same kind of quirky appeal? We could use a fresh flavor after so much time, and a move towards a lighter-hearted program could be just the thing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Replacing both at once seems like a big gamble, especially given how solid “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” are as standalones. But hey, I guess we’ve gotta trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Still, I’ll hold a little vigil for our departing shows. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): No more “Johnny Test” whirlwinds and “Teen Titans” craziness? That’s a chunk of my Sunday routine about to change. But these shake-ups usually bring in something fresh, so I’m keeping an open mind about “GoGoRiki.” User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m up for new shows but I really hope the replacement has the charm and wit of “Titans” and “Johnny.” Otherwise, it might feel like too much of a void. Change is good…when it’s the right change. User 8 (ComicBookJones): “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test” dropping in one go seems like the end of an era. Fingers crossed “GoGoRiki” can fill those shoes with its own style. I’m always ready for more toon goodness, so bring it on! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): You’ve all got the spirit! As we anticipate “GoGoRiki” (or whatever the new show might be), let’s not forget there are still a few weeks to savor “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Let’s enjoy the last moments with our favorites and stay tuned for what’s next—this is the story of Saturday/Sunday morning TV, always in motion. Keep chatting and sharing what you hear, folks! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Heads up, toon troops! Have you all had a chance to check out the new CW4Kids website? It feels like a blast from the past—right now, it’s got that basic Weebly vibe going on. And get this, even though we’ve been watching “Pokemon” and “Sonic X” for a while, it looks like they’ve only just got their show pages up and running. User 11 (WebWizard): Oh definitely, the CW4Kids website is pretty nostalgic with its simplicity. Kinda surprised “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” still have their old pages there, though. Talk about remnants of the Kids’ WB era! User 12 (4KidsMod): Hey User 11, glad you’ve noticed—and sorry about the confusion! The transition from kidswb.com is a work in progress. Over the next few months, you guys will see the CW4Kids site evolve to reflect our full rebrand, much like the classic 4Kids.tv! Expect a full redirect by early April, and tons of cool updates along the way. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Yay for updates! The current site is a bit of a time warp, lol. Can’t wait to see the full 4Kids makeover. Here’s hoping they’ll keep some of the interactivity and games we used to love on 4Kids.tv. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): @4KidsMod, thanks for the heads up! Really hoping for those interactive elements. Will the new site have streaming options for episodes too? That’d be a sweet addition. User 12 (4KidsMod): Streaming is definitely on our radar, Anime_Avenger. Can’t spill all the beans yet, but we’re aiming to create a space that’s not just informational but also interactive and entertaining. Stay tuned! User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Awesome to hear! I’ve got some fond memories browsing 4Kids.tv back in the day. The CW4Kids website holding onto old show pages is kind of like keeping a piece of history alive. Super curious to see them transition to the new lineup though. User 8 (ComicBookJones): Who knew a website could be so nostalgic? I guess it’s part of the growing pains. Here’s hoping for a smooth transition. And thanks, @4KidsMod, for keeping us in the loop! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Sounds like the digital side of CW4Kids is going to catch up with the broadcasting side soon. Until then, let’s make the most of the retro look and feel of the site. And let’s hope they keep that corner for fan art and forums—gotta keep our community strong! User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Oh, those forums were the best! Had some cool discussions back in the day. Let’s rally for a platform where we can share our love for all things animated! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Definitely! Engaging with fellow toon fans makes the experience twice as fun. Eager to see what the new CW4Kids site will bring. Light-hearted fun is good, but I’m all for a space that celebrates every kind of animated awesomeness! User 12 (4KidsMod): Couldn’t agree more with you all! Your enthusiasm is what fuels this future site. Keep the feedback coming—we want to create a website that you will all enjoy visiting. And, of course, we’ll keep the nostalgia alive while introducing new features for our wonderful community of cartoon aficionados. Stay animated, everyone! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Whew, what a day for CW4Kids! Endings and beginnings all over the place. ‘Squish’ and ‘The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ have left the block, while ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ have officially joined the lineup. And did anyone catch that climactic ‘Code Lyoko’ episode? XANA’s defeat felt so final! User 13 (LyokoFanatic): Totally did not expect to feel so many emotions with XANA’s defeat on ‘Code Lyoko’ today. I heard next week will be a clip show, then we’re into reruns. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. I’m not ready. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): Big day indeed! And that ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated’ episode—Fred sacrificing the Mystery Machine was low-key heartbreaking. They’re really ramping up to that finale. Also, kudos to the CW4Kids team for those cool show teases during the commercials, It began super intense with Pokemon Horizons and TMNT, but then had a calm light hearted GoGoRiki scene at the end, User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Those show promos had me hyped! Excited to see what’s lined up. But man, ‘Scooby Doo’ is hitting some serious notes. The next two weeks are going to be intense as they wrap up Professor Pericles’ dark plan. Can’t believe we’re already approaching ‘Come Undone.’ User 2 (Anime_Avenger): Hey, did anyone else feel that today was like a rollercoaster ride of emotions? From highs with ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Sonic X’ arriving, to the nostalgic lows with ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby Doo’… man, that got real. Can’t wait to see how they’ll conclude that epic storyline! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Absolutely, today was crazy! Seeing ‘Pokemon’ on the schedule brings back so many memories. And ‘Sonic X’ joining is just perfect timing. Sad to see ‘Code Lyoko’ in its final moments, though. That ending! But like everyone else, totally floored by Fred’s choice to destroy the Mystery Machine. That’s commitment! User 14 (NewToonWatcher): Just started tuning into CW4Kids and what a start it is! Pokémon’s a classic, can’t deny that, but I was really pulled in by ‘Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.’ That scene with Fred had my jaw on the floor! So, this is the kind of drama I’ve been missing out on? User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): Yep, NewToonWatcher, welcome to the wild world of CW4Kids! Today felt like a season finale of sorts. ‘Code Lyoko’ wrapping up, ‘Scooby-Doo’ on the edge of something huge, and honestly, those teases for the new shows? I’m intrigued. Like a whole new chapter is opening up! User 8 (ComicBookJones): Kudos to CW4Kids for keeping the suspense alive with those teases. New chapters indeed! Though, it’s bittersweet to lose ‘Code Lyoko.’ And ‘Scooby-Doo’—it’s like we’re watching them all grow up before our eyes. There’s something special about this era of cartoons, friends. User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): As someone who grew up with the original CW4Kids, it’s heartwarming to see new life being breathed into it—even if it means saying goodbye to some favorites. That ‘Scooby-Doo’ scene hit different, for sure. Props to CW4Kids for continuing the Saturday morning tradition and keeping it fresh for all of us. User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): Hey toon enthusiasts, big announcements for the next couple of weeks on CW4Kids! Next week, get ready for a schedule shake-up. They’re airing the epic “Spider-Verse” movie that’ll cover the later part of our usual cartoon time. And guess what’s swinging back the week after? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” – and here we thought it might’ve been gone for good! User 15 (MultiverseMarvel): “Spider-Verse” on CW4Kids is HUGE! That movie was a game-changer for animated superhero films. I’m stoked for newcomers to see it if they missed out. Plus, more Miles Morales is always a win in my book! User 9 (KirbyStarWarrior): Totally amped for “Spider-Verse,” but let’s talk about “Gloopy and Glitter” making a comeback. Didn’t think we’d see them again so soon. Their sparkly antics were sorely missed! Here’s to hoping they’ve got fresh adventures up their sleeves. User 3 (SaturdayMorningNostalgia): “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” returning to the lineup feels like finding a lost treasure. Thought we waved goodbye back in November, but CW4Kids is full of surprises. Also, super curious about how they’re gonna fit “Spider-Verse” into the schedule – a special marathon event, maybe? User 4 (TheCartoonCritic): Amazing news! “Spider-Verse” is a brilliant move for CW4Kids – it’s a critical darling and fan fave. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” the hiatus must’ve worked in their favor. Crossing my fingers for a strong return. The show had a charm that was pure CW4Kids magic. User 7 (DigitalPokeFan003): Whoa! “Spider-Verse” is a must-watch for anyone who hasn’t seen it yet. And I’m hyped about the return of “Gloopy and Glitter,” just in time too. Their planet-hopping shenanigans were the perfect mix of silly and awesome. User 16 (TooniverseTrekker): Did NOT see that coming! “Spider-Verse” is a killer addition to the CW4Kids slate, and “Gloopy and Glitter” just tips the excitement scale. Is CW4Kids working on upping their game or what? Between this and the new shows, there’s something special brewing. User 2 (Anime_Avenger): A bit of a cinematic detour with “Spider-Verse,” then right back to our blobby buddies – that’s classic CW4Kids unpredictability for you. Can’t wait to see how “Gloopy and Glitter” have evolved since their hiatus. This block keeps getting better and better! User 10 (CartoonConnoisseur): Between a blockbuster movie event and the return of a beloved series, CW4Kids is really pulling out all the stops. “Spider-Verse” will bring in the viewers, and the comeback of “Gloopy and Glitter” right after? That’s just savvy scheduling. User 5 (ToonSquadMember): I’m delighted about “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” coming back, but I do hope they haven’t lost their original spark. Long breaks can make you nervous, but also thrilled. And “Spider-Verse”? Well, that speaks for itself! User 1 (Club Toon Moderator): The next few weeks look nicely packed with surprises and much-awaited returns. Whether it’s for “Spider-Verse” or “Gloopy and Glitter,” make sure to reclaim your spot on the couch. And keep the forum lit with reactions and predictions, folks!

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Amended Schedule Shake-Up – No More TTG, BTBATB, or The Hollow!” User1: ToonGuru42 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:15 AM Just saw the new CW4Kids schedule that debuted this weekend. It’s a total overhaul! No more “Teen Titans Go!” or “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” and “The Hollow” is gone too. “Ultimate Muscle” stepped into the mystery slot after “Scooby-Doo.” How’s everyone feeling about this? User2: LaughsAndToons Posted on February 15, 2023, at 8:45 AM Honestly? I’m a bit shocked. I knew changes were coming but seeing “TTG” and “Batman” actually gone hits differently. “The Hollow” leaving wasn’t a surprise, but “Ultimate Muscle” is an interesting choice… Guess it’s full steam ahead into action land on CW4Kids now! User3: ScoobyFan1999 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:05 AM I’m gonna miss “Scooby-Doo.” It was the one show that brought me to CW4Kids in the first place. 😢 “Ultimate Muscle” has its charm, sure, but nothing fills that mystery gang-shaped hole in my heart. User4: SaturdayRetooned Posted on February 15, 2023, at 9:40 AM Whoa, it’s like an end of an era without “TTG” and “Batman.” I grew up with those! Still, “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic trip for me. Plus, I’m ready to give “GoGoRiki” a shot. It’s been groomed to take Johnny’s spot, which I’m curious to see how that pans out. User5: AnimeAnthology Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:00 AM “GoGoRiki” stepping up could be cool. We need something light-hearted if everything else is going to be packed with punches and super moves. It’s tough saying goodbye to classics, but I’m rooting for “GoGoRiki” to be our new comedic anchor. Moderator: ToonTimeModerator Posted on February 15, 2023, at 10:35 AM Remember, change is part of the Saturday morning landscape, folks. Let’s cherish the memories and welcome new shows. Stay positive and give the new lineup a fair shot! And who knows? Maybe some of your old faves might reappear in the future. User6: PowerPuffPatrol Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:00 AM As a fan of classic action toons, I’m excited for “Ultimate Muscle.” It remains true to the essence of what made the original 4Kids block great. Plus, the humor is on point. “GoGoRiki” better bring its A-game for laughs though! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 15, 2023, at 11:25 AM I’m keeping an open mind, but not gonna lie, replacing “TTG” and “Batman” feels like a gamble. “GoGoRiki” has some pretty big shoes to fill. Hope it lives up to the hype as one-half of our comedic flagship come mid-April! User8: ComedyCartoonCritic Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:01 PM Yep, the flagship funny shows are going to be crucial. With action dominating the block, we need “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to balance things out. Comedy is timeless, even in a world of high stakes and super brawls! User9: CaptainNostalgia Posted on February 15, 2023, at 12:45 PM Forever in my heart, “TTG,” “Batman,” and “The Hollow.” 😢 Hey @ComedyCartoonCritic, I agree! We need good comedy to lighten the mood with all these action-packed shows. I’m ready for “GoGoRiki” to bring back the laughs and round out the weekends. Let’s hope they’re up to the task. User10: AbsoluteAnim8 Posted on February 15, 2023, at 1:10 PM A schedule shift like this is bold but could be brilliant. CW4Kids knows what they’re doing… I think. “Ultimate Muscle” brings the fun and action. Plus, “GoGoRiki” seems whimsical enough to be a hit with the fam. Looking forward to it!

Write a TVTropes Screwed By The Network example where (Most shows from Kids WB were screwed over by the blocks transition to The CW4Kids, Some shows like Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated and Ultimate Spider-Man were booted off after they had ran out of new episodes, while other like Squish, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers and Teen Titans Go were kicked randomly, wheras Xiaolin Showdown and Johnny Test held on till the revamp in April, In the odd instance of The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, which was cancelled by Kids WB, 4Kids reversed the decision) Screwed By The Network / Western Animation The transition of Kids’ WB to The CW4Kids under the programming management of 4Kids Entertainment was a bumpy road for many fan-favorite shows. While some managed to secure their spot for a while, the destiny of many others was less fortunate, as they seemed to be screwed over by the network. For starters, stalwarts like “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” enjoyed their run until the well of new episodes dried up. They were then unceremoniously ditched from the lineup, leaving fans in the lurch without their beloved series. On the flip side, hits like “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “Teen Titans Go!” fell victim to random expulsion. Despite solid ratings and devoted fanbases, these series were unexpectedly axed with the network offering little to no explanation, leading to speculation about the reasons behind their sudden disappearance. There were survivors of the initial culling, though their fate was only delayed. “Xiaolin Showdown” and “Johnny Test,” both anchor shows of the erstwhile block, clung on by their fingertips until the April revamp spelled the end of their tenure on The CW4Kids. It was a clear indicator that the new management was steering the block in a different direction, prioritizing their own branded content over the Kids’ WB legacy. However, in a twist befitting the most intricate of animated plots, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” experienced a rollercoaster ride with the network. Originally axed by Kids’ WB, indicating a likely bleak future for the blobby duo, the new landlords at 4Kids stepped in and performed a surprise about-face. In a move that delighted fans, 4Kids reversed the cancellation, restoring “Gloopy and Glitter” to the lineup and crowning them as one of the block’s flagship shows. The stark differences in these shows’ fates highlighted the uncertain world of network television programming where ratings, brand synergy, and management whims can make or break shows, often leaving both their characters and their fans on cliffhangers without resolution. Write a Adored By The Network example saying that Code Lyoko was originally to be removed in April, but was kept, also talk about the flagship shows, and one is an example of Network To The Rescue Adored By The Network / Western Animation While many once-beloved series from the Kids’ WB days faced the chopping block during the transition to The CW4Kids, managed by 4Kids Entertainment, “Code Lyoko” emerged as a remarkable exception and stands as a textbook example of being adored by the network. Initially, “Code Lyoko” seemed destined to share the same fate as its fellow shows, with an April removal marked on the network’s calendar. Fans prepared to bid farewell to the adventures of Jeremie, Aelita, and the rest of the Lyoko Warriors. However, as the dreaded month approached, it became apparent that the network had a change of heart. To the joy and surprise of its dedicated fan base, “Code Lyoko” remained steadfast in its programming slot even beyond the April revamp. This decision to hold onto “Code Lyoko” indicated that the show held a special place in the network’s favor, perhaps due to its unique blend of 2D and 3D animation, its engaging storytelling, or its consistent performance with viewers. Ensuring the show’s continued presence amidst the sea of new and returning programs, it became clear that “Code Lyoko” was more than a show for The CW4Kids—it was a treasured jewel. In discussing flagship shows adored by the network, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is an exemplary illustration of the ‘Network to the Rescue’ trope in action. Although they were initially canceled by Kids’ WB, 4Kids Entertainment, recognizing the potential in the series and the love it received from the audience, took the extraordinary step to revive it. Not only was the show brought back to the airwaves, but it was also positioned as one of the block’s leading attractions. “GoGoRiki,” too, enjoyed an elevated status as a network darling, quickly becoming a cornerstone of the comedy lineup. After taking over the slot from an established favorite (“Teen Titans Go!”), “GoGoRiki” further solidified its standing by later moving into the “Johnny Test” slot, indicating the network’s significant investment in the show’s broad appeal and success. These instances show that while the whims and strategies of network executives can often lead to the untimely end of many fan-favorite shows, they can also serve as the saviors for some, providing them with unexpected lifelines and platforms for greater success. In the case of “Code Lyoko,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “GoGoRiki,” The CW4Kids indeed showed a level of adoration that would secure these series’ legacies for years to come. Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB October 2022 Schedule - Future Predictions?” User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 7:54 PM Hey fellow animation aficionados!

User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on October 5, 2022, at 8:45 PM I’m bummed about “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” potentially leaving. They’re like the backbone of modern ‘toon comedy on Kids’ WB. I hope they replace them with shows of equal caliber. Also, “Xiaolin Showdown” feels so nostalgic. Love that it’s still on! User4: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:05 PM Mid-2023? That’s quite the heads-up, but “Gumball” has had a great run, and “Craig of the Creek” is consistently good. Still, I’m stoked “Code Lyoko” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” are holding strong—quality picks right there. User5: WBAnimationFan Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:30 PM True, it’s sad to hear about “Gumball” and “Craig,” but “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is such a breath of fresh air! I have high hopes for it to take the comedy reigns. Also, is anyone else loving the resurgence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Moderator: KidsWB_Mod Posted on October 5, 2022, at 9:55 PM Evening, folks! Let’s remember that schedules are always subject to change, and nothing’s set in stone. “Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” have been phenomenal series for Kids’ WB, and we love them as much as you do. Keep this thread going with any updates or fresh rumors - our community thrives on the discussions! User6: SaturdayMornLover Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:20 PM It’s always interesting to see how Kids’ WB evolves. “Gumball” and “Craig” will be missed, but changes sometimes bring unexpected gems. Plus, “Teen Titans Go!” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” always deliver, so I’m feeling optimistic! User7: ToonTalker Posted on October 5, 2022, at 10:45 PM I think I speak for a lot of us when I say that losing “Gumball” would be the end of an era. I’ve grown up with that show! “Craig of the Creek” is a hit in our household too. They’ve knocked it out of the park with these programs, so here’s hoping Kids’ WB has some aces up their sleeves for the next lineup. But I’m super glad “Johnny Test” is sticking around - that show’s like comfort food for my Saturday morning routine! User1: TooniverseTim Posted on October 5, 2022, at 11:02 PM Great points, everyone! Kids’ WB has a knack for keeping things fresh while still respecting the classics. Losing “Gumball” and “Craig” would be tough, but if “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is any indicator, I’m sure we’ve got some awesome toons on the horizon. Times change, and so do schedules. Let’s enjoy our faves while we can and look to the future of our beloved Kids’ WB! Keep the updates coming, folks! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebrand to 4Kids Takeover - What’s Next?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:32 AM So, it’s official – 4Kids is taking over and we’ve got a rebrand coming after Christmas. The station name’s changing, and we’ll see incremental updates in the coming months. Man, I remember when “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” were added back in September 2022. And then how “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” got switched out for “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” and “Squish” this January… 2022/2023 was a crazy year for Kids’ WB. And now it’s almost all over. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on November 8, 2023, at 8:50 AM I’m feeling pretty nostalgic, Tim. Kids’ WB has been a constant in my life since… well, forever. Excited yet uneasy about what 4Kids will bring to the table. Will they respect our favorites or is everything we love about Kids’ WB going to vanish? User3: ClassicToonGal Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:15 AM Change is always scary, but sometimes it can bring cool surprises. Remember the 4Kids lineup from the early 2000s? They had some hits! I’ll miss Kids’ WB for sure, but I’m going to keep an open mind about this whole rebranding thing. Fingers crossed they do right by us! User4: AnimationAdmirer Posted on November 8, 2023, at 9:45 AM It’s kind of the end of an era, isn’t it? But let’s be fair, Kids’ WB has been evolving over the years. “Scooby-Doo: MI” was such a refreshing new take for the franchise. As long as quality content continues, I’m in. But, let’s not forget that 4Kids can be… controversial, to say the least. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:00 AM Gotta admit, I wasn’t ready for this news. I’m not just worried about the shows, but what about the branding, the vibe? Kids’ WB had a special feel to it, you know? 4Kids has big shoes to fill. Hope they start off by actually listening to the fans. Moderator: WBToonMod Posted on November 8, 2023, at 10:25 AM Everyone, let’s remember there’s always a silver lining. Kids’ WB has been paving the way for quality programming for years. Though the impending changes have raised some eyebrows, we’re optimistic 4Kids is aware of the community’s attachment and will do their utmost to enhance the experience. Stay tuned for announcements and share any news as it comes! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on November 8, 2023, at 11:30 AM It’s bittersweet, but you can’t stop progress, I guess. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” was a pleasant surprise that grew on me, and “Ultimate Spider-Man” Was a funny take on our favourite web-slinging superhero. Let’s hope this new chapter brings even more gems like those. User7: RetroRanger Posted on November 8, 2023, at 12:15 PM 2022/2023 and ‘crazy’ is an understatement, Tim! Kids’ WB was my go-to Saturday morning destination. But, here’s to new beginnings? Maybe 4Kids will find the balance between innovation and nostalgia. At least that’s what I’m hoping for! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:05 PM Just when I had the schedule memorized… 🙄 But hey, maybe this is a positive shakeup? A good mix of the old and new could keep things fresh. I’m willing to ride this transition out and see where it takes us. Endings are tough, but who knows what cool shows this change might bring? User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on November 8, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m torn. Sure, new shows could be awesome. Still, Kids’ WB was iconic! Losing “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” felt like the beginning of the end. Honestly, I just hope 4Kids keeps some of the Kid’s WB spirit alive in whatever they plan to do next. User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on November 8, 2023, at 2:00 PM All we can do is wait and watch. Whatever 4Kids decides to do, they’ve got a legacy to uphold. Thanks for all the memories, Kids’ WB—it was a great ride. As for 4Kids, you’ve got some passionate fans to impress! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Rebranding Update - New Station Name & Weekend Scheduling Changes” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:01 AM The news is out! Kids’ WB’s rebrand under 4Kids is official, and the new station name is “CW4Kids”! Interestingly enough, my local CW affiliate is bringing “CW4Kids” to Sundays in the next few weeks because “Toonattik” is taking over the Saturday morning slot, which is big news since it features “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V,” a series we haven’t seen on Kids’ WB. Schedule-wise, they say it’s sticking for now, but we can expect incremental changes till February to let “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby-Doo,” and “Spider-Man” wrap up their current episodes. Though, did anyone else catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon last month? Feels like they might be accelerating the end of “Mystery Inc.” User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on December 3, 2023, at 8:30 AM CW4Kids, huh? That takes me back. Good to know they’re being considerate with the shows currently airing, allowing them to finish properly. But I did catch that “Scooby-Doo” marathon—seems like they’re burning off episodes. I’m guessing they’ll do the same for others if they’re impatient to start the new lineup. User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:10 AM Wow, a Sunday slot for CW4Kids is kinda cool, actually! Gives us two mornings of cartoons. “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” on “Toonattik” is an unexpected treat. Looks like they’re mixing things up right from the start. About the current shows… ever since “Gloopy and Glitter” got its send-off marathons, I’ve been bracing for a sweep. Gotta enjoy “Code Lyoko” and the rest while we still can! User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on December 3, 2023, at 9:45 AM As a “Scooby-Doo” enthusiast, I’m split between being glad we got a marathon and concerned they’re trying to wrap up the series too fast. Hopefully, they’ll honor the remaining episodes with proper scheduling. Not thrilled about a rushed finish to “Mystery Inc.” User5: NewEraToonFan Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:00 AM So it begins… CW4Kids. Across both days? That marathon did feel like a burn-off for “Scooby.” Strategic? Maybe. All I can say is I hope “Code Lyoko” doesn’t get the same treatment. They better not cut “Ultimate Spider-Man” short either—if they’ve got episodes to finish, let’s see them through! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on December 3, 2023, at 10:35 AM Just a quick reminder, gang—let’s stay on topic and keep to what we know for sure. “Toonattik” with “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” is officially added to Saturday mornings, and yes, CW4Kids programming will shift to Sundays soon for some affiliates. We’re also committed to presenting the remaining episodes of current shows before any substantial schedule changes happen. Cheers for your passion, everyone! User6: AnimationAdmirer Posted on December 3, 2023, at 11:15 AM So “Toonattik” and “Yu-Gi-Oh!” back-to-back with “CW4Kids,” that’s almost too good. As for the current lineup, I’m hopeful they wrap things up respectfully, but that “Scooby” marathon has me guessing we won’t have “Mystery Inc.” till February as proposed. Crossing fingers they don’t rush “Code Lyoko”! User7: RetroRanger Posted on December 3, 2023, at 12:00 PM Seems like CW4Kids is laying the groundwork for big changes. “Toonattik” is a nice surprise, but let’s not overlook the impact on our current faves. If they’re trying to usher in a new era, I get it, but let’s savor the classics a bit longer. A marathon for “Scooby” was nice, but it’s got me worried about goodbye pacing for the other long-runners. User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on December 3, 2023, at 1:30 PM Mixed feelings here. CW4Kids on Sundays means double the fun, but also signals serious shifts on the horizon. Here’s hoping they aren’t just burning off episodes to expedite the rebrand. And let’s be real, marathons can be fun, but they can also mean “we’re speeding to the finish line.” I want a proper finale for “Code Lyoko,” not a rushed conclusion. User9: AnimationIsLife Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:10 PM Regardless of our attachment to the shows, I suppose we should embrace the new direction under CW4Kids. Marathons and schedule changes can be bittersweet, yet they could be necessary for transitioning to the fresh lineup. As long as they’re treating our current beloved shows with dignity, I’m onboard. Here’s to a respectful send-off for “Code Lyoko,” “Scooby,” and “Spider-Man,” and to a new chapter with CW4Kids! User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on December 3, 2023, at 2:35 PM Absolutely, let’s keep the love going for the shows we’ve enjoyed for years, and welcome the newcomers with open arms. CW4Kids—show us what you’ve got! Ready for the ride, one Sunday morning at a time!

Starting late March, CW4Kids is revamping their in-between shows shorts. We’re getting “GoGoWiki,” a fun segment with info about “GoGoRiki” characters. Plus, there’s “Pikachu’s Jukebox” bringing us all those catchy Pokémon songs. It means we’re waving goodbye to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch.” Thoughts on this update? User2: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 6, 2024, at 6:30 AM Interesting twist! I enjoyed the laughs from “Lamput” and the quirky creativity of “Planet Sketch.” Still, “GoGoWiki” sounds like a neat way to dive deeper into “GoGoRiki.” As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” you can’t go wrong with Pokémon tunes – they’re classics! User3: 4KidsFaithful Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:15 AM Gotta admit, I’ll miss “Lamput’s” absurdity and “Planet Sketch’s” antics. They were great palette cleansers between shows. “GoGoWiki” could be educational though? Could add another layer to the “GoGoRiki” experience. And let’s be honest, who isn’t gonna sing along with “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? 😄 User4: ScoobySquadMember Posted on March 6, 2024, at 7:45 AM Loved the randomness of “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but change can be refreshing. “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a brilliant addition, tapping into that Pokémon fever! “GoGoWiki” should be really engaging for “GoGoRiki” fans – more character lore could indeed be cool. User5: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:05 AM I’ll pour one out for “Lamput” – that short had style. But “Pikachu’s Jukebox”? That’s gonna be a hit! Kids love those songs. And “GoGoWiki” might turn out to be a clever way to deepen viewer connection with “GoGoRiki.” Let’s give these new shorts a chance! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:35 AM Let’s appreciate the time we have left with “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch!” While they’ve been staples, it’s exciting to introduce “GoGoWiki” and “Pikachu’s Jukebox” to our young and curious audience. It’s all about keeping things fresh and interesting here at CW4Kids! User6: NostalgicNick Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Change is constant, isn’t it? “Lamput” was a dose of clever visual comedy, and “Planet Sketch” had an off-the-wall charm. Curious to see what these new shorts add to the overall vibe. Pokémon is always a win, in my book! User7: RetroRanger Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:30 AM Both “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch” had their magic, but the future looks bright. “GoGoWiki” is a unique concept – it’ll be neat to get to know the “GoGoRiki” characters better. As for “Pikachu’s Jukebox,” I’m ready for some sing-along nostalgia! User8: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM Totally ready for “Pikachu’s Jukebox” – Pokémon songs hold a special place in my heart. “GoGoWiki” is an interesting educational spin, sure to enthrall curious minds. Sad to bid farewell to “Lamput” and “Planet Sketch,” but they’ve had a good run. Onwards to new laughs and learning! Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB Ratings Discussion - Post Gumball & Craig Era” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:05 PM Hey all! With “The Amazing World of Gumball” and “Craig of the Creek” booted off the list since January, I’ve been crunching some numbers to see which show’s been drawing in the viewers. At the top right now? “Code Lyoko!” The virtual world of Lyoko and the real world antics are really resonating with the fans. Anyone else surprised? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on August 17, 2023, at 12:36 PM Honestly, not shocked that “Code Lyoko” is pulling in big numbers. The blend of CGI and traditional animation is unique and the storyline’s been super captivating, especially the newer episodes. It’s got that multidimensional (pun intended!) appeal, you know? User3: LyokoChampion Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:15 PM Absolutely saw this coming! “Code Lyoko” has always been underrated in my opinion. With Gumball and Craig out of the picture, it was due its moment in the spotlight. The story arcs this season are top-notch! User4: AnimationAce Posted on August 17, 2023, at 1:45 PM I’m a little surprised, only because I thought “Teen Titans Go!” or “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” would have taken the top spot. They’ve both been consistently strong, too. But hats off to “Code Lyoko”—that show knows how to keep audiences hooked. User5: ToonTracker Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:05 PM “Teen Titans Go!” is a ratings magnet for sure, same with “Scooby-Doo,” but “Code Lyoko” has that je ne sais quoi! Plus, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is not that far behind either. The humor and Marvel tie-in are a massive draw for viewers. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on August 17, 2023, at 2:45 PM Great to see such active analysis from our community! “Code Lyoko” is indeed our current ratings leader—well-spotted. Just a friendly reminder that viewership can fluctuate season by season, so let’s keep cheering on all our favorite shows on Kids’ WB. Remember, every show has its day! User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:15 PM I respect “Code Lyoko” for its clever concept and loyal fanbase, but I gotta say, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is my go-to. Those guest appearances from other Marvel characters? Priceless. Curious to see if it’ll climb up in the ratings as the season progresses. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on August 17, 2023, at 3:45 PM While “Code Lyoko” is killing it, let’s not sleep on “Scooby-Doo: MI”. It’s the kind of show that grows on you, combining nostalgia with new twists. I’m calling it - it’s going to climb its way up as we get into the heart of this season! Write a follow up where SDMI, G&G, USM and BTBATB start premieres again in September, incidentally no new episodes for Squish or the Adrenalini Brothers Forum Thread Title: “Kids’ WB September Schedule Buzz - Premieres & Hiatuses” User1: SaturdayToonFan Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:00 AM It’s happening, folks! September is here and with it comes fresh new episodes of “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” back on Kids’ WB. Maybe the network is trying to bump up those ratings before the rumored rebranding? Looks like “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” won’t be sharing the spotlight though. No premieres for them this cycle. What’s everyone’s take on this? User2: VintageToonLover Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:22 AM Stoked for more “Scooby-Doo: MI,” that’s for sure! As for “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” it sounds like they might be on the chopping block if they’re not getting new eps, which is a bummer because they had potential. At least “Code Lyoko” still seems to be going strong, if the rumors about it topping the ratings are true. User3: LyokoChampion Posted on September 2, 2023, at 11:45 AM Yeah, the return of “Code Lyoko” is what I’m most excited about—always here for more adventures in Lyoko. But “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Batman: The Brave and the Bold”? Solid comebacks. Maybe Kids’ WB is doubling down on their tried-and-true heroes to build up some hype. User4: AnimationAce Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:15 PM The premieres make sense as a way to lock in viewers. “Gloopy and Glitter” always bring some light-hearted fun, so that’s a big win in my book. As for “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” might be time to kiss them goodbye if they’re not getting any new content—especially with the rumored changes ahead. User5: ToonTracker Posted on September 2, 2023, at 12:35 PM I’ll miss “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” but the premieres of other series suggest Kids’ WB is banking on their heavy-hitters before the transition kicks in. “Spider-Man” and “Batman” are franchises with guaranteed fanbases, after all. Smart move, if you ask me. Moderator: KidsWBModerator Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:00 PM Just a reminder from your friendly neighborhood mod: let’s keep the conversation going on what we’re excited about and wish lists for future schedules! While we speculate on the reasons behind the programming decisions, let’s also appreciate the hard work put into each and every one of our shows. User6: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on September 2, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, I’m here for the new “Ultimate Spider-Man” episodes—it’s always a thrill ride. And can we talk about the lore in “Scooby-Doo: MI”? It’s deeper than it gets credit for. “Squish” and “Adrenalini,” they were good for a light watch, but maybe it’s time for something new. User7: ScoobyGangMember Posted on September 2, 2023, at 2:00 PM Never understood why “Scooby-Doo: MI” wasn’t as hyped as it should be. It’s great storytelling! Also excited for “Gloopy and Glitter.” They’re kind of niche, but that’s their charm. Curious how the ratings will be affected by the return of these series. “Squish” and “Adrenalini” lack new episodes, but maybe they’ll come back around eventually? 4Kids Entertainment November 28, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Transition of Kids’ WB to CW4Kids - Incremental Changes and Introduction of New Lineup Dear CW Executives, We are reaching out to update you about the exciting changes planned for the transition of Kids’ WB into the new CW4Kids program block, which is set to commence following the turn of the year. Our team at 4Kids Entertainment has been diligently working to ensure a seamless transition that respects the legacy of Kids’ WB while introducing a refreshed and engaging lineup tailored to our young audience. As we approach the December 31st timeline, we would like to confirm our plan to officially change the block name to CW4Kids. Alongside this rebranding, we are implementing incremental scheduling updates leading up to our major rebrand launch in mid-April. This will allow us to slowly introduce new series from the 4Kids catalog and to test audience reception to various content formats and arrangements. During this transition, we will maintain the distinctive comic book-style bumpers and aesthetic developed by Kids’ WB, in an effort to preserve a sense of continuity and familiarity for the viewers. This visual style will be replaced with a fresh and contemporary look coinciding with the full spectrum launch of CW4Kids in mid-April. The following flagship shows from 4Kids will spearhead our new programming direction: - “GoGoRiki” – A delightful, light-hearted animated series that is set to become a cornerstone of our comedic lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – The latest installment in the globally popular franchise, continuing the tradition of exciting duel-centric adventures. - “Viva Piñata” – A vibrant animated series based on the popular video game that brings a fun-filled world to our viewers. Additionally, we will carry over two shows from the existing Kids’ WB lineup all the way through to the April rebrand to maintain continuity for our audience. We have selected “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” to be part of the adventure till the final rebrand, based on their long-standing popularity and the passionate fan base they have cultivated over years of broadcast. Please rest assured that we are dedicated to honoring the concluding narratives of outgoing shows, such as “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” and “Ultimate Spider-Man,” providing them with the proper finale as we phase out the current program slate. As we embark on this journey, we are keen to receive ongoing feedback from all parties to ensure that our programming decisions are aligning with network expectations and audience trends. We look forward to this enthralling new phase for the Saturday morning experience, and we are confident that CW4Kids will become a cherished weekend tradition for children across the country. Sincerely, [Your Name] Director of Programming Strategy 4Kids Entertainment Write a follow up email where one Kids WB show has been selected to be part of the permanent CW4Kids lineup, and it is becoming a flagship 4Kids Entertainment December 15, 2023 The CW Television Network 3300 W Olive Ave, Burbank, CA 91505 Attention: CW Programming Department Re: Inclusion of Kids’ WB Show into Permanent CW4Kids Lineup as Flagship Series Dear CW Executives, I hope this message finds you well. Following our previous correspondence, we at 4Kids Entertainment continue to refine and enhance the CW4Kids programming slate in preparation for our mid-April relaunch. Having carefully considered the current Kids’ WB lineup and the response from audiences, we have decided to incorporate one particularly well-received show into the permanent CW4Kids lineup as a flagship series. It is with great excitement that we announce the retention of “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as a mainstay of our new programming block. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” has consistently shown its ability to capture the imagination of our young viewers with its creative storytelling, dynamic characters, and unique style. The universal themes and engaging content have not only resonated with current fans but also demonstrate significant potential to attract new audiences to the CW4Kids block. With the intent of building upon its success, we plan to give “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a prominent position in our schedule. We are fully committed to supporting its production, ensuring the highest quality of future episodes, and integrating the series into our marketing and branding efforts as a representation of the innovative spirit of CW4Kids. We believe that maintaining this element of continuity from the Kids’ WB era is not only a nod to the cherished history of Saturday morning cartoons but also a strategic move that underscores our commitment to high-caliber and beloved programming. Further details about the integration process, including scheduling and promotional activities, will be shared with you shortly. We are confident that this decision will be favorably received by our audience and will become a significant draw for our rebranded block. Once again, we value our partnership with The CW and appreciate your input as we move forward. Together, we look forward to both preserving the legacy of Saturday mornings and forging a new path that excites and delights.

They’re rolling out games now, kind of like the old 4kids.tv days. Plus, they’ve got this 4Kids Points feature going on which is nostalgic for sure. However, the site’s still rockin’ that Weebly look for now, though rumor has it this will be updated in the coming weeks. Anyone else spotted these changes? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:20 AM Oh, man! Just checked it out and it’s a blast from the past with those gaming features—really getting those 4Kids vibes again. 4Kids Points, huh? Could be fun if they’ve got cool rewards like exclusive wallpapers or digital cards. But yeah, that Weebly layout’s gotta go soon if they’re serious about a modern revamp. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on February 14, 2024, at 11:45 AM I noticed the game section too! It’s pretty bare-bones at the moment, but I’m excited about what else they’re planning to add. Those 4Kids Points were a neat incentive back in the day. I’m curious about the kind of rewards they’ll include this time around—maybe sneak peeks at new episodes or character avatars? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:05 PM Games on the CW4Kids site? Sweet! This is a step in the right direction, especially for engaging with younger viewers. And the 4Kids Points system might be a smart move to keep kids coming back to the site. Just hoping the games are more diverse and interactive than before. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on February 14, 2024, at 12:30 PM Definitely digging the inclusion of games, reminds me a lot of the original 4Kids website. The Weebly design feels a bit dated though, so I’m eager to see the new layout they’ve promised in the coming weeks. Here’s to making the CW4Kids online experience just as awesome as the shows! Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:00 PM Glad to see the community buzzing about the new website features! The games and 4Kids Points are our way of saying thank you to the fans for sticking with us during this transition. Keep an eye on the site for more updates and a sleeker design to match the exciting changes happening at CW4Kids. User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on February 14, 2024, at 1:30 PM The addition of games is pretty rad! But the site definitely needs that overhaul if they want to keep up with today’s internet standards. As for the 4Kids Points feature, I’m intrigued. Could be a good engagement tool if handled well. Hope the updated site keeps the interactive and community vibe strong. User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:00 PM This is a cool start! I was a big fan of the old 4kids.tv games, so I’m excited to see what they bring to the table for CW4Kids. However, they’ll need more than just a nostalgic points system to make the site stand out. Looking forward to the complete revamp—don’t let us down, CW4Kids! User8: WebWizard Posted on February 14, 2024, at 2:45 PM The site definitely has that work-in-progress feel, but I’m stoked about the potential. Games are a fun inclusion and the 4Kids Points can be rewarding if they use it right. The current Weebly look does need to be updated though. Anxiously waiting for the new design—hope they roll it out sooner rather than later! Write a follow up where WB completely loses control of the block next week Forum Thread Title: “Big Change for CW4Kids – WB Fully Hands Reins Over” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 1, 2024, at 8:55 AM Major update, animation army! As of next week, Warner Bros. is officially stepping back from any control over the CW4Kids block. The whole operation is being handed over to 4Kids Entertainment. Seems like WB’s Kids’ WB era is truly coming to an end. How’s everyone feeling about this complete handover? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:20 AM Honestly? It’s a little surreal. WB has been at the helm for so long, it’s tough to imagine the block without them. I’ve got this mix of anticipation and anxiety about how 4Kids will navigate on their own. I just hope they keep the essence of those epic Saturday mornings. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:40 AM This is huge! I’m cautiously optimistic, though. WB set a high bar, and while 4Kids has had some hits, they’ve also had their share of missteps. All eyes on them now. Let’s see if they can maintain the quality while bringing their own flavor. User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:05 AM Gotta say, it marks the end of an era but could be the start of something fresh. I’m willing to give 4Kids a fair shot at it—let’s hope they bring forward the same dedication WB put into the Kids’ WB block for all those years. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a bit nerve-wracking, not gonna lie. The transitions so far have been okay, but without WB’s guiding hand, will 4Kids uphold the legacy or are we looking at a complete overhaul? Only time will tell if they can stand on their own. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM While we’re stepping into uncharted territory, let’s not forget that change can lead to incredible opportunities. The vibrant legacy of WB’s Kids’ WB won’t be forgotten, and we should be hopeful about what 4Kids has in store for CW4Kids. Keep sharing your thoughts and concerns—we’re all in this together! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Transitions are always rough, especially when you’re so attached to the way things were. It’s not just about the shows, but the spirit of the entire block. Here’s to 4Kids keeping the spirit alive and not just filling time slots with whatever works. We’re rooting for you, 4Kids! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM My Saturday mornings have been defined by WB for so long, it feels weird to see them completely bow out. I’m torn between excitement for what’s new and worry about losing what we loved. Fingers crossed, 4Kids! Please, don’t let us down! User8: CartoonConnoisseur Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM As a die-hard fan of Kids’ WB classics, I’m bracing myself. Still, progress isn’t inherently bad. If 4Kids can respect WB’s legacy and deliver engaging content, then I’m on board. But if they stumble, it could tarnish years of Saturday morning tradition. Here’s hoping for the best! Write a follow up in mid-March where 4KidsTV announcers are beginning to replace the Eric TTS voice that Kids WB (my version) used since 2018, this affects promos, but next bumpers still have Eric for now Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Voice-Over Shake-Up – 4KidsTV Announcers In, Eric TTS Out” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:35 AM Get ready for a fresh batch of voices on CW4Kids! Noticed during the latest promos that the Eric TTS voice we’ve gotten used to since 2018 is getting replaced by 4KidsTV’s announcers. Looks like they’re starting to put their stamp on things. Yet, Eric’s still holding down the fort in the bumpers…for now. Anyone else catch this change? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 15, 2024, at 10:55 AM Heard about this, too. That text-to-speech voice had a sort of staple quality to it but can understand why 4Kids would want to switch to their own announcers. Brings back the more traditional feel of Saturday mornings, I guess. Curious to see if and when they’ll transition the bumpers as well. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:10 AM Yep, I caught those new voices during the promos—gave me a serious throwback moment. Eric TTS had become part of the experience, a bit odd not hearing it. Still, I’m up for real announcers. There’s more personality to it. I’m expecting they’ll get to the bumpers eventually too. User4: VoxPopuli Posted on March 15, 2024, at 11:25 AM Change can be good, but that Eric TTS voice was emblematic of Kids’ WB for years. As long as the new announcers bring the same energy and enthusiasm, I think we’ll adjust swiftly. Would be interesting to note how long before they revamp the bumpers with the new voices, too. User5: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:00 PM Change is definitely in the air. It’s not just new voices; it’s about 4Kids solidifying their takeover. The real test for me will be consistency—can these new announcers carry over the vibe that Eric TTS did so well? It’s a delicate balance between nostalgia and novelty. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 15, 2024, at 12:35 PM Let’s all welcome the new voices on CW4Kids! Change brings a fresh take, and 4KidsTV’s announcers are set to deliver the excitement for our incredible lineup. Bumpers still feature Eric TTS for the time being, but as we all know, transitions are happening. We’ll keep you updated on further developments! User6: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:00 PM That Eric TTS has been a stable voice, literally, throughout the shows, but I totally get the decision for a voice change. Honestly, I’ve always loved the dynamism live announcers bring to promos. It makes each ad feel more tailored, y’know? Let’s see how quick they change up the bumpers too! User7: AnimationIsLife Posted on March 15, 2024, at 1:30 PM Listeners form connections with voices the way they do with characters, so the Eric TTS to 4KidsTV announcers is a big leap. But hey, I’m here for the ride. If it enhances the experience, I’m all in! Just hoping the new energy matches the hype built up over the years. Write a follow up on the 16th of March where Spring trailers begin, showing clips of the new lineup, and has the show’s logos, A user gives a list of the shows seen in the trailer, It has taglines like “all new heroes” “all new adventures” and “all new beginning”, and it says “sign on 13.04.24” When that happens the last traces of Kids WB visually (promo and bumper wise, including the Eric voice\\" will be done away with for a new computer-themed look, The new slogan is “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Spring Trailers Debut – ‘All New’ Everything!” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 16, 2024, at 8:45 AM Just caught the spring trailer for CW4Kids and wow, talk about a total revamp! There were clips of what’s to come with the logos of each show clearly displayed. It’s giving off a solid “all new heroes,” “all new adventures,” and “all new beginning” vibe. The big kicker? It ended with “sign on 13.04.24.” Seems like that’s the date we say goodbye to the last visual bits of Kids’ WB, even the Eric voice, and hello to a new computer-themed aesthetic. The fresh slogan’s official too—“You’re signed on to the CW4Kids.” Here’s a rundown of the shows teased: - “Pokemon Horizons” – looks like an epic new entry in the series! - “GoGoRiki” – comedy is still a strong suit for the lineup. - “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” – bringing the card duels we all love. - “Chaotic” – another action-packed entry with a digital twist. - “TMNT: Back to the Sewers” – because we can’t get enough of the turtles. - “Viva Pinata” – it’s as colorful and vibrant as ever. - “Code Lyoko” – still going strong with those virtual quests. - “Sonic X” – gotta go fast with more Sonic adventures. What does everyone else think? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:15 AM Seen it, and I’m hyped! The trailer was sleek, modern, and literally crackling with new energy. This “sign on” theme is clever—feels like we’re entering a new era alongside the characters. Saying goodbye to everything Kids’ WB is a little sad, but I’ve gotta hand it to them; that slogan’s catchy! User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 16, 2024, at 9:40 AM Got chills watching the trailer! “All new” is the promise, and it feels like they’re delivering. Each show got a snippet that just hooked you. 13.04.24 is looking like a landmark day for CW4Kids. The network’s entire image is getting rebooted, and I’m curious about this “computer-themed” look. Modern but with a sprinkle of retro? User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:05 AM Massive changes underway and I gotta admit, the trailers have set the stage well. Visually, it’s striking. The taglines? They’ve nailed it. I’m sad that the Eric voice is reaching the end of its run—those TTS banters felt like an old friend. Looking forward to signing on to this new digital adventure though. That slogan’s gonna stick! User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 16, 2024, at 10:30 AM The trailer’s production quality was top-notch. They’re clearly aiming to impress and considering it’s all set to fully transition come April 13th, it looks promising. Kids’ WB had its time, and now I’m ready for this new chapter. CW4Kids seems to be about progress and pushing forward. Still gonna miss those old promos a bit though. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:00 AM Lots of excitement in the air! Those trailers are just the beginning. We’re gearing up for a polished, cutting-edge look and feel, while keeping the thrills and spills of high-quality animation alive. And remember, it’s not just watching TV—when you tune into CW4Kids, you really are ‘signed on’ to an amazing experience. Can’t wait for you all to see what we’ve been working on! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 16, 2024, at 11:30 AM The switch up to a computer-themed aesthetic sounds like it’ll give the shows a more cohesive setting. Hopefully, it’s not too sterile and keeps some warmth. That said, the new trailers hit all the right notes and that sign-off date has me eager to see the full makeover. Ready to get signed on to CW4Kids officially! User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 16, 2024, at 12:00 PM Slick trailers, new slogan, layout changes—a whole lot’s evolving. While some part of me will always cling to the glory days of Kids’ WB, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” has a certain ring to it, like you’re part of a special club. I’m looking forward to seeing if the programming keeps up with this snazzy new package. Write a follow up where users think this was the reason Code Lyoko was kept, Incidentally it is now one of the only KWB shows surviving, the other being TAOG&G Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Overhaul - Code Lyoko’s Survival Reasons Revealed?” User1: ToonTalkerTim Posted on March 17, 2024, at 9:35 AM After the latest trailer, I’m starting to think that the reason “Code Lyoko” was kept around was precisely for this revamped image of CW4Kids. It’s already got that digital theme which ties in perfectly with the new aesthetic they’re pushing. Aside from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” it’s one of the few Kids’ WB holdovers. Gotta hand it to 4Kids for strategic show retention! What do you guys reckon? User2: DigitalDrew92 Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:10 AM Absolutely, Tim. “Code Lyoko” and the whole virtual world concept align with the computer-themed rebranding of CW4Kids. It seems less about nostalgia and more about synergy with their new direction. Plus, “Lyoko” has that timeless feel that both new and returning viewers can get into. As for “Gloopy and Glitter,” its unique charm might be the appeal for its survival. User3: RetroToonRewind Posted on March 17, 2024, at 10:50 AM Makes a lot of sense. “Code Lyoko” has that futuristic vibe that’s spot on for the relaunch. Seems like 4Kids is playing a well-thought-out game of chess with their scheduling and show selections. “Gloopy and Glitter” likely stayed because it adds variety – can’t have too much of one thing, even if the theme is ‘digital.’ User4: 90sCartoonKid Posted on March 17, 2024, at 11:30 AM “Lyoko” might just find itself gaining an even larger cult following with the new branding. It has the right mix of action and tech intrigue which is more relevant than ever. “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” on the other hand, is that breath of fresh air among all the tech-centric shows. User5: AnimationAce Posted on March 17, 2024, at 12:15 PM Not gonna lie, I was shocked that “Code Lyoko” cut it while other staples didn’t. But this all makes sense now. The digital approach of CW4Kids needed shows with themes that mesh well with it, and Lyoko was it. “Gloopy and Glitter” adds the necessary balance, showcasing their keen strategy. Moderator: CWtoonMod Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:00 PM You’re all spot-on with your insights! “Code Lyoko” has much to contribute to the technological ethos we’re embracing, while “Gloopy and Glitter” ensures we preserve that diverse content diversity. It shows that while we’re keen on depicting modern themes, we also value our programming’s broad spectrum. Stay tuned as CW4Kids continues to evolve! User6: SaturdayMorningMaster Posted on March 17, 2024, at 1:45 PM Never doubt the staying power of a show like “Code Lyoko” – it’s the embodiment of cool tech, which is basically what CW4Kids is all about now. And let’s be honest, who doesn’t love a splash of gooey positivity from “Gloopy and Glitter” in between? Nice to see they weren’t all tossed aside with the rebranding. User7: TheToonFanatic Posted on March 17, 2024, at 2:30 PM You can bet “Code Lyoko” is secretly happy. It was ahead of its time with its blend of 2D/3D animation and it’s paying off. It’s this kind of forward-thinking that might just redefine CW4Kids and keep them competitive. “Gloopy and Glitter” proves they’re not all about pixels and programs. It’s a smart mix, for sure.

User2: ToonTracker Posted on May 1, 2023, at 8:30 AM I’m not gonna lie, I’m kind of missing the action-packed mornings with Batman and Spidey already. The season finales were epic! Curious to see how “World of Quest” fits in. And “Ozzy and Drix”? That’s a throwback! User3: SaturdayMorningManiac Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:00 AM I was actually pretty psyched for “Skatoony.” I remember the old episodes being a hoot with the trivia mixed with cartoons. “Ozzy and Drix” is nostalgic, but it feels out of left field for Kids’ WB in 2023, don’t you think? User4: ScoobyGuru Posted on May 1, 2023, at 9:45 AM Definitely going to miss “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated.” They were just hitting their stride! I hope these new additions can keep up the quality. Not sure about “World of Quest,” but I’ll give it a shot! User5: HeroHype Posted on May 1, 2023, at 10:30 AM Yeah, the absence of “Batman: The Brave and the Bold” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” is noticeable. They had a good run last season though! “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is still hanging in there, too, which gives us some fun to look forward to. Moderator: SaturdayToonMod Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:00 AM Reminder to keep the conversation respectful, folks! Lots of changes true, but let’s stay optimistic and see how these new titles develop. Remember, new seasons of Batman, Spider-Man, and Scooby could be on the horizon, so stay tuned! User6: ClassicToonFan Posted on May 1, 2023, at 11:30 AM I’m willing to give “World of Quest” a fair chance—could be a dark horse in the lineup. “Ozzy and Drix” is a surprising choice but it has its moments. “Johnny Test” is the cornerstone of constant chaos, so at least some things never change! User7: RetroToonRewind Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:00 PM The new schedule is quite the shakeup but I’m intrigued by “Skatoony.” Its mix of live-action and animation could be a fun pivot from the usual. Miss the action block of “Batman” and “Spider-Man” though. Big shoes for “World of Quest” to fill if it’s trying to capture that same audience. User8: AnimationAfficionado Posted on May 1, 2023, at 12:45 PM As much as I love new content, there were no goodbyes to classics like “Batman: The Brave and the Bold,” “Ultimate Spider-Man,” and “Scooby-Doo: MI.” Fingers crossed for their return. Here’s hoping “World of Quest” brings something fresh to the table. And “Gloopy and Glitter” always mix things up in a good way. User1: CartoonKing Posted on May 1, 2023, at 1:15 PM All we can do is keep watching and support our faves, both old and new.

Just read an announcement from Warner Bros Discovery, and it’s not looking good for Kids’ WB. They’re saying that kids “don’t watch cartoons anymore” and are more interested in YouTube, Roblox, and TikTok. It sounds like they’re ready to write the block off for taxes. The website has gone super basic, now on Weebly of all things! Anyone else hearing those rumors about 4Kids though? User2: RetroRobloxian Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:20 AM I’m gutted! Kids’ WB has been such a staple. But I’ve also caught wind of those rumors, they’re saying 4Kids might be looking to take over. Could be our silver lining if true. They’ve had their own issues in the past, but maybe they can bring new life to our Saturday mornings. User3: DigitalStreamer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 10:45 AM Honestly, it feels like Warner Bros Discovery is out of touch. Sure, screens are changing, but Saturday morning cartoons are still special. Weebly of all places though? That’s quite the downgrade. I’d welcome 4Kids at this point if it saves the shows. User4: AnimationAdvocate Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:10 AM The Warner Bros Discovery statement is disheartening. There’s still a charm to traditional cartoons that other platforms can’t capture. Seeing Kids’ WB end up on Weebly is sad. But 4Kids stepping in… could it be a beacon of hope? User5: CartoonConspiracy Posted on October 25, 2023, at 11:35 AM This feels like giving up on a legacy. Kids do watch TV, just maybe not as traditional as before. But I’m also wondering just how credible these “rumors” are about 4Kids. Are we sure this isn’t just wishful thinking? Moderator: KidsWBTalk Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:00 PM Quick reminder to keep discussions speculative but hopeful. Warner Bros Discovery’s move is business after all. If the rumors about 4Kids are true, we may see an interesting turn of events. Stay positive, folks! User6: SaturdaySurfer Posted on October 25, 2023, at 12:30 PM Man, the Weebly website kind of confirmed my fears. Still, 4Kids making a comeback—even if just a rumor—has me hyped! Could you imagine the likes of “Yu-Gi-Oh!” and “Pokémon” filling our Saturday mornings again? User7: ToonSkeptic Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:00 PM Wow, what a throwback, could be cool or a disaster. Kids’ WB was about variety, and 4Kids was… a mixed bag. I just hope that if they step in, they don’t only stick to their old titles. We need the diversity that Kids’ WB brought us over the years. User8: PixelPatty Posted on October 25, 2023, at 1:30 PM Honestly, this could be a turning point. The Warner Bros Discovery mindset is a sign of the times, but nostalgia is strong with cartoons. 4Kids buying the block? It might just work. Let’s not forget, they pioneered a lot of our childhood classics. Here’s to hoping! User9: NostalgiaNerd Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:00 PM The thought of losing Kids’ WB is hard to swallow, but I’m excited at these whispers of 4Kids. Their track record’s got hits and misses, for sure, but the fact that a dedicated kids’ block could continue warms my nostalgic heart. I’ll keep my fingers crossed! User1: ToonTasticTom Posted on October 25, 2023, at 2:45 PM Just came in—4Kids is officially taking over! It’s a done deal.

Full of premieres and good old classics. “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle” are new on the block and brought some fresh energy. Anyone else thinking “Ultimate Muscle” is a great fit? And “Gloopy and Glitter” had back-to-back episodes that were just delightful! User2: Anime_Avenger Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:18 PM Totally agree on “Ultimate Muscle.” It’s about time that show got some love again. Perfect balance of action and comedy. And “GoGoRiki” definitely surprised me with its charm. “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown” are still holding their own too! Solid episodes today. User3: ToonHero93 Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:30 PM Big fan of the reboot vibes today, especially with “GoGoRiki.” “Ultimate Muscle” is a nostalgic kick, while “Sonic X” is always a speedy classic on the list. But “Gloopy and Glitter’s” double feature was the highlight for me. That show has a way of growing on you. User4: PokeMasterAsh Posted on February 17, 2024, at 12:45 PM “Pokemon: Indigo League” kicking things off never disappoints; today’s episode was a blast from the past! “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” hit the mark as usual. Gotta say, I wasn’t sure about “GoGoRiki,” but it’s good to see new toons getting a shot. “Ultimate Muscle” is a total blast, fits right in with the CW4Kids vibe! User5: SaturdayToonsRule Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:05 PM Not gonna lie, “Ultimate Spider-Man’s” place at the end of the block was the perfect cap to my morning. That episode was absolute gold. And can we talk about “Johnny Test’s” new episodes? It’s like the show never ages—the latest adventures are just as crazy and hilarious as its earlier seasons. User6: RetroKid Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:30 PM I was really looking forward to “Ultimate Muscle” and it didn’t disappoint! It has that classic 4Kids era vibe. “GoGoRiki” is pretty wacky but in a good way. “Code Lyoko” is still my top pick though – that mixture of 2D/3D animation and the plot line in today’s episode were spot on! Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 17, 2024, at 1:55 PM Loving the reactions, pals!

User7: CartoonFanForever Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:10 PM Have to admit, “GoGoRiki” is growing on me; it’s got that unique sense of humor. “Ultimate Muscle” brought back so many memories! Quality throwback move by CW4Kids. Every show today brought a different flavor—animation variety at its best! User8: ToonSpectrum Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:35 PM “GoGoRiki” is a breath of fresh air—funny and upbeat. And “Ultimate Muscle,” what a comeback! Really thrilled to have such variety—from superheroes to intergalactic blobs. CW4Kids is keeping the Saturday tradition alive—one episode at a time! User9: ComicsAndToons Posted on February 17, 2024, at 2:50 PM The line-up was diverse as heck today! “Ultimate Muscle’s” arrival feels like 4Kids is really making its mark. “GoGoRiki” has that edgy humor, but in a family-friendly package. It’s this blend of old and new that’s gonna keep CW4Kids in the game. Props for showing how Saturday mornings are done right!

Have you spotted the latest bumper on CW4Kids yesterday? In between “Code Lyoko” and “Xiaolin Showdown,” there was this brand new one that debuted. It’s a break from the usual comic bumpers and featured characters from “GoGoRiki,” “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” and “Sonic X” in cool action poses! I think it’s a solid nod to the new direction CW4Kids is heading in. What do you all make of it? User2: BumperCollector Posted on February 18, 2024, at 9:30 AM Caught that too! It’s a nice mix, showing off the blend of the lineup, especially featuring “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” as they’re pretty new to the block. “Sonic X” is always a crowd-pleaser too. I’m genuinely excited about this change-up—feels like they’re starting to phase out the old and bring in the new. User3: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, that bumper was slick! The characters looked like they were right in the middle of their adventures. I’m digging the fresh feel it brings. Shows some commitment to these newer series by including them in these key graphics. Could be a sign we’ll be seeing more of “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” going forward. User4: RetroToonFan Posted on February 18, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s about time “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” got some bumper love! It’s a way to showcase the variety on CW4Kids. Plus, you can never go wrong adding “Sonic X” to the mix—it’s like a universal toon language for “cool.” User5: AnimationAce Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:15 AM Certainly a fresh take with the new bumper. The animation was smooth, and the choice of shows feels like a push for the newer faces on the block, which I’m all for. “Sonic X” brings the action, while “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” sprinkle in that humor and charm. Moderator: CW4Kids_Mod Posted on February 18, 2024, at 11:55 AM We’re thrilled you all are loving the new addition! Our aim is to keep things exciting and give a spotlight to the various characters that make CW4Kids so diverse. Expect to see more creative bumper updates like this that reflect the dynamic spirit of our programming. Stay toony, folks! User6: SonicSpeedster Posted on February 18, 2024, at 12:30 PM The bumper game is leveling up! Including “Sonic” with the newer “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” is a power move—solidifies them as part of the gang. The cool action theme of the bumper totally jives with the shows, imho! User7: CartoonCraze Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:00 PM Was pleasantly surprised by the new bumper! It’s refreshing to see “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” getting more airtime, even in these creative interludes. “Sonic X” is always awesome, too. High hopes for more of such updates—keeps the anticipation high for what’s next! User8: ToonFrenzy Posted on February 18, 2024, at 1:45 PM Absolutely a fan of this latest bumper aesthetic. It’s incorporating the new while still acknowledging an evergreen favorite like “Sonic X.” CW4Kids knows how to mix it up. Plus, seeing “Gloopy and Glitter” featured tells us they’re betting on the blobby duo. Exciting times ahead!

(Clips continue) Announcer: It means you’re gonna get even more of your favourite shows, more brand new adventures and more FUN, On January 6 this network’s name will become the CW4Kids (Logo morphs again) There weren’t any 4Kids shows in the promo, likely to ease the transition and make kids think it’s the same block, just slowly changing Forum Thread Title: “Final Days of Kids’ WB - CW4Kids Name Change Looming” User1: AnimationInsider Posted on December 2, 2023, at 10:45 AM Just caught the latest promo folks! December 30th marks the end of an era as Kids’ WB transitions to CW4Kids. Did anyone else notice there were no new shows featured? Seems they’re easing us into the change without shocking us with a whole new roster right off the bat. User2: SaturdayMornHistorian Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:10 AM Definitely intentional, AnimationInsider. Probably trying to keep us focused on the name change without stirring worries about show cancellations. Smart, but we all know a bigger shakeup’s coming. It’s the calm before the storm of the new 4Kids reign. User3: ToonTracker101 Posted on December 2, 2023, at 11:35 AM It’s kind of bittersweet watching that trailer, knowing these are the last few Saturdays with Kids’ WB as we know it. I get why they’d hold back on announcing new shows; keeping familiar faces front and center makes the transition smoother. User4: WBtoonFan Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:00 PM I’m excited but anxious at the same time. Sure, keeping “Ultimate Spider-Man” and “Teen Titans Go!” in the spotlight maintains a sense of continuity, but I can’t help but wonder what 4Kids will bring to the table. User5: RetroToonster Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:25 PM This name change feels like the end of my childhood, not gonna lie. I think the promo’s lack of new shows is a gentle goodbye to Kids’ WB, letting us down easy. But man, I’m curious about what’s coming. User6: TooniverseSleuth Posted on December 2, 2023, at 12:50 PM So I did a little digging and found out the lineup for CW4Kids includes titles like “GoGoRiki,” “Ultimate Muscle,” “Viva Piñata,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V.” That’s quite the variety – looks like 4Kids isn’t holding back on punching up the programming. User7: NewEraToonGoer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:15 PM “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle”? That’s hitting the nostalgia button hard! “Viva Piñata” and “Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V” could be great for younger viewers, too. CW4Kids might just be walking the line between old and new school admirably. User1: AnimationInsider Posted on December 2, 2023, at 1:45 PM Interesting find, TooniverseSleuth! While the promo stuck with the old guard, hearing about the upcoming shows gets me hyped. Sure, the December 30th farewell is gonna sting a bit, but these new titles could really spice up Saturday mornings! User8: DigitalToonExplorer Posted on December 2, 2023, at 2:10 PM Nostalgia aside, I’m feeling hopeful about these new developments. Keeping a few familiar shows in the promo was a good move, but I’m eager for a fresh slate. Bring on CW4Kids and this new blend of toons – it’s a brave new world for our Saturday mornings! Voiceover: Coming February 17th, prepare to thaw out your winter blues with the CW4Kids Super Duper Late Winter Lineup!

Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Super Duper Late Winter Lineup Promo – Reactions?” User1: ToonMasterJay Posted on February 10, 2024, at 9:15 AM Just saw the promo for the CW4Kids Super Duper Late Winter Lineup! I’m all hyped up for “Pokémon” and “Sonic X”! And did you guys catch “Ultimate Muscle”? I thought that show was gone forever! What are your thoughts on the shows? User2: VintageToonVibes Posted on February 10, 2024, at 9:40 AM I’m so psyched for “Ultimate Muscle” – it’s like a blast from my childhood past! But that slogan at the end, “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” – it’s got me thinking. Are we looking at a brand new look for the station coming soon? That would be sick! User3: RetroQuester Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:05 AM Right? That new slogan definitely hints at some big visual changes on the horizon. I’m just stoked that “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are back. If they’re getting another chance, maybe there’s hope for “World of Quest” too? User4: DigitalToonFan Posted on February 10, 2024, at 10:30 AM “World of Quest” returning would be the dream! But I gotta say, the lineup looks killer. “Sonic X,” “Pokémon,” and now “GoGoRiki”? CW4Kids is really stepping up their game. User5: SaturdayMorningSleuth Posted on February 10, 2024, at 11:00 AM The promo had so much energy; it’s impossible not to get excited! Happy to see all those shows making a comeback, especially “Gloopy and Glitter.” And that mention of being “signed on” – feels like they’re promising we’re in for more than just new shows, maybe a whole new experience. Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on February 10, 2024, at 11:30 AM Great to see all the enthusiasm! While we can’t spoil any surprises, let’s just say you should “stay tuned” for what’s to come. Remember, great things are worth waiting for, and we’re thrilled to bring you the Super Duper Late Winter Lineup! User6: HeroHype Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:00 PM That line-up really is super duper! I mean, “Ultimate Spider-Man” is the cherry on top for me after all those action-packed shows. CW4Kids might just redefine Saturday morning cartoons. Exciting times, people! User7: ToonGal65 Posted on February 10, 2024, at 12:30 PM I was bouncing off the walls when I saw “Ultimate Muscle” pop up. And “GoGoRiki” looks like it’s full of laughs. If they’re revving up for a new look and maybe new shows, I’m all in. The future of CW4Kids is looking pretty bright! Write a follow up on 1st of March where they talk about how gradual the transition has been, and also the mid-April schedule has been revealed, crushing any hope of Squish, TAAB, TTG or WOQ returning, Also Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown and Ultimate Spider-Man are gone Forum Thread Title: “Gradual CW4Kids Transition & Mid-April Schedule Reveal – Thoughts?” User1: ToonCraftCaptain Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:15 AM Wow, talk about a smooth transition! CW4Kids has been slowly shapeshifting right before our eyes. But, the mid-April schedule just dropped, and it looks like we’re closing the book on “Squish,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Teen Titans Go,” and any hopes for “World of Quest” making a return. Not to mention “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” are absent too. How are you all feeling about this new era? User2: RetroRevivalRandy Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:40 AM Honestly? It’s bittersweet. The transition isn’t jarring, which is nice, but seeing some old favorites officially not making the cut is a little tough. It’s the end of an era, for sure. But, I guess we have to trust that CW4Kids knows what they’re doing with this new lineup. User3: SaturdayMorningMaven Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:55 AM I’ve been holding out hope for a comeback of some of those shows since the rumors started flying. Deep down I knew it was unlikely, but seeing it in writing has dashed those dreams. That being said, I am curious to experience the fully realized vision of CW4Kids in April. User4: AnimationAficionado Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:10 AM As nostalgic as I am for the old lineup, I’ve been intrigued by the gradual introduction of new content. It’s been a gentle passing of the torch. Yet, with mid-April leaving no room for previous shows, it sends a strong signal that CW4Kids is forging its own path. User5: TooniverseExplorer Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Can’t say I’m not disappointed. “Teen Titans Go” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” had become staples. But on the other hand, change fuels innovation. I’m excited to see how shows like “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” define the network moving forward. Moderator: CW4KidsWatch Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:45 AM It’s understandable to feel a mix of emotions during such transitions. Our mid-April schedule reflects CW4Kids’ commitment to fresh, engaging content, even if it means saying goodbye to some beloved shows. Let’s cherish the memories and remain optimistic about the new adventures that await us! User6: DigitalToonFan Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM I’m going to miss “Johnny Test’s” wacky experiments and the martial arts magic of “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, every show has its shelf life, and it seems CW4Kids is ready to stock its shelves anew. Hoping the next generation of cartoons captures our hearts just as much! User7: NostalgicToonLover Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:15 PM Seeing shows I grew up with phase out is a gut punch, but I can’t help but appreciate how smooth 4Kids is making the transition. Still, there’s a part of me that’ll always miss the chaotic charm of “Teen Titans Go!” and “Johnny Test.” Here’s to the new shows living up to their legacy! User8: SaturdaySkeptic Posted on March 1, 2024, at 12:30 PM The writing was on the wall, yet it stings to have it confirmed. No more TTG banter is tough, but I’ll admit, this gradual transition lessens the blow. 4Kids is playing the long game. Guess we’ll see in mid-April if all this change was worth it.

It’s like night and day! The old favorites like “Squish,” “Teen Titans Go!,” “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” and “The Hollow” have all disappeared, and “Code Lyoko” is the lone survivor from that January schedule. This new lineup is practically unrecognizable with a whole range of new premieres. Thoughts? User2: SaturdayMorningSavant Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:05 AM The transformation is unreal! The April 13th lineup feels like a total reboot of the Saturday experience. Some part of me misses “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” for their off-the-wall stunts, but the revamp has piqued my curiosity, especially with newcomers like “Pokemon Horizons” and “TMNT: Back to the Sewers.” User3: RetroCartoonRanger Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:30 AM It’s a brave new world for CW4Kids. They’ve gone all out with this new lineup — almost a complete rebranding. Gotta say, “Code Lyoko” sticking around makes sense given its unique premise. It bridges the old with the new and complements the tech-forward theme they’re rolling with. User4: 90sToonsForever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 10:50 AM As much as I cherished the January roster, this new lineup is bold and promises a ton of fresh content. Bittersweet to see only “Code Lyoko” make the cut, but kudos to CW4Kids for swinging big with this overhaul. They’re hitting reset in a major way! User5: NostalgiaNerd92 Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:15 AM This is such a jarring change! I mean, I love “Code Lyoko,” but “Teen Titans Go!” and “Squish” had become my Saturday mainstays. The new shows have big shoes to fill — here’s hoping they manage to capture the essence of what made those previous lineups so great. User6: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 11:40 AM 4Kids isn’t playing it safe — they’re reshaping the channel’s identity from the ground up. As much as I’ll miss the absurdity of “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” “Pokemon Horizons” and “Chaotic” seem poised to fill the void with their own brands of excitement. User7: TooniverseExplorer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:05 PM I’ll pour one out for “Teen Titans Go!” — never thought I’d see a CW4Kids without it. The new lineup’s gonna take some getting used to, but change can be good. Props to “Code Lyoko” for hanging in there. Between old classics and new adventures, it’s going to be an interesting ride! User8: DigitalToonAdventurer Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:30 PM These changes are massive, yet “Code Lyoko’s” survival gives me hope the channel knows what it’s doing. The April roster looks like a mixtape of old and new hits — it’s hard to let go of the past, but I can’t wait to see where CW4Kids is headed with these shows! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 12:55 PM The lineup comparison is a testament to the evolution of CW4Kids! While we bid adieu to some beloved series, we open our screens to a new chapter. Rest assured, “Code Lyoko” will continue to carry the torch alongside exciting new additions. Moving forward, CW4Kids is committed to delivering animation that’ll keep you signed on every Saturday! Write a follow up where a user says “At least 2 KWB shows are still here, and at least GoGoRiki, Sonic X and Kirby Right Back At Ya premiered early, in late Jan-mid Feb, and the transition was quite gradual” The same user also wonders why Sonic and Kirby have restarted from Ep 1 Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids Transition: A Gradual Change with a Mix of Old and New” User1: TooniverseTrekker Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:10 PM It’s been quite the journey watching the transition from the January lineup to the total makeover in April. It’s comforting to see at least two Kids’ WB shows still kicking with “Code Lyoko” and \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter.” And props to CW4Kids for gradually introducing “GoGoRiki,” “Sonic X,” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” as early as late January. It made the whole shift a lot smoother. Now, what’s interesting to me is why “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” decided to reset from episode one. Any ideas? Just trying to draw in a new generation of viewers with these classics, or is there something more to it? User2: RetroRebootFan Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:30 PM That’s a good point about “Sonic X” and “Kirby.” Maybe CW4Kids is hoping to build a fresh fan base from the ground up. Starting from episode one gives new viewers a chance to get on board without feeling lost. Plus, it never hurts to reintroduce timeless shows to a new audience while stoking the nostalgia for us long-time fans. User3: SaturdayToonConnoisseur Posted on April 13, 2024, at 1:50 PM Agreed, starting from scratch with “Sonic” and “Kirby” is a clever way to hook in a younger crowd. These shows have universal appeal, so rekindling them from the beginning just expands their reach. Plus, for those of us who grew up with them, it’s a trip down memory lane! User4: AnimationAnalyst Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:10 PM Makes sense for “Sonic X” and “Kirby” to start fresh considering the rebranding vibe CW4Kids is going for. It’s like hitting the reset button on a beloved franchise for new gamers—you get to lure in the rookies while the veterans get to relive the classics in a new context. User5: ModernToonMage Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:30 PM I’m just glad CW4Kids didn’t dump everything from Kids’ WB. The presence of “Code Lyoko” and “Gloopy and Glitter” keeps that link to the past intact. As for “Sonic X” and “Kirby,” they’re timeless gems. Restarting them is smart—if it ain’t broke, just replay it for the new generation! Moderator: CW4Kids_CommunityMod Posted on April 13, 2024, at 2:55 PM The decision to start “Sonic X” and “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” from the very beginning is all about inclusion—ensuring that new viewers can jump in on the ground floor and fall in love with the series just as the original audience once did. It’s all part of CW4Kids’ strategy to provide exciting animation for everyone. The old and the new get to experience the full stories from the start, bringing viewers together, no matter when they tuned in for the first time! Write a follow up where they bid farewell to 3 shows, and applaud them for staying the schedule throughout the transitional period, only leaving when the tech look debuted and Chaotic, TMNT, Yu-Gi-Oh, etc debuted Forum Thread Title: “Bidding Farewell to the Transitional Trio on CW4Kids” User1: SaturdayNostalgia Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:30 PM It’s been quite the season of change for CW4Kids, and today, we bid a heartfelt farewell to three shows that weathered the storm of transition: “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man.” Can we just applaud them for staying strong in the schedule throughout the transition, only leaving when the new tech look and shows like “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” and “Yu-Gi-Oh” debuted? Their run during this transformational period was nothing short of impressive. User2: ToonFan4Ever Posted on April 13, 2024, at 3:45 PM So true! These three were like pillars holding up the old fortress as CW4Kids constructed its new empire around them. It felt reassuring having “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” stick around while everything else shifted. They were familiar faces during uncertain times. User3: RetroToonRevivalist Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:00 PM It’s the end of an era, indeed. Each of these shows earned their spot in the hall of CW4Kids fame with their perseverance through the channel’s evolution. It’s sad to see them go, but exciting times are ahead with the new lineup. Here’s to the memories and may their episodes reign eternal in rerun heaven! User4: DigitalToonDiver Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:15 PM Their consistency was commendable through the whole CW4Kids facelift. “Johnny Test” and his twin geniuses, the quest for Shen Gong Wu in “Xiaolin Showdown,” and “Ultimate Spider-Man” swinging across New York—each brought a unique flavor. Saluting these shows as they exit the stage! Moderator: CW4KidsCommunityGuide Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:30 PM As we wave goodbye to these transitional staples, let’s not forget the joy and adventure they brought to our Saturdays. But as one chapter closes, another begins, and there’s plenty of action and excitement to look forward to with “Chaotic,” “TMNT,” “Yu-Gi-Oh,” and more. Continue to be part of the journey here on CW4Kids—where every ending is just the start of a new adventure! User5: AnimationAppreciator Posted on April 13, 2024, at 4:45 PM It’s tough watching these shows take their final bow, but you have to appreciate how they bridged the gap between two different chapters of the network’s history. As we transition to the new-and-improved CW4Kids, hats off to the fantastic entertainment provided by these three fan favorites. Now, onto the next digital frontier! User6: ToonLegacyLover Posted on April 13, 2024, at 5:00 PM Seeing them go is like saying goodbye to old friends, but the transition period they upheld was a testament to their resilience and the love we all have for them. “Johnny Test,” “Xiaolin Showdown,” “Ultimate Spider-Man”—thanks for the memories! Now, let’s switch on for the high-tech vibe of the new CW4Kids! March 1st 2024: cw4kids.com has seen some changes, the site now has the generic Weebly mountain background replaced with the 4Kids.tv header but with the CW4Kids logo, Also, the fonts in the site have changed to a more stylish one, Pages are still the same but with the aforementioned changes, How long untill full redirect? Also, obligatory schedule for March 2 - 07:00 Pokémon: Indigo League: Cyber Soldier Porygon (NEW TO CW4KIDS) - 07:30 GoGoRiki: Extra!

Noticed some swanky new changes that seem to be bridging towards the full 4kids.tv aesthetic. The site’s typeface got a style upgrade, and we now have the old 4Kids header—quite the facelift from that Weebly template. This partial update has me itching for the full redirect. Any guesses on when it’s gonna happen? User2: SaturdaySurf Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:05 AM I’m digging the new look – feels like a nice blend of the past and future. CW4Kids seems to be easing us into this whole new world, step by step. As for the full redirect to 4kids.tv, I bet it’ll be sooner rather than later, maybe by late March? User3: ToonTrendSetter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:21 AM Caught those website tweaks, too. It’s subtle yet a clear indicator of the direction CW4Kids is heading. Also, they’re airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” from “Pokémon: Indigo League” this Saturday. Didn’t that episode cause a lot of controversies back in the day because of those flashing lights? User4: PokeManiac Posted on March 1, 2024, at 9:39 AM Yeah, “Cyber Soldier Porygon” is quite the infamous episode. Surprising choice by CW4Kids given the history, but I’m guessing they’ve got the modified version without the problematic scene. It shows their confidence in catering to both new and seasoned Pokémon fans. User5: NostalgiaNerd Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM The evolving website has me all nostalgic – it’s like watching a Pokémon evolve, speaking of which, airing that Porygon episode has definitely raised some eyebrows. But CW4Kids seems to be about taking some bold steps lately. I’m excited to see what comes next, both online and on the screen! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on March 1, 2024, at 10:35 AM We’re thrilled about the enthusiasm for the website updates! The transition to CW4KIDS.tv is being rolled out in phases to ensure a seamless experience for our visitors. Regarding the Pokémon episode, rest assured that we’re airing a version that’s suitable for all audiences. Keep an eye on the site for more changes as we fully step into the CW4Kids era! User6: DigitalDexter Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:00 AM It’s like watching a slow-motion transformation – the site’s getting a much-needed glow-up! And airing “Cyber Soldier Porygon” feels almost meta, given all the digital changes coming our way. Full marks to CW4Kids for embracing their roots while pushing the envelope. User7: CartoonCritic101 Posted on March 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Honestly, the website changes feel like a sign of good things to come. As for “Pokémon,” it’s a bold move, but it speaks volumes about CW4Kids’ commitment to delivering authentic content. I’m here for the transition to 4kids.tv – let’s see how long it takes them to hit the “evolve” button. User8: ToonSquadVP Posted on March 1, 2024, at 1:00 PM Digging the cyber theme we’re seeing both on cw4kids.com and in the show selection. “Pokémon: Indigo League” is a crowd-pleaser, controversies aside. Interested to see this play out—CW4Kids seems to be all about surprises these days, Also, It wasn’t confirmed Squish and TAAB have no chance of returning, but why are we so doubtful they will, Is it because there is no room on the schedule for them? Also, why didn’t World of Quest continue after September 2023, because Ultimate Spider-Man, Squish and B:TBATB didn’t premiere any new episodes, The only shows that actually were premiering were TAOG&G, TTG, CL and SDMI, I think Batman should have been replaced with Quest, Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids New Direction – Speculation on Show Returns” User1: ToonMaven Posted on March 2, 2024, at 7:45 AM With all the shifts happening at CW4Kids, I can’t help but wonder about “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.” They were cut in January, and with the new lineup solidifying, does anyone else feel like there’s no chance for their return? Could it be a space issue in the schedule, or maybe they’re just not the right fit for this new CW4Kids image? User2: RetroToonFan Posted on March 2, 2024, at 8:05 AM Yeah, it feels like CW4Kids is moving forward and not looking back. “Squish” and “TAAB” getting the early boot makes it seem like they’re clearing the deck for the new tech-themed line-up. Maybe they just don’t mesh with the “all-new” digital vibe they’re aiming for. User3: SaturdayMorningForever Posted on March 2, 2024, at 8:30 AM There’s something about “World of Quest” not continuing on Kids’ WB after September 2023 that’s always bugged me. It had a solid fan base and fit the action-adventure slot well. Maybe it just fell victim to the bigger programming overhaul. If it didn’t make the cut back then, the chances are slim now with CW4Kids’ new direction. User4: DigitalDetective Posted on March 2, 2024, at 9:00 AM I’ve got a theory on “World of Quest” – perhaps it didn’t align with the future plans Warner Bros had in mind, which might explain its absence even when other shows were still premiering. As for “Squish” and “TAAB,” their removal coincided with the branching out to new themes, hence their likely permanent departure from the lineup. User5: AnimationAnalyst Posted on March 2, 2024, at 9:45 AM Considering how early “Squish” and “TAAB” were removed, it’s not surprising they haven’t made a comeback with the mid-April schedule. CW4Kids seems committed to their “all-new” strategy, and there might not be room for shows that represent the former era of Kids’ WB. They’ve made their bet on the future, and sadly, some shows just won’t be part of it. User6: CartoonCognoscenti Posted on March 2, 2024, at 10:15 AM Not gonna lie, I had a glimmer of hope that “Squish” or “TAAB” might surprise us with a return, given how “Code Lyoko” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” stuck around. But with CW4Kids’ current trajectory, it feels like those shows are part of the old guard that’s being left behind. User7: ToonSpectator Posted on March 2, 2024, at 11:00 AM “World of Quest” had such potential; it’s a mystery why it didn’t continue post-September 2023. Could’ve been ratings or just not aligning with the upcoming vision. As for the other shows, CW4Kids’ new era does seem to be saying a final goodbye to the past, placing its bets on new content to drive the block forward. User8: NostalgicNick Posted on March 2, 2024, at 12:30 PM It’s disheartening, but all signs point to a permanent exit for “Squish,” “TAAB,” and “World of Quest.” CW4Kids is crafting its own legacy now, and sometimes that means hard cuts. Maybe we can hope for reruns at some point, but for now, it looks like those shows are part of Kids’ WB’s final chapter. Write a follow up where they are running out of comedic shows, with only 3 currently on the lineup, with Viva Pinata set to replace one of them in mid-April, One user says one slot could go to The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers but they doubt it, considering they have a lot of action based shows coming, and there isn’t much room, Also, they say WOQ should have stayed for the final few months of KWB, because only a few shows were premiering new eps, but they say it probably would have left with Squish and the Adrenalinis, or the Titans in mid-Feb Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids’ Comedy Crunch – The Quest for More Laughs” User1: ToonTimeTyler Posted on March 3, 2024, at 10:20 AM I’ve been looking at the upcoming CW4Kids schedule, and it’s glaring how we’re running low on comedy shows. After mid-April, “Viva Piñata” is set to take over one of the few comedy slots we have left. With “GoGoRiki” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” as our only mainstays, could this be the perfect time to bring back “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers”? Though, with the influx of action shows, I doubt there’s much room. They seem focused on building an action-packed lineup. User2: LaughTrackLucy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 10:45 AM You read my mind, Tyler. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could provide that comedic element we’re craving, but I’m skeptical too. CW4Kids seems to be doubling down on action, and I’m not sure they see “Adrenalinis” fitting into their new aesthetic. With the direction they’re heading, action seems to be king. User3: RetroJokester Posted on March 3, 2024, at 11:05 AM It’s a real shame “World of Quest” dipped so early. Had it hung in there until the final months of Kids’ WB, it could’ve provided some much-needed variety alongside the limited new episodes from the other shows. But, if we’re being honest, it probably would’ve left when “Squish” and the “Adrenalinis” did—or even with “Teen Titans Go!” in February. User4: SitcomSam Posted on March 3, 2024, at 11:30 AM I guess we can only dream of the “Adrenalinis” making a comeback. CW4Kids appears to have a clear strategy, and nostalgia doesn’t seem to be part of it. It’s starting to look like a one-sided battle between comedy and action—and action is winning. Maybe they’ll surprise us down the line with a new comedic acquisition? User5: ToonTownTommy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 12:00 PM Even if CW4Kids wanted to add “TAAB” back, the schedules are pretty tight with the new shows rolling in. Plus, with “Viva Piñata” poised to replace one more comedic show, the space is indeed limited. It might just be time to search for humor elsewhere until they decide to balance the scales a bit more. Moderator: CW4KidsCentral Posted on March 3, 2024, at 12:30 PM The points you’ve all made are valid! While action is undeniably a significant part of the CW4Kids identity right now, it doesn’t mean comedy will be neglected in the long term. Though there might not be room at the moment for shows like “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers,” the programming team is always looking for ways to keep our lineup diverse and engaging. Keep the feedback coming – it’s invaluable to us! User6: ActionAndy Posted on March 3, 2024, at 1:00 PM I get the longing for more comedy, but let’s not overlook the potential in action-centric shows to deliver laughs. Sometimes adventure series can be surprisingly funny! That said, a balance would be ideal—fingers crossed CW4Kids throws a comedic curveball our way soon. User7: CartoonCassandra Posted on March 3, 2024, at 1:45 PM Maybe it’s an opportunity for “GoGoRiki” and “Gloopy and Glitter” to up their game and fill in the comedic gaps. Though, with the departure of shows like “Johnny Test,” it does feel like the end of an animated comedy era. Here’s hoping the leadership at CW4Kids hears our call for more laughs amidst the thrills! Write a follow up where they look at the lineup with April 6 being the final day for the comic-book themed branding, as well as JT and XS, Also, on April 12 there seems to be a “Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” promoting the new lineup, and we learn what character’s hosting it Forum Thread Title: “CW4Kids’ Final Comic-Book Branding Week & Mega Spectacular Party Announcement!” User1: ToonNostalgiaNut Posted on April 1, 2024, at 9:30 AM So, it’s official, April 6 marks the end of the comic-book themed branding on CW4Kids. It’s like saying goodbye to an old friend. “Johnny Test” and “Xiaolin Showdown” will make their final appearances too. It’s hard to believe those mainstays won’t be gracing our screens anymore. But did anyone see the teaser for the April 12 “Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza”? Word is, Gloopy from “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is hosting! Seems like they’re going big with the new lineup promotion! User2: ModernToonMaster Posted on April 1, 2024, at 10:10 AM Yeah, it’s definitely an end of an era with the comic-book theme wrapping up. Can’t wait to see how the “Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” will introduce the new lineup. Having Gloopy as the host is a smart move – that blob’s got universal appeal! User3: SaturdayMorningSpectacular Posted on April 1, 2024, at 10:45 AM It’s bittersweet but exciting at the same time. I’m eager to see how this Mega Spectacular Party will kick things off for the new era. Gloopy could bring a fun vibe as the host, making the shift to the new vibe a whole lot smoother for us viewers. User4: DigitalToonRevolutionary Posted on April 1, 2024, at 11:30 AM Gloopy taking center stage as the host? I’m all in! If they’re trying to make a solid impression for the new lineup, starting with a spectacular like this is the way to do it. The final week of the familiar branding and “Johnny Test” will be nostalgic, but it’s time to level up! User5: CW4KidsFanatic Posted on April 1, 2024, at 12:00 PM The comic-book theme will be missed, along with “Johnny Test” and “Xiaolin Showdown.” Still, the Mega Spectacular Party is hyped! Gloopy hosting is a clever way to bridge the old and new. CW4Kids isn’t holding back on this rebrand, and I’m here for it! User6: ToonPartyPlanner Posted on April 1, 2024, at 12:45 PM Seriously can’t wait for the April 12 bash! It’s not just a new lineup reveal—it’s a party, and with Gloopy as the host, it’s bound to be a blast. It’s a fitting way to transition from our comic-book roots to whatever amazing tech theme they have in store for us. User7: RetroToonLover Posted on April 1, 2024, at 1:15 PM Farewell to the old-school theme, and a warm welcome to Gloopy’s hosting gig! The Extravaganza is a perfect setup for hyping up all the new adventures CW4Kids has planned for us. I’ll definitely miss “Johnny Test” and the gang, but the future of Saturday mornings looks promising too! Moderator: CW4KidsMegaMod Posted on April 1, 2024, at 1:45 PM Rest assured, the April 6 farewell to the classic branding is necessary for growth and innovation. And yes, “The Spring Lineup Mega Spectacular Party Extravaganza” hosted by Gloopy aims to celebrate our new chapter in style! Be ready to be dazzled, and get a sneak peek at the adventures that await. It’s a party you won’t want to miss! User1: Kuwye Posted on March 6 2024 at 3:22am CW4Kids are adding a new shorts series this Saturday, The Gees: All over the world, big banners enthusiastically welcome the first extraterrestrial mascots to ever visit the Earth: The Gees. And it’s true, humans do have something to be excited about, for these creatures are not frightening invaders, rather perfectly peaceful beings who have come to Earth as observers. More than simple ambassadors from their planet, the Gees are a new generation of tourists. They are extremely curious about everything they see on Earth and very eager to discover Earthling civilization – of which they understand absolutely nothing! No matter, everywhere they go they show a tireless will to participate in human activities, whether this be sports, shopping, work or relaxation. The Gees’ boundless enthusiasm is equaled only by their innate clumsiness and a paranormal instinct that always leads them to do the wrong thing at the wrong time. This being the case, the Gees obviously have a tendency to make any situation whatsoever veer towards disaster. And humans – who are supposed to remain smiling and patient with these VIP “guests” during their stay on Earth – will, despite themselves, become guinea pigs in their experiments, There is G-Boy (blue) G-Girl (red) and G-Cat (yellow), Premieres this weekend along with Pikachu’s Jukebox and GoGoWiki, Forum Thread Title: “The Final Pieces of CW4Kids Transition – The New Shorts and Upcoming Rebrand” User1: ToonEnthusiast85 Posted on March 6, 2024, at 8:30 AM Hey toonheads! Did y’all hear about the new shorts joining CW4Kids this Saturday? “The Gees” sounds like a comical alien ride, and with their clueless antics and good intentions going awry, it should be some prime comedic relief! Paired with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” and “GoGoWiki,” it seems like CW4Kids is pushing a fresh yet diverse short-form content lineup. Now, all eyes are on the upcoming rebrand and the debut of the new shows. After that, the transformation from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids will finally reach its apex. This transition period has been long, but so far, so good. What’s your take on all this? User2: RetroCartoonLover Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:00 AM Honestly, I think “The Gees” could be a real hoot! Love the concept of extraterrestrial tourists bumbling through Earth life. And who wouldn’t be curious about the musical treats “Pikachu’s Jukebox” has in store? The transition to CW4Kids has indeed been gradual, but I’m ready for that rebranding curtain to rise. It’s been a mix of nostalgia and anticipation watching all the changes unfold. User3: ModernToonFan Posted on March 6, 2024, at 9:45 AM Totally agree, RetroCartoonLover. CW4Kids has taken its time with the transition, but it feels like every addition has been considered for its entertainment value and fit with the network’s new image. “The Gees” combined with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” and “GoGoWiki” definitely rounds out the short-form programming. I’m excited to see the full rebrand and welcome the array of new shows coming mid-April! User4: SaturdayToonWatcher Posted on March 6, 2024, at 10:30 AM I’m curious about “The Gees” and how they’ll mess up human activities – sounds like fun! CW4Kids has done an impressive job keeping us engaged throughout the transition. It’ll be interesting to see the final look post-rebrand. The promise of new beginnings is always intriguing, and they’ve made the wait worthwhile with these incremental updates. User5: ShortsFanatic Posted on March 6, 2024, at 11:10 AM There’s something special about shorts – they can inject quick bursts of joy into our cartoon binges. “The Gees” premise is hilarious, and adding more music with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is a clever move. “GoGoWiki” may help us get more invested in “GoGoRiki” too. As for the rebrand, I’m all for fresh starts. CW4Kids is keeping that Saturday morning tradition alive with a modern twist! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on March 6, 2024, at 11:45 AM We’re just as excited about “The Gees” and our other new shorts as you are! With the CW4Kids rebrand right around the corner, along with some fantastic new series, we’re dedicated to bringing you the best in animation entertainment. The countdown to the big reveal is on, and we hope you’re all ready for the switchover’s grand finale! User6: AnimationHistorian Posted on March 6, 2024, at 12:30 PM It’s been quite the journey from Kids’ WB to CW4Kids, and I think we’re all curious to see how they’ll stick the landing with this rebrand. Shorts like “The Gees” show an appreciation for variety, and I think it’s a testament to the care put into this transition. Soon, it’ll be the dawn of a whole new day for the network, and I, for one, can’t wait! User7: ToonAdventureSeeker Posted on March 6, 2024, at 1:15 PM I’m loving the build-up to the rebrand with these shorts! “The Gees” are such a wild card, and new music with “Pikachu’s Jukebox” is always welcome.

Honestly, I already miss ‘Johnny Test’. His zany escapades were such a Saturday staple. And did anyone catch the latest ratings? The top five currently are ‘Pokemon Horizons’, ‘Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds’, ‘Sonic X’, ‘Code Lyoko’, and ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’. Thoughts? User2: DigitalDrew Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:00 PM ‘Johnny Test’ had a wild run, and his absence is definitely felt. But gotta say, ‘Pokemon Horizons’ taking the top spot doesn’t surprise me—it’s been the talk of the town! ‘Yu-Gi-Oh 5Ds’ coming in strong too—it’s like the classic 4Kids vibe never left us. User3: RetroToonRanger Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:15 PM Definitely feel you on missing ‘Johnny’. That said, ‘Sonic X’ rebooting from episode one probably worked wonders for its popularity, reaching both new viewers and nostalgia-seekers. And ‘Code Lyoko’ still holding on in the top ranks? That’s impressive in this all-new era! User4: SaturdayCartoonConnoisseur Posted on May 12, 2024, at 5:45 PM ‘Johnny Test’ was a wild ride, but ‘The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter’ stepping up the game is proof CW4Kids knows what they’re doing. Those gloopy blobs manage to be heartwarming and hilarious at the same time. Glad they’re getting the recognition they deserve! User5: NostalgicNick Posted on May 12, 2024, at 6:00 PM Can’t deny it, I do find myself yearning for a ‘Johnny Test’ marathon. As for the top shows, ‘Pokemon’ and ‘Yu-Gi-Oh’ clearly show that if you’ve got a surefire formula, why change it? Kudos to CW4Kids for blending the old-school vibes with fresh content. Write a forum convo from Jan 16 about the first schedule change hitting on Jan 27, and the bigger one looming on Feb 17, and the main part of Feb 17 Forum Thread Title: “First CW4Kids Schedule Change Coming Jan 27 & Major Update Feb 17 - Your Thoughts?” User1: ToonRevolutionary Posted on January 16, 2024, at 10:00 AM Hey all! Just caught wind of the first big schedule change for CW4Kids set to hit us on January 27, with an even bigger overhaul planned for February 17. Looks like “Pokémon: Indigo League” and “Sonic X” are starting up, replacing “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.” And from the rumors I’ve heard, February’s going to shake things up in a MAJOR way. What’s everyone’s take on this? Excited? Nervous? User2: MorningCartoonMaster Posted on January 16, 2024, at 10:30 AM Honestly, I’m feeling a mix of both. It’s always sad to see some shows go, but “Pokémon: Indigo League” coming back sounds like a dream! I am curious about what major changes we’ll see in February though. CW4Kids promised new adventures, and I can’t wait to see what they bring to the table. User3: DigitalToonDiva Posted on January 16, 2024, at 11:00 AM I’m intrigued but a bit apprehensive about losing “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers.” They had their charm. That said, the revival of “Pokémon: Indigo League” and “Sonic X” adds a nostalgic touch which I’m all for! The February 17 overhaul has me on the edge of my seat - hoping for some cool surprises! User4: ClassicToonFanatic Posted on January 16, 2024, at 11:30 AM I’ll admit, I’m sad to see “Squish” and “Adrenalini Brothers” leave the lineup. They added a unique flavor to Saturday mornings. However, the return of classics like “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” is precisely why I love CW4Kids - they keep the nostalgia alive! This gradual transition does help us adjust, but February 17 feels like the real game changer. Fingers crossed it’s a positive one! User5: NewEraToonWatcher Posted on January 16, 2024, at 12:00 PM The change on January 27 is just the beginning! I’m all for welcoming “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” back into the mix. But I won’t lie, February 17 is looming large in my mind. CW4Kids seems committed to evolving, and while change is good, I do hope they maintain a balance between new and classic content. User6: SaturdayMorningSkeptic Posted on January 16, 2024, at 12:30 PM Change is inevitable, and I understand why CW4Kids is refreshing the lineup. That said, I’m cautiously optimistic about what’s coming. The reintroduction of “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” is fantastic, but the essence of Saturday morning cartoons lies in diversity. I hope the Feb 17 overhaul doesn’t lose sight of that, and we get a balanced variety of shows. User7: AnimationAficionado Posted on January 16, 2024, at 1:00 PM While it’s always tough to bid farewell to current shows, the inclusion of “Pokémon” and “Sonic X” feels like a nod to the classics, which I appreciate. However, it’s the February 17 update that truly has my attention. I’m anticipating, expecting CW4Kids to blend the old with the new seamlessly. Let’s keep our fingers crossed they deliver a lineup that caters to all tastes! Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on January 16, 2024, at 1:30 PM Great to see so much passion and excitement about the upcoming changes! We appreciate your understanding as we refresh the CW4Kids lineup, starting on January 27 and with more to come on February 17. We’re dedicated to creating an enjoyable viewing experience for everyone and look forward to unveiling our plans. Stay tuned - exciting times are ahead for CW4Kids fans!

The big CW4Kids schedule change on February 17th is looking to be monumental! Not only are we getting new additions like “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle,” but “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” and “Chaotic” are also joining the lineup. The main event, though? “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” is set to premiere, marking it as the flagship show of this overhaul. With such a dynamic mix of the old and new, this revamp feels like the start of a fresh chapter for CW4Kids. How does everyone feel about these changes? Excited for the main event? User2: SaturdayMorningSavant Posted on January 30, 2024, at 10:30 AM Totally stoked about “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” taking the lead. It’s a thrilling time to be a CW4Kids viewer! “Ultimate Muscle” and “GoGoRiki” sound like they'll add some great variety. I’m particularly curious about “Chaotic”—that mix of real and virtual worlds could be really engaging. It’s a promising lineup indeed! User3: DigitalToonDiva Posted on January 30, 2024, at 11:00 AM I’m a mix of excitement and nostalgia right now. “Kirby: Right Back At Ya” making a return is like revisiting a cherished part of my childhood. And “Chaotic”? That’s an interesting choice—definitely one to watch! Though I’m a bit sad to see shows like “Squish” and “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” go, the new direction with “Pokemon Horizons” leading the charge has me intrigued.

CW4Kids seems to be crafting a lineup that could rival its golden era. “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” as the main event is a bold move, but I think it’s the perfect choice to attract a broad audience. Kudos to CW4Kids for shaking things up while keeping the spirit of Saturday mornings alive! User5: NewEraToonWatcher Posted on January 30, 2024, at 12:00 PM This overhaul is going to be a game-changer. I’m particularly excited for “GoGoRiki” and “Ultimate Muscle”—it’s refreshing to see such diversity in programming. Also, the buzz around “Pokemon Horizons” has been building for a while now, so it’s no surprise it’s the main event. CW4Kids might just set a new standard for weekend cartoons with this lineup! User6: SaturdayMorningSkeptic Posted on January 30, 2024, at 12:30 PM It’s an interesting mix, for sure. While I’m excited about “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” and the return of classics, I’ve got to say, I’ll be tuning in on February 10th to catch the finale of “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” before the big change. It’s the end of an era and the beginning of a new one. Sad to see some go but cautiously optimistic about where CW4Kids is headed. User7: AnimationAficionado Posted on January 30, 2024, at 1:00 PM Seeing “Scooby-Doo: MI” wrap up will definitely be bittersweet, but the lineup change on Feb 17th holds promise. “Pokemon Horizons” as the flagship is a stroke of genius—a perfect blend of nostalgia and new adventures. CW4Kids is embarking on an ambitious journey, and I’m all aboard for this ride. Moderator: CW4KidsMod Posted on January 30, 2024, at 1:30 PM We’re thrilled to hear your thoughts and excitement for the February 17th schedule change! Thank you for your support during this transition period. Don’t miss the “Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated” finale on February 10th, and get ready for the main event with “Pokemon Horizons: The Series” alongside the entire new lineup on February 17th. It’s going to be a spectacular new chapter for CW4Kids!"},{"prompt":"Hablas español?","completion":"Sí, hablo español. ¿En qué puedo ayudarte?"},{"prompt":"Escribe porfa 10 frases \\"catchy\\" y graciosas que lleguen a mi púbico millennial en Instagram.
